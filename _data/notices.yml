          We did not originally have a data retention policy covering data uploaded to user's FTP folders. We will be instituting a policy that any data left in FTP (and not imported into Galaxy) for more than 3 months will be removed. Please import any old data you wish to keep, and contact us if you have any questions!

          The policy will go into August 1st, 2019
