# EuroScienceGateway
---
With the [EuroScienceGateway](https://eurosciencegateway.eu) (ESG) project, the European Galaxy community received a direct funding for the first time from the European Commission through a successful Horizon-Europe grant. Since September 2022, this project allows us together with 15 European partners to leverage a federated open access computational infrastructure through Galaxy as a gateway for data resources, tools and applications by the FAIR principle. It provides more resources for users (via Galaxy and Coud APIs) to all users in Europe - national Galaxy servers included.
