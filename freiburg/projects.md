# EuroScienceGateway
---
With the [EuroScienceGateway](https://eurosciencegateway.eu) (ESG) project, the European Galaxy community received a direct funding for the first time from the European Commission through a successful Horizon-Europe grant. Since September 2022, this project allows us together with 15 European partners to leverage a federated open access computational infrastructure through Galaxy as a gateway for data resources, tools and applications by the FAIR principle. It provides more resources for users (via Galaxy and Coud APIs) to all users in Europe - national Galaxy servers included.

# Bioconda and BioContainers
---

Spending valuable time in compilation/installation should not be a problem nowadays. Therefore, the Freiburg Galaxy team is leading the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io) and [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro) projects, which together form the best stack for reproducible science ever.

Bioconda is a channel for the conda package manager specializing in bioinformatics with around 9,000 bioinformatics packages ready to use with `conda install`. 

BioContainers is an open source and community-driven framework which provides system-agnostic executable environments for bioinformatics software, with around 70,000 containers ready to use.

### MIRACUM

The goal of the [MIRACUM (Medical Informatics for Research and Care in University Medicine)](https://www.miracum.org) project is to foster IT innovations for healthcare research and medical care. The project aims for accessibility and usability of clinical data, imaging data and data from molecular and genomics analyses at local and across different locations through a modular, scalable and federated data integration center. Taking advantage of digitalization in medicine, linking data and generating medical knowledge is required for a better, data-based healthcare delivery system. MIRACUM unites 10 university hospitals, 2 universities, and an industrial partner from 7 German federal states.
