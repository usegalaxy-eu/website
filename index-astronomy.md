## Getting started

Are you new to Galaxy, or returning after a long time, and looking for help to get started? Take [a guided tour](https://materials.usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.galaxy_ui){:target="_top"} through Galaxy's user interface.


## Join the Astronomical Galaxy Community

Please contact [Volodymyr Savchenko](mailto:Volodymyr.Savchenko@epfl.ch?subject=Astro%20Galaxy%20Community) if you want to join.

## Tools

The tools for astronomy include general-purpose tools to work with the FITS format, an interface to query archives via TAP protocol, tools for the reduction of the data from different observatories, and observation modelling tools.
For our observatory-specific tools we use [the automated procedure](https://odahub.io/docs/guide-galaxy) to produce [Galaxy tools](https://github.com/esg-epfl-apc/tools-astro) from notebooks.
 

## Workflows

The workflows are being published [on workflowhub](https://workflowhub.eu/tags/422#workflows).
