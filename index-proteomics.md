# Welcome to **Galaxy Proteomics**

*This European Galaxy branches off from the main [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu){:target="_blank"} server and focuses on one specific domain: Proteomics.*

**Galaxy Proteomics** is a multiple 'omics' data analysis platform with particular emphasis on mass spectrometry-based proteomics. It is hosted by GalaxyEU and maintained by the [GalaxyP team](http://galaxyp.org){:target="_blank"} from the University of Minnesota, MN, USA.

Feel free to check out another server maintained by the GalaxyP team: [Proteogenomics Gateway](http://galaxyp-proteogenomics.duckdns.org){:target="_blank"}.
