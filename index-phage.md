# Welcome to the Phage Galaxy!

**Phage Galaxy** is  a web platform to analyze phage data. This includes tools useful for next-generation sequence assembly, annotation pipelines, comparative analyses, and genome visualization. Here you will find all the software produced by the <a href="https://cpt.tamu.edu">Center for Phage Technology at Texas A&M University</a>. To get started, visit our tutorials below.

**Phage Galaxy** is still under development! Links to our annotation workflows will be made avalable once they are fully functional.

# Resources

## Phage Annotation Pipeline
The latest robust structural and functional annotation workflows are available under Shared Data > Workflows. Our workflows are all labeled with the **CPT** tag for easy searching.

## Apollo annotator
The Phage Galaxy is connected to Apollo via the Apollo Bridge tools, which allow Galaxy to read and write data in the Apollo instance that is also hosted by usegalaxy.eu. Apollo can be accessed from within Galaxy or directly via the link below. You must be logged in to usegalaxy.eu to use Apollo.

## Tutorials list
Our training material in Galaxy Tranining Network format is tailored specifically to phage analysis, including identification of introns and lysis genes. Our training modules describe the use of Galaxy, Apollo, and our tools and workflows. We also have a user FAQ that answers questions about Galaxy and Apollo usage for phage annotation.
