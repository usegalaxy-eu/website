# Getting Started
**Phage Galaxy** is  a web platform to analyze phage data. This includes tools useful for next-generation sequence assembly, annotation pipelines, comparative analyses, and genome visualization. Here you will find all the software produced by the Center for Phage Technology at Texas A&M University. To get started, visit our tutorials below.

# Resources

## Phage Annotation Pipeline
The latest robust structural annotation workflow and functional annotation workflow are available under Shared Data > Workflows. 

## Tutorials list
Our training material in Galaxy Tranining Network format are tailored specifically to phage analysis, including identification of introns and lysis genes. We also have a user FAQ that answers questions about Galaxy and Apollo usage for phage annotation.
