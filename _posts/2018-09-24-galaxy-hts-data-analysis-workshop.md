A new Galaxy workshop on HTS data analysis was held in Freiburg last week. During this week, the [Freiburg Galaxy Team](https://usegalaxy.eu/freiburg/) and [Bionformatics facility from the MPI-IE Freiburg](https://www.ie-freiburg.mpg.de/bioinformaticsfac) offered an introductory course to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data using Galaxy:

- Monday 17th: HTS and Galaxy presentations and introduction by Thomas Manke and Björn Grüning, with the help of Mehmet Tekman
- Tuesday 18th: Quality control, Mapping, ChIP-seq analysis by Bérénice Batut and Leily Rabbani, with the help of Devon Ryan
- Wednesday 19th: RNA-seq analysis by Anika Erxleben and Bérénice Batut, with the help of Pavan Videm and Mehmet Tekman
- Thursday 20nd: HiC data analysis by Ralf Gilsbach, Devon Ryan and Joachim Wolff
- Friday 21st: Exercises & discussion

2 Master students, 16 PhD students, 5 Post-docs and 2 PIs participated to this workshop. Their feedbacks were good: 8% considered the course as good, 54% as very good and 39% excellent, all participants will recommend it and 96% will use Galaxy for future projects. A quite sucessful week then!
