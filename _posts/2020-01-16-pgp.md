title: Human multi-omics data from UK Personal Genome Project accessible through UseGalaxy.eu
---

The [Personal Genome Project UK](https://www.personalgenomes.org.uk/) (PGP-UK)
provides unprocessed genome, methylome and transcriptome data of
participants, together with phenotypic data and pregenerated standardized
analysis results and reports, through their
[data portal](https://www.personalgenomes.org.uk/data).

PGP-UK is one of few projects world-wide to recruit all participants under open
consent which enables them to provide all patient data under open access.
As such, this data collection is not only an excellent resource for researchers
that want to develop and evaluate tools and algorithms for the analysis of such
*omics data, but also offers a great opportunity to train yourself and/or
others in the analysis of large human *omics data.

**Data accessible on Galaxy Europe**

As announced also in the project's
[blog post](https://pgpukblog.wordpress.com/2019/12/18/reaching-for-the-stars-pgp-uk-multi-omics-data-now-also-available-on-galaxy-europe/)
the so-called *multi-omics reference panel* described in
[Chervova, *et al.*, Sci Data 6, 257 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0205-4)
is now accessible directly on Galaxy Europe.

By this we mean that the complete panel, consisting of the unprocessed data,
but also pregenerated results, from the 10 participants with complete -
whole-genome, methylome and transcriptome - multi-omics data is available to
you as a public
[shared data library](https://usegalaxy.eu/library/list#/folders/F43c642051145b1b6)
for importing into histories without download delay and without having the data
count towards your user quota!

We encourage all interested users of Galaxy Europe to use the data

- for trainings
- to put their own data analysis skills to the test
- to establish new analysis workflows
- *etc.*

The [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) provides
hands-on tutorials to get you started with the analysis of this kind of data,
specifically, under the topics of
[Variant analysis](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/),
[Epigenetics](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/epigenetics/)
and
[Transcriptomics](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/)
, and we would love to get feedback from you regarding the usefulness of the
tutorials for analyzing real-world human data.
