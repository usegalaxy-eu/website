title: Use the power of pandas / numpy to transform tabular datasets in a myriad of ways with our new Table Compute tool.
---

With [Table Compute](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/table_compute/table_compute/0.9.2) you
can:
- drop or duplicate given rows or columns from a tabular dataset
- filter rows or columns on their properties
- replace or transform table elements
- compute tables of summary statistics across rows or columns

It is even possible to manipulate individual tables or combine multiple ones using pandas/numpy-based custom expressions!
In short, whatever functionality for manipulating tabular data you may have missed in Galaxy is likely provided by this tool,
so give it a try in your next analysis. We are looking forward to your feedback!

Some ideas what you may use the tool for include
- transpose a tabular dataset
- log-transform the data, but add a small offset to zero-values first
- subtract a table from another
- normalize rows or columns

The help section of the tool has many additional concrete examples to get you started.
