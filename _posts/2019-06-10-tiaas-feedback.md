In the spring semester, the Molecular Biology, a three-year PhD programme by the 
[Faculty of Biology in Belgrade](http://bg.ac.rs/en/members/faculties/FB.php)
offered an elective course Genomics. This year 7 students attended this course.

We organized several hands-on sessions on the Galaxy platform. Particularly interesting were new
tutorials on machine learning.
We are thankful to the Galaxy community for developing and maintaining excellent
Training Materials with illustrative use cases. 

The Freiburg Galaxy project team was very helpful in providing the training infrastructure.<br>
Thank you!

Nevena Veljkovic, lecturer Genomics
