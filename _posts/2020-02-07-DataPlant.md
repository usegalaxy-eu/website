title: Galaxy provides support in a NFDI
---

Germany is wants to build a national research data infrastructure [NFDI](https://www.dfg.de/foerderung/programme/nfdi) which can systematically manage scientific and research data, provide long-term data storage, backup and accessibility, and network the data both nationally and internationally. The University of Freiburg applied as lead with the "DataPLANT"  project to connect fundamental plant researchers in Germany and to rovide a suitable infrastructure for data analysis. 

Five representatives from the DataPLANT consortium met in the beginning of December 2019 in Bonn to present and defend the proposal in front of 22 reviewers and DFG members. From our Team, Anika joined to give insights about Galaxy and Training. The other representatives were Dirk von Suchodoletz (RZ, University of Freiburg), Björn Usadel (Forschungszentrum Jülich), Jens Krüger (University of Tübingen), and Timo Mühlhaus (University of Kaiserslautern). Now we received a very positive feedback from the reviewers. So, let's keep fingers crossed.
