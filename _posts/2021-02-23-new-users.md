For all new Galaxy users, we would like to summarize briefly our service.

__With Galaxy we offer you free, automatized analyses of (-omics) data for your lab!__

We would like to invite you to use our free data analysis gateway Galaxy for your daily work. To use Galaxy, you do not need any (bio)informatics skills or to install any software. All you need is a browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

Our Galaxy platform provides >2500 data analysis [tools](https://galaxyproject.eu/tools) for e.g. __sequence analyses, genome annotation, epigenetics, metabolomics, proteomics, metagenomics, statistics and machine learning, and numerous visualizations__.
The Galaxy Europe Team of the University of Freiburg as part of [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de) and [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy) runs the (BMBF funded) European Galaxy Server as one of the biggest public bioinformatics platforms with 10,000 CPU cores and already more than 25,000 users.
