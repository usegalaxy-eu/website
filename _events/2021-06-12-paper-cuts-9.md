The 2021 Galaxy Community Conference is almost here, and that includes the CoFest on July 9-10. In June, the GCC2021 CoFest Organizers are seizing Paper Cuts Day to do planning for the CoFest. GCC2021 CoFest Prep Day will be a virtual, global, day-long event that starts in Australia and follows the sun for the next day. We will have community calls covering the globe.
