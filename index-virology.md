# Galaxy Europe for Virology
{:.no_toc}

Accessible and scalable viral data analysis for everyone

----

# What's this?
{:.no_toc}

The Virology Galaxy workbench is a comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated workflows.
The workbench is based on the Galaxy framework, which guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs,
and sophisticated analyses independent of command-line knowledge.

# Full analysis solutions by viral pathogen

The [Galaxy Project](https://usegalaxy.org){:target="_blank"} virology community has prepared full analysis solutions to support genome sequencing questions around several important human and animal viral pathogens. These solutions come as bundles of analysis workflows, data resources and accompanying training material that will allow researchers to get state-of-the-art and scalable sequencing data analysis for their virus of interest running in the shortest possible amount of time with zero installation effort.

# Primer and primer scheme design

![varVAMP](/assets/media/virologyeu_varvamp_logo.png){:.virology-image-left}

Need to design primers for a simple diagnostic PCR, primers and probe for qPCR, or an entire primer scheme for tiled-amplicon sequencing? We are offering access to [varVAMP](https://virology.usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu%2Frepos%2Fiuc%2Fvarvamp%2Fvarvamp%2F1.2.0%2Bgalaxy0&version=latest) to cover your primer design needs.

A dedicated tutorial about varVAMP and using it together with MAFF-T is coming soon. In the meantime please refer to the excellent [documentation of the tool](https://github.com/jonas-fuchs/varVAMP){:target="_blank"}. You can safely skip the installation instructions because we have taken care of that for you :-)

# Tools, tools, tools

![Word cloud of important virology tools](/assets/media/virologyeu_wordcloud_on_background.png){:.virology-image-left}

Whether you want to do quality control of your sequencing data, map reads to a reference genome, perform de-novo assembly of sequenced reads or lineage-assignment of your viral isolate, we strive to have the best tools available for you through convenient, but full-featured graphical user interfaces, and we offer enough computational resources for these tools to run properly.

Explore the tool panel on the left hand side to learn what's there.

## ... and reference data

We also provide reference data for different viral pathogens to help you get your analyses running faster. These include collections of reference sequences, published primer schemes, different versions of pangolin-data for SARS-CoV-2 lineage assignment, etc., which are listed on the pathogen-specific pages above (see Full analysis solutions).
