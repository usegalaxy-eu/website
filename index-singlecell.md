# Welcome to the Single Cell Omics Lab!
{:.no_toc}


The Single Cell Omics and [The Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org){:target="_blank"} Galaxy enthusiasts have combined forces to bring you a single cell focused Galaxy Lab to make your analysis even easier. This resource is based on the Galaxy framework, which guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses independent of command-line knowledge.

This service is a joint project between different groups from the [Earlham Institute](http://www.earlham.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, the [Gene Expression Team](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/teams/gene-expression/){:target="_blank"} at [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, the [Teichmann Team](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/teichmann-group){:target="_blank"} at the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, [EMBL](https://gbcs.embl.de/){:target="_blank"} the [Sorbonne University](http://artbio.fr/){:target="_blank"}, [Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre](https://www.petermac.org/){:target="_blank"} and the [University of Freiburg](https://galaxyproject.eu/freiburg/){:target="_blank"}.

The server is part if the European Galaxy server and is maintained by the [RNA Bioinformatics Center (RBC)](https://www.denbi.de/network/rna-bioinformatics-center-rbc){:target="_blank"} as part of [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de){:target="_blank"} and [ELIXIR](http://elixir-europe.org){:target="_blank"}.
