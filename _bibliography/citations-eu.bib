 abstract = {Long considered to be a consequence of human antibiotics use by deduction, antibiotic resistance mechanisms appear to be in fact a much older phenomenon as antibiotic resistance genes have previously been detected from millions of year-old permafrost samples. As these specimens guarantee the viability of archaic bacteria, we herein propose to apply the culturomics approach to recover the bacterial content of a Siberian permafrost sample dated, using the in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclide chlorine36 (36Cl), at 2.7 million years to study the dynamics of bacterial evolution in an evolutionary perspective. As a result, we cultured and sequenced the genomes of 28 ancient bacterial species including one new species. To perform genome comparison between permafrost strains and modern isolates we selected 7 of these species (i.e., Achromobacter insolitus, Bacillus idriensis, Brevundimonas aurantiaca, Janibacter melonis, Kocuria rhizophila, Microbacterium hydrocarbonoxydans and Paracoccus yeei). We observed a high level of variability in genomic content with a percentage of shared genes in the core genomes ranging from 21.23\% to 55.59\%. In addition, the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) comparison between permafrost and modern strains for the same species did not allow a dating of ancient strains based on genomic content. There were no significant differences in antibiotic resistance profiles between modern and ancient isolates of each species. Acquired resistance to antibiotics was phenotypically detected in all gram-negative bacterial species recovered from permafrost, with a significant number of genes coding for antibiotic resistance detected. Taken together, these findings confirm previously obtained data that antibiotic resistance predates humanity as most of antimicrobial agents are natural weapons used in inter-microbial conflicts within the biosphere.},

 abstract = {Premise Alkanna tinctoria (Boraginaceae) is an important medicinal herb with its main distribution across the Mediterranean region. To reveal its genetic variation and population structure, microsatellite markers were developed and validated in four Greek populations. Methods and Results RNA-Seq data of the related species Arnebia euchroma and Echium plantagineum were assembled and mined to identify conserved ortholog sets containing simple sequence repeat motifs. Fifty potential loci were identified and then tested on A. tinctoria, of which 17 loci were polymorphic. The number of alleles ranged from one to nine, and the levels of observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.000 to 1.000 and 0.000 to 0.820, respectively. Most of these loci could be successfully amplified in eight other species of Boraginaceae (Alkanna graeca, A. hellenica, A. sfikasiana, Echium vulgare, E. plantagineum, Lithospermum officinale, Borago officinalis, and Anchusa officinalis). Conclusions This study provides the first set of microsatellite loci for studying the genetic variation and population structure of A. tinctoria and shows their potential usefulness in other Boraginaceae species.},

 abstract = {Colistin is a last-resort antimicrobial used for the treatment of human infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However, colistin is still widely used in intensive poultry production in Bangladesh. We aimed to investigate the dynamics and genetic diversity of colistin-resistant commensal Escherichia coli from broiler chickens. A total of 1200 E. coli strains were characterized from 20 broiler farms at three-time points along the production period. All strains were screened for mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes by a multiplex PCR, and their genetic diversity was measured by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR fingerprinting. Genomic diversity and characterization were performed by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Twenty-five percent of the commensal E. coli strains harbored mcr-1 genes. Frequency of mcr-1 gene detection correlated positively (odds ratio 1.71; 95\% CI 0.96–3.06; p = 0.068) with the use of colistin in poultry flocks. REP-PCR profiles and WGS analysis showed diverse E. coli population carrying multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. Phylogenetic comparison of mcr-1-bearing strains recovered from this study with a global strain collection revealed wide phylogenetic relationship. This study identified a high prevalence of mcr-1 gene among genetically diverse E. coli populations from broiler chickens in Bangladesh suggesting a massive horizontal spread of mcr-1 rather than by clonal expansion.},

 abstract = {There is increasing pressure to develop alternative ecotoxicological risk assessment approaches that do not rely on expensive, time-consuming, and ethically questionable live animal testing. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive early life stage toxicity pathway model for the exposure of fish to estrogenic chemicals that is rooted in mechanistic toxicology. Embryo-larval fathead minnows (FHM; Pimephales promelas) were exposed to graded concentrations of 17α-ethinylestradiol (water control, 0.01\% DMSO, 4, 20, and 100 ng/L) for 32 days. Fish were assessed for transcriptomic and proteomic responses at 4 days post-hatch (dph), and for histological and apical end points at 28 dph. Molecular analyses revealed core responses that were indicative of observed apical outcomes, including biological processes resulting in overproduction of vitellogenin and impairment of visual development. Histological observations indicated accumulation of proteinaceous fluid in liver and kidney tissues, energy depletion, and delayed or suppressed gonad development. Additionally, fish in the 100 ng/L treatment group were smaller than controls. Integration of omics data improved the interpretation of perturbations in early life stage FHM, providing evidence of conservation of toxicity pathways across levels of biological organization. Overall, the mechanism-based embryo-larval FHM model showed promise as a replacement for standard adult live animal tests.},

The use of RNA data in gene expression analysis has become increasingly important to gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms behind miRNA–mRNA interactions. As a result, we are confronted with a growing landscape of tools, while standards for reproducibility and benchmarking lag behind. This work identifies the challenges for reproducible RNA analysis, and highlights best practices on the processing and dissemination of scientific results. We found that the success of a tool does not solely depend on its performances: equally important is how a tool is received, and then supported within a community. This leads us to a detailed presentation of the RNA workbench, a community effort for sharing workflows and processing tools, built on top of the Galaxy framework. Here, we follow the community guidelines to extend its portfolio of RNA tools with the integration of the TriplexRNA (https://triplexrna.org). Our findings provide the basis for the development of a recommendation system, to guide users in the choice of tools and workflows.},

@phdthesis{baldwin_evaluating_2019,
 abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate pesticide used extensively in Canada and around the world. Due to its highly conserved mechanism of action involving inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), CPF has the ability to exert toxicity on non-target species in aquatic systems. In fish species, exposure to CPF has been associated with a range of adverse effects across physiological endpoints including abnormal development, inhibition of AChE, immunomodulation, and molecular level effects such as altered expression of specific genes and global transcriptomes. However, the literature on amphibians exposed to CPF is not as extensive despite the known global declines of amphibian species and the hypothesized links between these declines and anthropogenic pesticide contamination of aquatic systems worldwide. The overall objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the sub-lethal effects of CPF exposure on the model amphibian, Xenopus laevis, across levels of biological organization from molecular to whole animal. 
The first study (Chapter 2) examined the molecular toxicity pathways and mechanisms of toxicity after short-term exposure of early life-stage (ELS) X. laevis to CPF using whole body transcriptome analyses. The ELS transcriptomic responses were then compared to apical outcomes of chronic exposure to CPF to determine if identified dysregulated pathways could provide early indicators of these adverse outcomes. Post-hatch individuals were exposed to nominal CPF concentrations of 0.4, 2, or 10 μg L-1. A subset of individuals were sampled at 96 hours (h) for whole-body transcriptomic analysis and remaining individuals were transferred to tanks for long-term exposure through to metamorphic climax ({\textasciitilde} 75 days). Pathway analysis revealed dysregulated pathways that were related to outcomes known to be associated with exposure to CPF such as altered serine hydrolase activity, impacted metabolic processes, and immune-related outcomes. Other dysregulated pathways with less precedence in the literature included vasculature development and sensory perception of light stimulus. Apical outcomes of chronic CPF exposure included inhibition of AChE activity, increased relative liver weight, and a decrease in percentage of individuals that reached metamorphic climax. Dysregulation of serine hydrolase associated pathways after ELS CPF exposure is in agreeance with the decrease in AChE (a serine hydrolase enzyme) activity observed in the brains of individuals at metamorphic climax. Additionally, an increase in relative liver weight after chronic CPF exposure could be related to dysregulation of ELS pathways associated with metabolic processes and immune function. In fact, several pathways related to immune function were depleted.
In Chapter 3, we more closely examined the potential immunotoxicity of sub-lethal CPF exposure. Post-metamorphic individuals were exposed 1 or 10 μg L-1 CPF (nominal) for 7 days (d), then administered a phosphate buffered sodium (PBS) control injection or a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to stimulate an inflammatory response. At 24 h post-injection, morphometric indices were recorded and tissues were sampled for differential leukocyte counts (flow cytometry), liver pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (qPCR), and kidney histopathology. At 1 µg L−1 CPF, there was a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, an increase in circulating granulocytes, and an increase in the granulocyte:lymphocyte (GL) ratio regardless of immune state. Liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and CSF-1 was increased in individuals exposed to 10 µg L−1 CPF, independent of immune state. Exposure to 10 μg L-1 CPF increased kidney epithelial cell height (by 18 \%) and decreased lumen space in the convoluted tubules of the kidney. This study provided evidence that exposure to CPF can lead to changes in key biomarkers of immune status in amphibians in both immune-rested (PBS-injected) and immune-stimulated (LPS-injected) states. Additionally, we found that LPS was an effective mitogen in our study, capable of inducing a robust and measurable stress response in X. laevis. This response included a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, and increase in circulating monocytes, and an increase in the GL ratio. In addition, increased liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and CSF-1 was induced by LPS injection. We conclude that LPS is an appropriate immunostimulatory agent in an immune challenge assay using X. laevis and that exposure to CPF does not appear to impact the response to LPS exposure. 
Overall, our findings show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of CPF has the ability to impact amphibians at multiple levels of biological organization. A number of affected molecular pathways warrant further study in terms of the underlying mechanisms of CPF-mediated toxicity as well as the associated outcomes of CPF exposure in amphibians. This research provides novel data on the effects of CPF exposure to amphibians, which are generally overlooked and under-represented in the literature despite links between pesticide exposure and globally declining amphibian populations.},

 abstract = {The primary problem with the explosion of biomedical datasets is not the data, not computational resources, and not the required storage space, but the general lack of trained and skilled researchers to manipulate and analyze these data. Eliminating this problem requires development of comprehensive educational resources. Here we present a community-driven framework that enables modern, interactive teaching of data analytics in life sciences and facilitates the development of training materials. The key feature of our system is that it is not a static but a continuously improved collection of tutorials. By coupling tutorials with a web-based analysis framework, biomedical researchers can learn by performing computation themselves through a web browser without the need to install software or search for example datasets. Our ultimate goal is to expand the breadth of training materials to include fundamental statistical and data science topics and to precipitate a complete re-engineering of undergraduate and graduate curricula in life sciences. This project is accessible at https://training.galaxyproject.org.},

 abstract = {DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) approved for older AML patients are clinically tested in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). The mechanism of action of these drugs is still under debate. In colon cancer cells, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) can downregulate oncogenes and metabolic genes by reversing gene body DNA methylation, thus implicating gene body methylation as a novel drug target. We asked whether DAC-induced gene body demethylation in AML cells is also associated with gene repression, and whether the latter is enhanced by HDACi. Transcriptome analyses revealed that a combined treatment with DAC and the HDACi panobinostat or valproic acid affected significantly more transcripts than the sum of the genes regulated by either treatment alone, demonstrating a quantitative synergistic effect on genome-wide expression in U937 cells. This effect was particularly striking for downregulated genes. Integrative methylome and transcriptome analyses showed that a massive downregulation of genes, including oncogenes (e.g., MYC) and epigenetic modifiers (e.g., KDM2B, SUV39H1) often overexpressed in cancer, was associated predominantly with gene body DNA demethylation and changes in acH3K9/27. These findings have implications for the mechanism of action of combined epigenetic treatments, and for a better understanding of responses in trials where this approach is clinically tested.},

@article{bohlender_stable_2020,
 abstract = {Recombinantly produced proteins are indispensable tools for medical applications. Since the majority of them are glycoproteins, their N-glycosylation profiles are major determinants for their activity, structural properties and safety. For therapeutical applications, a glycosylation pattern adapted to product and treatment requirements is advantageous. Physcomitrium patens (Physcomitrella, moss) is able to perform highly homogeneous complex-type N-glycosylation. Additionally, it has been glyco-engineered to eliminate plant-specific sugar residues by knock-out of the β1,2-xylosyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase genes (Δxt/ft). Furthermore, Physcomitrella meets wide-ranging biopharmaceutical requirements such as GMP compliance, product safety, scalability and outstanding possibilities for precise genome engineering. However, all plants, in contrast to mammals, lack the capability to perform N-glycan sialylation. Since sialic acids are a common terminal modification on human N glycans, the property to perform N-glycan sialylation is highly desired within the plant-based biopharmaceutical sector. In this study, we present the successful achievement of protein N-glycan sialylation in stably transformed Physcomitrella. The sialylation ability was achieved in a Δxt/ft moss line by stable expression of seven mammalian coding sequences combined with targeted organelle-specific localization of the encoded enzymes responsible for the generation of β1,4 galactosylated acceptor N glycans as well as the synthesis, activation, transport and transfer of sialic acid. Production of free (Neu5Ac) and activated (CMP-Neu5Ac) sialic acid was proven. The glycosidic anchor for the attachment of terminal sialic acid was generated by the introduction of a chimeric human β1,4 galactosyltransferase gene under the simultaneous knock-out of the gene encoding the endogenous β1,3 galactosyltransferase. Functional complex-type N-glycan sialylation was confirmed via mass spectrometric analysis of a stably co-expressed recombinant human protein.},

To compare MACE to standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, four healthy conjunctiva from four subjects were collected during vitreoretinal surgery, halved and immediately transferred to RNA lysis buffer without prior fixation and then processed for either standard RNA-Seq or MACE RNA-Seq analysis. To assess the impact of FFPE preparation on MACE, a third part was fixed in formalin and processed for paraffin embedding, and its transcriptional profile was compared with the unfixed specimens analyzed by MACE. To investigate the impact of FFPE storage time on MACE results, 24 FFPE-treated conjunctival samples from 24 patients were analyzed as well. Nineteen thousand six hundred fifty-nine transcribed genes were detected by both MACE and standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, while 3251 and 2213 transcripts were identified explicitly by MACE or RNA-Seq, respectively. Standard RNA-Seq tended to yield longer detected transcripts more often than MACE technology despite normalization, indicating that the MACE technology is less susceptible to a length bias. FFPE processing revealed negligible effects on MACE sequencing results. Several quality-control measurements showed that long-term storage in paraffin did not decrease the diversity of MACE libraries. We noted a nonlinear relation between storage time and the number of raw reads with an accelerated decrease within the first 1000 days in paraffin, while the numbers remained relatively stable in older samples. Interestingly, the number of transcribed genes detected was independent on FFPE storage time. RNA of sufficient quality and quantity can be extracted from FFPE samples to obtain comprehensive transcriptome profiling using MACE technology. We thus present MACE as a novel opportunity for utilizing FFPE samples stored in histological archives.},

In this study we compare its expression profile to conjunctival papilloma (Pap) and healthy conjunctival tissue (Ctrl) and develop a classification tool to differentiate these entities. Seven conjunctival SCC, seven Pap and ten Ctrl were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and analyzed using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and gene ontology (GO) clusters were explored and the abundance of involved cell types was quantified by xCell. Finally, a classification model was developed to distinguish SCC from Pap and Ctrl. Among the most prominent DEG in SCC a plethora of keratins were upregulated when compared to Pap and Ctrl. xCell analysis revealed an enrichment of immune cells, including activated dendritic cells and T-helper type 1 cells (Th1), in SCC when compared to Ctrl. The generated classification model could reliably discriminate between the three entities according to the expression pattern of 30 factors. This study provides a transcriptome-wide gene expression profile of rare conjunctival SCC. The analysis identifies distinct keratins, as well as dendritic and Th1 cells as important mediators in SCC. Finally, the provided gene expression classifier may become an aid to the conventional histological classification of conjunctival tumors in uncertain cases.},

 abstract = {To decipher the transcriptional signature of macrophages of the human vitreous, also known as hyalocytes, and compare it to the profiles of other myeloid cell populations including human blood-derived monocytes, macrophages and brain microglia. This study involves a total of 13 patients of advanced age with disorders of the vitreoretinal interface undergoing vitrectomy at the University Eye Hospital Freiburg between 2018 and 2019. Vitreal hyalocytes were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and isolated as CD45+CD11b+CX3CR1+Mat-Mac+ cells using a FACS-based sorting protocol. RNA extraction, library preparation and RNA sequencing were performed and the sequencing data was analyzed using the Galaxy web platform. The transcriptome of human hyalocytes was compared to the transcriptional profile of human blood-derived monocytes, macrophages and brain microglia obtained from public databases. Protein validation for selected factors was performed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections from three human donor eyes. On average, 383 ± 233 hyalocytes were isolated per patient, resulting in 128 pg/µl ± 76 pg/µl total RNA per sample. RNA sequencing revealed that SPP1, FTL, CD74 and HLA-DRA are among the most abundantly expressed genes in hyalocytes, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence for CD74, FTL and HLA-DRA. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that biological processes such as “humoral immune response”, “leukocyte migration” and “antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen” (adjusted p \&lt; 0.001) are dominating in vitreal hyalocytes. While the comparison of the gene expression profiles of hyalocytes and other myeloid cell populations showed an overall strong similarity (R2 \&gt; 0.637, p \&lt; 0.001), hyalocytes demonstrated significant differences with respect to common leukocyte-associated factors. In particular, transcripts involved in the immune privilege of the eye, such as POMC, CD46 and CD86, were significantly increased in hyalocytes compared to other myeloid cell subsets. Human hyalocytes represent a unique and distinct innate immune cell population specialized and adapted for the tissue-specific needs in the human vitreous. Vitreal hyalocytes are characterized by a strong expression of genes related to antigen processing and presentation as well as immune modulation. Thus, hyalocytes may represent an underestimated mediator in vitreoretinal disease and for the immune privilege of the eye.},

While many metaproteomic workflows are available, the impact of method choice on results remains unclear. Here, we carried out the first community-driven, multi-lab comparison in metaproteomics: the critical assessment of metaproteome investigation study (CAMPI). Based on well-established workflows, we evaluated the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, lab-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observed that variability at the peptide level was predominantly due to wet-lab workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level differences largely disappeared at protein group level. While differences were observed for predicted community composition, similar functional profiles were obtained across workflows. CAMPI demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics research, serves as a template for multi-lab studies in metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for benchmarking future developments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Genome-wide transcription analysis of Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 cerebella using microarrays revealed changes in genes that function in cell cycle, cell migration, axon guidance, and metabolism. To identify direct DOT1L target genes, we used genome-wide profiling of H3K79me2 and transcriptional analysis. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DR) and differentially expressed genes (DE) revealed in total 12 putative DOT1L target genes in Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 affecting signaling (Tnfaip8l3, B3galt5), transcription (Otx1), cell migration and axon guidance (Sema4a, Sema5a, Robo1), cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Lss, Cyp51), cell cycle (Cdkn1a), calcium-dependent cell-adhesion or exocytosis (Pcdh17, Cadps2), and unknown function (Fam174b). Dysregulated expression of these target genes might be implicated in the ataxia phenotype observed in Dot1l-cKOAtoh1.},

 abstract = {Chromatin properties are regulated by complex networks of epigenome modifications. Currently, it is unclear how these modifications interact and if they control downstream effects such as gene expression. We employed promiscuous chromatin binding of a zinc finger fused catalytic domain of DNMT3A to introduce DNA methylation in HEK293 cells at many CpG islands (CGIs) and systematically investigated the dynamics of the introduced DNA methylation and the consequent changes of the epigenome network. We observed efficient methylation at thousands of CGIs, but it was unstable at about 90\% of them, highlighting the power of genome-wide molecular processes that protect CGIs against DNA methylation. Partially stable methylation was observed at about 1000 CGIs, which showed enrichment in H3K27me3. Globally, the introduced DNA methylation strongly correlated with a decrease in gene expression indicating a direct effect. Similarly, global but transient reductions in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac were observed after DNA methylation but no changes were found for H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. Our data provide a global and time-resolved view on the network of epigenome modifications, their connections with DNA methylation and the responses triggered by artificial DNA methylation revealing a direct repressive effect of DNA methylation in CGIs on H3K4me3, histone acetylation, and gene expression.},

@article{brunet_mass_2019,
 abstract = {Genome annotation is central to today's proteomic research as it draws the outlines of the proteomic landscape. Traditional models of open reading frame (ORF) annotation impose two arbitrary criteria: a minimum length of 100 codons and a single ORF per transcript. However, a growing number of studies report expression of proteins from allegedly non-coding regions, challenging the accuracy of current genome annotations. These novel proteins were found encoded either within non-coding RNAs, 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, or overlapping a known coding sequence (CDS) in an alternative ORF. OpenProt is the first database that enforces a polycistronic model for eukaryotic genomes, allowing annotation of multiple ORFs per transcript. OpenProt is freely accessible and offers custom downloads of protein sequences across 10 species. Using OpenProt database for proteomic experiments enables novel proteins discovery and highlights the polycistronic nature of eukaryotic genes. The size of OpenProt database (all predicted proteins) is substantial and need be taken in account for the analysis. However, with appropriate false discovery rate (FDR) settings or the use of a restricted OpenProt database, users will gain a more realistic view of the proteomic landscape. Overall, OpenProt is a freely available tool that will foster proteomic discoveries.},

This strain A2879T was isolated from an abscess swab of a patient sampled during routine care at hospital. Phylogenetic analyses (full-­length 16S rRNA gene and whole-­genome sequence) revealed the strain to belong to the genus Prevotella, but to be distant from recognized species, with the closest relationship to Prevotella veroralis. Unambiguous identification also proved possible by MALDI-­TOF MS. The genomic DNA G+C content was 41.5 mol\%. Strain A2879T was moderately saccharolytic and proteolytic. The most abundant cellular long-­chain fatty acids were anteiso-C­ 15 : 0 and iso-C­ 15 : 0. In view of these data, strain A2879T is considered to represent a novel species within the genus Prevotella, for which the name Prevotella vespertina sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A2879T (=DSM 108027T=CCOS 1233T=CCUG72808T). As this strain has been isolated from a clinical sample, it is considered relevant for human medicine and health in general, and in particular for the fields of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases. This description will enable routine and research laboratories alike to easily identify the novel taxon, allowing its role in the context of human health and disease or microbiota to be further elucidated.},

This study provides a detailed description of Pectobacterium phage CB7 (vB\_PatM\_CB7), which specifically infects P. atrosepticum. Host range, morphology, latent period, burst size and stability at different conditions of temperature and pH were examined. Analysis of its genome (142.8 kbp) shows that the phage forms a new species of Certrevirus, sharing sequence similarity with other members, highlighting conservation within the genus. Conserved elements include a putative early promoter like that of the Escherichia coli sigma70 promoter, which was found to be shared with other genus members. A number of dissimilarities were observed, relating to DNA methylation and nucleotide metabolism. Some members do not have homologues of a cytosine methylase and anaerobic nucleotide reductase subunits NrdD and NrdG, respectively. Furthermore, the genome of CB7 contains one of the largest numbers of homing endonucleases described in a single phage genome in the literature to date, with a total of 23 belonging to the HNH and LAGLIDADG families. Analysis by RT-PCR of the HNH homing endonuclease residing within introns of genes for the large terminase, DNA polymerase, ribonucleotide reductase subunits NrdA and NrdB show that they are splicing competent. Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was also performed on the virion of CB7, allowing the identification of 26 structural proteins\&mdash;20 of which were found to be shared with the type phages of the genera of Vequintavirus and Seunavirus. The results of this study provide greater insights into the phages of the Certrevirus genus as well as the subfamily Vequintavirinae.},

@misc{camargo_romera_isoform_2021,
 abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequent extracranial solid tumour in childhood. The clinical diagnosis of NB is difficult due to the age of the patient and the vague appearance of the symptoms. Moreover, there are two groups of aggressive NBs, one with MYCN amplification and the other with an 11q deletion. Some genes could be a candidate suppressor for NB, e.g., the DLG2 gene that resides within the 11q-deleted region. The DLG2 gene has a large number of exons and multiple isoforms depending on the alternative splicing process. Moreover, these isoforms can include the L27 domain or not. This study aimed to analyse, by applying bioinformatic tools, if isoform 2, which does not have L27 domain, could be a candidate suppressor for this disease. RNA-seq samples from different human cell lines were collected from NCBI and a quality analysis was performed. The filtered samples were run in R and Python programs to do a visualization of the exon expression level and the prediction of Rsubread for exon-exon junctions. The results showed that isoform 2 of DLG2 gene was not expressed in the samples of NB, which is a promising result for being a candidate suppressor of NB. Furthermore, the prediction of exon-exon junctions by Rsubread was confirmed to be very accurate. In conclusion, this study shows that isoform 2 of DLG2 gene could be a candidate tumour suppressor in NB that could, in the future, be used as a target to help to detect earlier the presence of NB and increase the life expectancy of children who suffer from this disease.},

@phdthesis{cantarella_insights_2020,
 abstract = {A large portion of the human genome is composed of repeated sequences, with Alu retrotransposons representing the most abundant repetitive elements. Alu sequences belong to the class of the Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) and depend on the Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) for their mobilization into the genome. The efficiency of Alu amplification during primate evolution suggests a positive driving force for their accumulation, bringing up to 1 million copies in the human genome. For unclear reasons, the majority of Alu sequences is repressed by tight epigenetic silencing, which is released in response to cell stresses such as virus infection and cancer progression. Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is known to cause an increase of Alu transcription in HeLa, myelogenous leukemia and embryonic kidney cell lines, even though the virus factors that are responsible for this transcriptional enhancement have not been identified yet. Potential candidates could be represented by oncovirus proteins that induce a global remodeling of the host epigenetic landscape. For example, the Adenovirus early E1A protein interacts with the host tumor suppressor Rb, the lysine acetylase p300 and the p400 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, resulting in the induction of quiescent fibroblasts to enter the S-phase of the cell cycle. 
The exceptional success of Alu expansion and their retention even at the cost of a strong epigenetic silencing, which is released by virus infection, led us to investigate the molecular mechanism of Alus activation and their potential involvement in various cell processes.  
Firstly, genome-wide Alu profiling was performed in quiescent human primary fibroblasts infected with the Ad5 dl1500 mutant, which only expresses the oncovirus small E1A protein. A total of 1880 Polymerase III (Pol III) transcribed Alus were detected through high throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), revealing a 4-fold increase of the average Alu expression induced by small E1A.   
With the aim of identifying small E1A-host protein interactions that are crucial for the activation of Alu expression, the host proteins Rb, p300 and p400 were put under investigation. Alu expression profiling was performed in cells infected with small E1A mutants that are not capable to bind Rb, p300 or p400. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data revealed that the small E1A-p400 binding mutant was the least efficient in activating Alu expression, whereas a milder effect was reported for small E1A-Rb and small E1A-p300 binding mutants. Moreover, ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of dl1500 infected fibroblasts revealed an enrichment of H3K4me1 within the body of small E1A-induced Alus. Our data point toward the existence of H3K4me1 Alu loci that are recognized by p400 bound by small E1A, resulting in Alu transcription in response to virus infection. 
Secondly, two Alu sequences were stably overexpressed in one primary and one cancer cell line (human fibroblasts and HeLa cells, respectively) and differential gene expression in Alu-overexpressing cells was performed through RNA-seq data analysis. Among the two Alu- overexpressing fibroblast cell lines, 330 genes were detected as Differentially Expressed (DE), whereas only two genes were differentially expressed in HeLa cells. Interestingly, DE genes detected in Alu-overexpressing fibroblasts were significantly enriched in pathways belonging to cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. The promotion of cell cycle was also supported by a significantly higher percentage of cells in the S-phase compared to control samples as revealed by flow cytometry.  
The studies conducted in this work identify Ad5 small E1A as one of the virus factors that enhance Alu transcription, possibly through binding with the p400 complex. Interestingly, the overexpression of two Alu sequences in human fibroblasts leads to the stimulation of cell cycle progression, resulting in the same phenotype as previously observed in Ad5 infected fibroblasts. This brings us to speculate that the overexpression of Alu sequences during stress response to viral infection could be exploited by Ad5 to sustain cell proliferation.},

@article{cermak_unexpected_2020,
 abstract = {In plants, posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is induced by small RNAs (sRNAs) generated from various dsRNA precursors. To assess the impact of dsRNA origin, we compared downregulation of GFP expression triggered by inverted repeat (IR), antisense (AS) and unterminated sense (UT) transcripts transiently expressed from the estradiol-inducible promoter. The use of homogeneously responding tobacco BY-2 cell lines allowed monitoring the onset of silencing and its reversibility. In this system, IR induced the strongest and fastest silencing accompanied by dense DNA methylation. At low induction, silencing in individual cells was binary (either strong or missing), suggesting that a certain threshold sRNA level had to be exceeded. The AS variant specifically showed a deviated sRNA-strand ratio shifted in favor of antisense orientation. In AS lines and weakly induced IR lines, only the silencer DNA was methylated, but the same target GFP sequence was not, showing that DNA methylation accompanying PTGS was influenced both by the level and origin of sRNAs, and possibly also by the epigenetic state of the locus. UT silencing appeared to be the least effective and resembled classical sense PTGS. The best responding UT lines behaved relatively heterogeneously possibly due to complexly arranged T-DNA insertions. Unlike IR and AS variants that fully restored GFP expression upon removal of the inducer, only partial reactivation was observed in some UT lines. Our results pointed out several not yet described phenomena and differences between the long-known silencer variants that may direct further research and affect selection of proper silencer variants for specific applications.},

 abstract = {Various next generation sequencing (NGS) based strategies have been successfully used in the recent past for tracing origins and understanding the evolution of infectious agents, investigating the spread and transmission chains of outbreaks, as well as facilitating the development of effective and rapid molecular diagnostic tests and contributing to the hunt for treatments and vaccines. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses one of the greatest global threats in modern history and has already caused severe social and economic costs. The development of efficient and rapid sequencing methods to reconstruct the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been fundamental for the design of diagnostic molecular tests and to devise effective measures and strategies to mitigate the diffusion of the pandemic.Diverse approaches and sequencing methods can, as testified by the number of available sequences, be applied to SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, each technology and sequencing approach has its own advantages and limitations. In the current review, we will provide a brief, but hopefully comprehensive, account of currently available platforms and methodological approaches for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We also present an outline of current repositories and databases that provide access to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and associated metadata. Finally, we offer general advice and guidelines for the appropriate sharing and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 data and metadata, and suggest that more efficient and standardized integration of current and future SARS-CoV-2-related data would greatly facilitate the struggle against this new pathogen. We hope that our ‘vademecum’ for the production and handling of SARS-CoV-2-related sequencing data, will contribute to this objective.},

@article{dad_molecular_2020,
 abstract = {Recent studies support the assumption that mutation of the X-linked Pig-a gene is most likely responsible for the mutant phenotype of the cells deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins quantified in the rodent Pig-a gene mutation assay. In humans, however, mutations in both alleles of one of the 30 other genes involved in GPI-anchor synthesis, e.g., PIG-L and PIG-O, cause reduced expression of surface GPI-anchored proteins. Here, we investigated the possibility that the loss of the GPI-anchor detected by the rat Pig-a assay also could be caused by mutation in other GPI-biosynthesis genes. 31 samples were obtained from 8 inbred and outbred rat strains commonly used for genetic toxicology assays. In order to investigate possible sources of variation in the Pig-a assay, variant DNA sequences were evaluated in Cd59 and 24 GPI-biosynthesis genes. In some genes, such as Pig-n and Pig-u, homozygous variations occurred in all animals, suggesting that these variations are due to deviations in the reference genome. Heterozygous Pig-s, Pig-w, Pig-o, Pig-c, Pgap1, Pgap2, Pig-k and Pig-t variations were found, however, indicating that these genes could serve as targets for mutation in the assay. Protein alignment for these altered genes was conducted with possible human, mouse and rat phenotypic mutants from the literature; this analysis demonstrated that many of the variations that we detected were in non-conserved sequences and that no phenotypes for any of these variants could be inferred from known mutants from the literature. All heterozygous variants were in outbred rats. Overall, the findings of this study cannot totally rule out the possibility that mutations in GPI-biosynthesis genes other than Pig-a are detected in the Pig-a assay, but suggest that if it occurs, it must occur only rarely and therefore mutations in genes other than Pig-a have little impact on rat-based experiments.},

@article{darkow_small_2021,
 abstract = {In search of more efficacious and safe pharmacological treatments for atrial fibrillation (AF), atria-selective antiarrhythmic agents have been promoted that target ion channels principally expressed in the atria. This concept allows one to engage antiarrhythmic effects in atria, but spares the ventricles from potentially proarrhythmic side effects. It has been suggested that cardiac small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels may represent an atria-selective target in mammals including humans. However, there are conflicting data concerning the expression of SK channels in different stages of AF, and recent findings suggest that SK channels are upregulated in ventricular myocardium when patients develop heart failure. To address this issue, RNA-sequencing was performed to compare expression levels of three SK channels (KCNN1, KCNN2, and KCNN3) in human atrial and ventricular tissue samples from transplant donor hearts (no cardiac disease), and patients with cardiac disease in sinus rhythm or with AF. In addition, for control purposes expression levels of several genes known to be either chamber-selective or differentially expressed in AF and heart failure were determined. In atria, as compared to ventricle from transplant donor hearts, we confirmed higher expression of KCNN1 and KCNA5, and lower expression of KCNJ2, whereas KCNN2 and KCNN3 were statistically not differentially expressed. Overall expression of KCNN1 was low compared to KCNN2 and KCNN3. Comparing atrial tissue from patients with AF to sinus rhythm samples we saw downregulation of KCNN2 in AF, as previously reported. When comparing ventricular tissue from heart failure patients to non-diseased samples, we found significantly increased ventricular expression of KCNN3 in heart failure, as previously published. The other channels showed no significant difference in expression in either disease. Our results add weight to the view that SK channels are not likely to be an atria-selective target, especially in failing human hearts, and modulators of these channels may prove to have less utility in treating AF than hoped. Whether targeting SK1 holds potential remains to be elucidated.},

This white paper presents a roadmap for future e-infrastructure developments in the field of IDP research within the ELIXIR framework. The goal of these developments is to drive the creation of high-quality tools and resources to support the identification, analysis and functional characterisation of IDPs. The roadmap is the result of a workshop titled “An intrinsically disordered protein user community proposal for ELIXIR” held at the University of Padua. The workshop, and further consultation with the members of the wider IDP community, identified the key priority areas for the roadmap including the development of standards for data annotation, storage and dissemination; integration of IDP data into the ELIXIR Core Data Resources; and the creation of benchmarking criteria for IDP-related software. Here, we discuss these areas of priority, how they can be implemented in cooperation with the ELIXIR platforms, and their connections to existing ELIXIR Communities and international consortia. The article provides a preliminary blueprint for an IDP Community in ELIXIR and is an appeal to identify and involve new stakeholders.},

 abstract = {Endothelial cells take pivotal roles in the heart and the vascular system and their differentiation, subspecification and function is determined by gene expression. A stable, in vitro cardiac endothelial cell line could provide high cell numbers as needed for many epigenetic analyses and facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial cell biology. To test their suitability for transcriptomic or epigenetic studies, we compared the transcriptome of cultured immortalized mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) to primary cardiac endothelial cells (pEC). Whole transcriptome comparison of MCEC and pEC showed a correlation of 0.75–0.77. Interestingly, correlation of gene expression declined in endothelial cell-typical genes. In MCEC, we found a broad downregulation of genes that are highly expressed in pEC, including well-described markers of endothelial cell differentiation. Accordingly, systematic analysis revealed a downregulation of genes associated with typical endothelial cell functions in MCEC, while genes related to mitotic cell cycle were upregulated when compared to pEC. In conclusion, the findings from this study suggest that primary cardiac endothelial cells should preferably be used for genome-wide transcriptome or epigenome studies. The suitability of in vitro cell lines for experiments investigating single genes or signaling pathways should be carefully validated before use.},

Nonstop mutations have been characterized in hereditary diseases, but not in cancer genetics. In a pan-cancer analysis, we curated and analysed 3,412 nonstop mutations from 62 tumour entities, generating a comprehensive database at http://NonStopDB.dkfz.de. Six different nonstop extension mutations affected the tumour suppressor SMAD4, extending its carboxy terminus by 40 amino acids. These caused rapid degradation of the SMAD4 mutants via the ubiquitin–proteasome system. A hydrophobic degron signal sequence of ten amino acids within the carboxy-terminal extension was required to induce complete loss of the SMAD4 protein. Thus, we discovered that nonstop mutations can be functionally important in cancer and characterize their loss-of-function impact on the tumour suppressor SMAD4.},

 abstract = {DNA methylation has been identified among putative regulatory mechanisms for CYP11B2 expression in primary aldosteronism.The objective of this work is to investigate DNA methylation and expression of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes in benign adrenocortical tumors.This cross-sectional study took place at university hospitals.We collected fresh-frozen tissues from patients with benign adrenocortical adenomas (n = 48) (nonfunctioning n = 9, autonomous cortisol secretion n = 9, Cushing syndrome n = 17, aldosterone-producing [APA] n = 13) and adrenal cortex adjacent to APA (n = 12). We collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of paired APA and concurrent aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCCs) (n = 6).DNA methylation levels were evaluated by quantitative bisulfite next-generation sequencing in fresh-frozen tissues (CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17A1, CYP21A2, HSD3B1, HSD3B2, NR5A1, STAR, and TSPO) and FFPE APA/APCC paired samples (CYP11B2). CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17, CYP21, and STAR gene expressions were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.The main outcome measure was DNA methylation.CYP11B2 methylation levels were significantly lower in APA than in other adrenal tissues (P \&lt; .001). Methylation levels of the remaining genes were comparable among groups. Overall, CYP11B2 expression and DNA methylation were negatively correlated (ρ = –0.379; P = .003). In FFPE-paired APA/APCC samples, CYP11B2 methylation level was significantly lower in APA than in concurrent APCCs (P = .028).DNA methylation plays a regulatory role for CYP11B2 expression and may contribute to aldosterone hypersecretion in APA. Lower CYP11B2 methylation levels in APA than in APCCs may suggest an APCC-to-APA switch via progressive CYP11B2 demethylation. Conversely, DNA methylation seems not to be relevant in regulating the expression of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes other than CYP11B2.},

 abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the major causes of cancer-associated deaths worldwide, with a dismal prognosis that has not significantly changed over the last decades. Transcriptional analysis has provided valuable insights into pancreatic tumorigenesis. Specifically, pancreatic cancer subtypes were identified, characterized by specific mutations and gene expression changes associated with differences in patient survival. In addition to differentially regulated mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were shown to have subtype-specific expression patterns. Hence, we aimed to characterize prognostic lncRNAs with deregulated expression in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which has the worst prognosis. Extensive in silico analyses followed by in vitro experiments identified long intergenic non-coding RNA 261 (LINC00261) as a downregulated lncRNA in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which is generally associated with transforming growth factor \&beta; (TGF\&beta;) signaling in human cancer cells. Its genomic neighbor, the transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), regulated LINC00261 expression by direct binding of the LINC00261 promoter. CRISPR-mediated knockdown and promoter knockout validated the importance of LINC00261 in TGF\&beta;-mediated epithelial\&ndash;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and established the epithelial marker E-cadherin, an important cell adhesion protein, as a downstream target of LINC00261. Consequently, depletion of LINC00261 enhanced motility and invasiveness of PANC-1 cells in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that LINC00261 is an important tumor-suppressive lncRNA in PDAC that is involved in maintaining a pro-epithelial state associated with favorable disease outcome.},

Hydration is the key trigger to initiate germination, but the mechanism by which seeds sense water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates upon hydration and allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that biophysical states of FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo in suppressing seed germination under unfavorable environments. We find intragenic, intraspecific, and interspecific natural variation in FLOE1 expression and phase separation and show that intragenic variation is associated with adaptive germination strategies in natural populations. This combination of molecular, organismal, and ecological studies uncovers FLOE1 as a tunable environmental sensor with direct implications for the design of drought-resistant crops, in the face of climate change.},

One approach relies on the definition of families, which can be encoded as covariance models (CMs) or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). While being powerful tools, their complexity makes it tedious to investigate them in their (default) tabulated form. This specifically applies to the interpretation of comparisons between multiple models as in family clans. The Covariance model visualization tools (CMV) visualize CMs or HMMs to: I) Obtain an easily interpretable representation of HMMs and CMs; II) Put them in context with the structural sequence alignments they have been created from; III) Investigate results of model comparisons and highlight regions of interest.AvailabilitySource code (http://www.github.com/eggzilla/cmv), web-service (http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CMVS) Contactegg@informatik.uni-freiburg.de, choener@bioinf.uni-leipzig.deSupplementary informationSupplementary data available online.},

 abstract = {The aerial surfaces of plants harbour diverse communities of microorganisms. The rising awareness concerning the potential roles of these phyllosphere microbiota for airborne pollutant remediation and plant growth promotion, advocates for a better understanding of their community structure and dynamics in urban ecosystems. Here, we characterised the epiphytic microbial communities on leaves of Platanus x hispanica trees in the city centre of Hasselt (Belgium), and the nearby forest area of Bokrijk, Genk (Belgium). We compared the influences of season, site, and air pollutants concentration variations on the tree’s phyllosphere microbiome by determining the intra- and inter-individual variation in leaf bacterial communities. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed large variation in the bacterial community structure and diversity throughout the years but also allowed to discriminate an environment effect on community assembly. Partial drivers for this environment effect on composition can be correlated with the huge differences in ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) and black carbon on the leaves. A change in bacterial community composition was noted for trees growing in the city centre compared to the natural site, and also more human-associated genera were found colonising the leaves from the city centre. These integrated results offer an original and first insight in the Platanus phyllomicrobiota, which can offer new opportunities to use phyllosphere microorganisms to enhance air pollution degradation.},

@article{espindola-hernandez_genomic_2020,
 abstract = {Owls (Strigiformes) evolved speciﬁc adaptations to their nocturnal predatory lifestyle, such as asymmetrical ears, a facial disk, and a feather structure allowing silent ﬂight. Owls also share some traits with diurnal raptors and other nocturnal birds, such as cryptic plumage patterns, reversed sexual size dimorphism, and acute vision and hearing. The genetic basis of some of these adaptations to a nocturnal predatory lifestyle has been studied by candidate gene approaches but rarely with genome-wide scans. Here, we used a genome-wide comparative analysis to test for selection in the early history of the owls. We estimated the substitution rates in the coding regions of 20 bird genomes, including 11 owls of which ﬁve were newly sequenced. Then, we tested for functional overrepresentation across the genes that showed signals of selection. In the ancestral branch of the owls, we found traces of positive selection in the evolution of genes functionally related to visual perception, especially to phototransduction, and to chromosome packaging. Several genes that have been previously linked to acoustic perception, circadian rhythm, and feather structure also showed signals of an accelerated evolution in the origin of the owls. We discuss the functions of the genes under positive selection and their putative association with the adaptation to the nocturnal predatory lifestyle of the owls.},

@article{estrada_mallarino_nephronophthisis_2020,
 abstract = {Mutations of cilia-associated molecules cause multiple developmental defects that are collectively termed ciliopathies. However, several ciliary proteins, involved in gating access to the cilium, also assume localizations at other cellular sites including the nucleus, where they participate in DNA damage responses to maintain tissue integrity. Molecular insight into how these molecules execute such diverse functions remains limited. A mass spectrometry screen for ANKS6-interacting proteins suggested an involvement of ANKS6 in RNA processing and/or binding. Comparing the RNA-binding properties of the known RNA-binding protein BICC1 with the three ankyrin-repeat proteins ANKS3, ANKS6 (NPHP16) and INVERSIN (NPHP2) confirmed that certain nephronophthisis (NPH) family members can interact with RNA molecules. We also observed that BICC1 and INVERSIN associate with stress granules in response to translational inhibition. Furthermore, BICC1 recruits ANKS3 and ANKS6 into TIA-1-positive stress granules after exposure to hippuristanol. Our findings uncover a novel function of NPH family members, and provide further evidence that NPH family members together with BICC1 are involved in stress responses to maintain tissue and organ integrity.},

 abstract = {Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the most commonly used technique in explorative proteomic research. A variety of open-source tools for peptide-spectrum matching have become available. Most analyses of explorative MS data are performed using conventional settings, such as fully specific enzymatic constraints. Here we evaluated the impact of the fragment mass tolerance in combination with the enzymatic constraints on the performance of three search engines. Three open-source search engines (Myrimatch, X! Tandem, and MSGF+) were evaluated concerning the suitability in semi- and unspecific searches as well as the importance of accurate fragment mass spectra in non-specific peptide searches. We then performed a semispecific reanalysis of the published NCI-60 deep proteome data applying the most suited parameters. Semi- and unspecific LC-MS/MS data analyses particularly benefit from accurate fragment mass spectra while this effect is less pronounced for conventional, fully specific peptide-spectrum matching. Search speed differed notably between the three search engines for semi- and non-specific peptide-spectrum matching. Semispecific reanalysis of NCI-60 proteome data revealed hundreds of previously undescribed N-terminal peptides, including cases of proteolytic processing or likely alternative translation start sites, some of which were ubiquitously present in all cell lines of the reanalyzed panel. Highly accurate MS2 fragment data in combination with modern open-source search algorithms enable the confident identification of semispecific peptides from large proteomic datasets. The identification of previously undescribed N-terminal peptides in published studies highlights the potential of future reanalysis and data mining in proteomic datasets.},

 abstract = {The large family of KRAB zinc finger (KZNF) genes are transcription factors implicated in recognizing and repressing repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs) in our genome. Through successive waves of retrotransposition-mediated insertions, various classes of TEs have invaded mammalian genomes at multiple timepoints throughout evolution. Even though most of the TE classes in our genome lost the capability to retrotranspose millions of years ago, it remains elusive why the KZNFs that evolved to repress them are still retained in our genome. One hypothesis is that KZNFs become repurposed for other regulatory roles. Here, we find evidence that evolutionary changes in KZNFs provide them not only with the ability to repress TEs, but also to bind to gene promoters independent of TEs. Using KZNF binding site data in conjunction with gene expression values from the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that KZNFs have the ability to regulate gene expression in the human brain in a region-specific manner. Our analysis shows that the expression of KZNFs shows correlation with the expression of their target genes, suggesting that KZNFs have a direct influence on gene expression in the developing human brain. The extent of this regulation and the impact it has on primate brain evolution are still to be determined, but our results imply that KZNFs have become widely integrated into neuronal gene regulatory networks. Our analysis predicts that gene expression networks have been repeatedly innovated throughout primate evolution, continuously gaining new layers of gene regulation mediated by both TEs and KZNFs in our genome.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Crossroads between transposons and gene regulation’.},

While work on ZEB1 has mainly focused on its role as a transcriptional repressor, it can also act as a transcriptional activator. To further understand these two modes of action, we performed a genome-wide ZEB1 binding study in triple-negative breast cancer cells. We identified ZEB1 as a novel interactor of the AP-1 factors FOSL1 and JUN and show that, together with the Hippo pathway effector YAP, they form a transactivation complex, predominantly activating tumour-promoting genes, thereby synergising with its function as a repressor of epithelial genes. High expression of ZEB1, YAP, FOSL1 and JUN marks the aggressive claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, indicating the translational relevance of our findings. Thus, our results link critical tumour-promoting transcription factors: ZEB1, AP-1 and Hippo pathway factors. Disturbing their molecular interaction may provide a promising treatment option for aggressive cancer types.},

 abstract = {Background Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) derives spatial molecular distribution maps directly from clinical tissue specimens. This allows for spatial characterization of molecular compositions of different tissue types and tumor subtypes, which bears great potential for assisting pathologists with diagnostic decisions or personalized treatments. Unfortunately, progress in translational MSI is often hindered by insufficient quality control and lack of reproducible data analysis. Raw data and analysis scripts are rarely publicly shared. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Galaxy MSI tool set for the reproducible analysis of an urothelial carcinoma dataset.
Methods Tryptic peptides were imaged in a cohort of 39 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human urothelial cancer tissue cores with a MALDI-TOF/TOF device. The complete data analysis was performed in a fully transparent and reproducible manner on the European Galaxy Server. Annotations of tumor and stroma were performed by a pathologist and transferred to the MSI data to allow for supervised classifications of tumor vs. stroma tissue areas as well as for muscle-infiltrating and non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas. For putative peptide identifications, m/z features were matched to the MSiMass list.
Results Rigorous quality control in combination with careful pre-processing enabled reduction of m/z shifts and intensity batch effects. High classification accuracy was found for both, tumor vs. stroma and muscle-infiltrating vs. non-muscle invasive tumors. Some of the most discriminative m/z features for each condition could be assigned a putative identity: Stromal tissue was characterized by collagen type I peptides and tumor tissue by histone and heat shock protein beta-1 peptides.Intermediate filaments such as cytokeratins and vimentin were discriminative between the tumors with different muscle-infiltration status. To make the study fully reproducible and to advocate the criteria of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) research data, we share the raw data, spectra annotations as well as all Galaxy histories and workflows. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026459 and Galaxy results via https://github.com/foellmelanie/Bladder\_MSI\_Manuscript\_Galaxy\_links.
Conclusion Here, we show that translational MSI data analysis in a fully transparent and reproducible manner is possible and we would like to encourage the community to join our efforts.},

Key determinants of successful library preparation are the available amount of input DNA and the efficiency of the conversion of this DNA into functional library molecules. While the standard blunt-end ligation protocol for Ion Torrent libraries has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 25\%, Y-adapters enable highly efficient library preparation by (i) sticky-end ligation and (ii) rendering both DNA strands functional for sequencing, hence resulting in a theoretical efficiency of up to 100\%. Moreover, the generation of adapter dimers is reduced. Therefore, we designed, optimized and validated Y-adapters compatible with Ion Torrent sequencing.

@article{foschini_methylation_2020,
 abstract = {Background: Androgen Receptor (AR) has been described to play a prominent role in Male Breast Cancer (MBC). It maps on chromosome X, and recent reports indicate that X chromosome polysomy is frequent in MBC. Since the response to anti-androgen therapy may depend on AR polysomy and on its overexpression similarly to prostate cancer, aim of the present study was to investigate the DNA methylation level of AR and its coregulators, especially those mapped on the X chromosome, that may influence the activity of AR in MBC. Methods: The DNA methylation level of AR, MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC1, MAGEC2, FLNA, HDAC6, and UXT, mapped on the X chromosome, was evaluated by quantitative Bisulfite-NGS. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in a GalaxyProject environment using BWA-METH, MethylDackel, and Methylation Plotter tools. The study population consisted of MBC (41 cases) compared with gynecomastia (15 cases). Results: MAGEA family members, especially MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC, and UXT and HDAC6 showed hypomethylation of several CpGs, reaching statistical significance by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p{\textless}0.01) in MBC when compared to gynecomastia. AR showed almost no methylation at all. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that MAGEA family members mapped on X chromosome and coregulators of AR, are hypomethylated in male IDC. This may lead to their overexpression, enhancing AR activity, while AR itself shows very little methylation.},

@article{friedrich_tryptophan_2021,
 abstract = {The dynamics and phenotypes of intratumoral myeloid cells during tumor progression are poorly understood. Here we define myeloid cellular states in gliomas by longitudinal single-cell profiling and demonstrate their strict control by the tumor genotype: in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant tumors, differentiation of infiltrating myeloid cells is blocked, resulting in an immature phenotype. In late-stage gliomas, monocyte-derived macrophages drive tolerogenic alignment of the microenvironment, thus preventing T cell response. We define the IDH-dependent tumor education of infiltrating macrophages to be causally related to a complex re-orchestration of tryptophan metabolism, resulting in activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. We further show that the altered metabolism of IDH-mutant gliomas maintains this axis in bystander cells and that pharmacological inhibition of tryptophan metabolism can reverse immunosuppression. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a glioma genotype-dependent intratumoral network of resident and recruited myeloid cells and identify tryptophan metabolism as a target for immunotherapy of IDH-mutant tumors.},

Among various known virus-control strategies, RNAi-mediated defence has shown the potential to protect plants against various pathogens including viral infections. Micro(mi)RNAs play a major role in RNAi-mediated defence. Methods Using in silico analyses, we investigated the possibility of tomato-encoded miRNAs (TomiRNA) to target PhCMoV and ToBRFV genomes using five different algorithms, i.e., miRanda, RNAhybrid, RNA22, Tapirhybrid and psRNATarget. Results The results revealed that 14 loci on PhCMoV and 10 loci on ToBRFV can be targeted by the TomiRNAs based on the prediction of at least three algorithms. Interestingly, one TomiRNA, miR6026, can target open reading frames from both viruses, i.e., the phosphoprotein encoding gene of PhCMoV, and the two replicase components of ToBRFV. There are currently no commercially available PhCMoV- or ToBRFV-resistant tomato varieties, therefore the predicted data provide useful information for the development of PhCMoV- and ToBFRV-resistant tomato plants.},

@article{gao_comprehensive_2020,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Mammalian DNA methylation patterns are established by two \textit{de novo} DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which exhibit both redundant and distinctive methylation activities. However, the related molecular basis remains undetermined. Through comprehensive structural, enzymology and cellular characterization of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, we here report a multi-layered substrate-recognition mechanism underpinning their divergent genomic methylation activities. A hydrogen bond in the catalytic loop of DNMT3B causes a lower CpG specificity than DNMT3A, while the interplay of target recognition domain and homodimeric interface fine-tunes the distinct target selection between the two enzymes, with Lysine 777 of DNMT3B acting as a unique sensor of the +1 flanking base. The divergent substrate preference between DNMT3A and DNMT3B provides an explanation for site-specific epigenomic alterations seen in ICF syndrome with DNMT3B mutations. Together, this study reveals crucial and distinctive substrate-readout mechanisms of the two DNMT3 enzymes, implicative of their differential roles during development and pathogenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Awakening of zygotic transcription in animal embryos relies on maternal pioneer transcription factors. The interplay of global and specific functions of these proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed nucleosome positioning, H3K27 acetylation, transcription, and gastrulation rates in zebrafish embryos lacking pluripotency factors Pou5f3 and Sox19b. We show that the bulk transcriptional onset does not require Sox19b and Pou5f3, but is sensitive to their balance. Pou5f3 docks H3K27ac on the enhancers of genes involved in gastrulation and ventral fate specification. Sox19b facilitates Pou5f3 access to one-third of these enhancers. The genes regulating mesendodermal and dorsal fates are primed for activation independently on Pou5f3 and Sox19b. Strikingly, the loss of either factor results in activation of silent enhancers; simultaneous loss of both leads to premature expression of differentiation genes. Our results uncover how independent activities of maternal Pou5f3 and Sox19b add up or antagonize to determine the early gene expression repertoire.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{garrido_identification_2020,
 abstract = {Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division occurring in sexually reproducing organisms to generate haploid cells known as gametes. In flowering plants, male gametes are produced in anthers, being encased in pollen grains. Understanding the genetic regulation of meiosis key events such as chromosome recognition and pairing, synapsis and recombination, is needed to manipulate chromosome associations for breeding purposes, particularly in important cereal crops like wheat. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyse gene expression and to validate the results obtained by other transcriptomic analyses, like RNA-seq. Selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is essential to obtain reproducible and accurate expression data. In this work, twelve candidate reference genes were evaluated using the mainstream algorithms geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and ΔCt, then ranked from most to least suitable for normalization with RefFinder. Different sets of reference genes were recommended to normalize gene expression data in anther meiosis of bread and durum wheat, their corresponding genotypes in the absence of the Ph1 locus and for comparative studies among wheat genotypes. Comparisons between meiotic (anthers) and somatic (leaves and roots) wheat tissues were also carried out. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first comprehensive list of reference genes for robust RT-qPCR normalization to study differentially expressed genes during male meiosis in wheat in a breeding framework.},

@article{gener_full-coverage_2019,
 abstract = {Objective: To evaluate native RNA sequencing for sequencing HIV-1 viral genomes. Methods: Fifteen HIV-1 strains were processed with Direct RNA Sequencing (SQK-RNA002) library kits and sequenced on MinION Mk1B devices with RevD flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). Raw reads were converted to FASTQ, aligned to reference sequences, and assembled into contigs. Multi-sequence alignments of the contigs were generated and used for cladistics analysis. Results: We sequenced full-length HIV-1 from the transcriptional start site to 39 LTR (100\% virion genome) in 3 out of 15 isolates (89.6, NLAD8, AD17), achieving majority coverage (defined as \&gt; 50\%) in another 7 out of 15 isolates. Inspection of NLAD8 sequence alignments revealed splicing or deletion signatures. Despite the strong 3′ bias, read coverage was sufficient to evaluate single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions in 9 isolates, and to assemble HIV-1 genomes directly from viral RNA, achieving a maximum of 94\% assembly coverage for NLAD8. Phylogenetic relationships were maintained at the level of contigs, as well as individual reads. Conclusions: ONT native RNA sequencing performed as expected, covering full-length HIV-1 RNA without PCR or cDNA sequencing. Native single-molecule RNA sequencing supported previous models of HIV-1 replication, and samples exhibited strain-specific transcriptional signals. We propose Context Dependency Variant Classification to describe variants occurring in information-dense regions of HIV. These data provide a rich resource for emerging RNA modification detection schemes. Future work will expand HIV-1 transcript profiling to infection models and clinical samples.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}X-chromosomal genes contribute to sex differences, in particular during early development, when both X chromosomes are active in females. Here, double X-dosage shifts female pluripotent cells towards the naive stem cell state by increasing pluripotency factor expression, inhibiting the differentiation-promoting MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and delaying differentiation. To identify the genetic basis of these sex differences, we have performed a series of CRISPR knockout screens in murine embryonic stem cells to comprehensively identify X-linked genes that cause the female pluripotency phenotype. We found multiple genes that act in concert, among which Klhl13 plays a central role. We show that this E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor protein promotes pluripotency factor expression, delays differentiation and represses MAPK target genes, and we identify putative substrates. We thus elucidate the mechanisms that drive sex-induced differences in pluripotent cells with implications for gender medicine in the context of induced pluripotent stem cell based therapies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of a non-invasive sampling procedure based on 13-gene DNA methylation analysis in the follow-up of patients previously treated for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Methods: The study population included 49 consecutive patients treated for OSCC. Oral brushing sample collection was performed at two different times: before any cancer treatment in the tumor mass and during patient follow-up almost 6 months after OSCC treatment, within the regenerative area after OSCC resection. Each sample was considered positive or negative in relation to a predefined cut-off value. Results: Before any cancer treatment, 47/49 specimens exceeded the score and were considered as positive. Six months after OSCC resection, 16/49 specimens also had positive scores in the samples collected from the regenerative area. During the follow-up period, 7/49 patients developed locoregional relapse: 6/7 patients had a positive score in the regenerative area after OSCC resection. The presence of a positive score after oral cancer treatment was the most powerful variable related to the appearance of locoregional relapse. Conclusion: 13-gene DNA methylation analysis by oral brushing may have a clinical application as a prognostic non-invasive tool in the follow-up of patients surgically treated for OSCC.},

@article{greenfield_modification_2020,
 abstract = {Dysregulation of epigenetic processes is increasingly understood to play a role in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Ruxolitinib, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, has proved a useful addition to the therapeutic arsenal for these disorders, but has limited disease modifying activity. We determined the effect of JAK inhibition on the histone landscape of MPN cells in cell line models of MPNs and validated using samples from the MAJIC randomised clinical trial of ruxolitinib in polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia. We demonstrated an epigenetic modifying effect of ruxolitinib using a histone modification assay. The majority of 21 histone H3 modifications were upregulated, with H3K27me3 and H3K36me2 significant in the combined cell line results. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CHIP-seq) for three marks of interest, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, was consistent with the histone modification assay showing a significant increase in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks at promoter regions, both marks of active transcription. In contrast, RNA sequencing demonstrates a coordinated reduction in gene expression in a number of cell pathways including PI3K-AKT signalling, transcriptional misregulation in cancer and JAK-STAT signalling in spite of these histone changes. This highlights the complex mechanisms of transcriptional control within the cells which was reflected in analysis of the histone landscape in patient samples following ruxolitinib treatment.},

 abstract = {Hypomethylating agents (HMA) have become the backbone of nonintensive acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) treatment, also by virtue of their activity in patients with adverse genetics, for example, monosomal karyotypes, often with losses on chromosome 7, 5, or 17. No comparable activity is observed with cytarabine, a cytidine analogue without DNA-hypomethylating properties. As evidence exists for compounding hypermethylation and gene silencing of hemizygous tumor suppressor genes (TSG), we thus hypothesized that this effect may preferentially be reversed by the HMAs decitabine and azacitidine. An unbiased RNA-sequencing approach was developed to interrogate decitabine-induced transcriptome changes in AML cell lines with or without a deletion of chromosomes 7q, 5q or 17p. HMA treatment preferentially upregulated several hemizygous TSG in this genomic region, significantly derepressing endogenous retrovirus (ERV)3–1, with promoter demethylation, enhanced chromatin accessibility, and increased H3K4me3 levels. Decitabine globally reactivated multiple transposable elements, with activation of the dsRNA sensor RIG-I and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7. Induction of ERV3–1 and RIG-I mRNA was also observed during decitabine treatment in vivo in serially sorted peripheral blood AML blasts. In patient-derived monosomal karyotype AML murine xenografts, decitabine treatment resulted in superior survival rates compared with cytarabine. Collectively, these data demonstrate preferential gene derepression and ERV reactivation in AML with chromosomal deletions, providing a mechanistic explanation that supports the clinical observation of superiority of HMA over cytarabine in this difficult-to-treat patient group.
Significance: These findings unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the intriguing clinical activity of HMAs in AML/MDS patients with chromosome 7 deletions and other monosomal karyotypes.See related commentary by O'Hagan et al., p. 813

The outer surface of CPs and ILFs is demarcated by a poorly characterized population of CD11c+ cells. Using genome-wide single-cell transcriptional profiling of intestinal mononuclear phagocytes and multidimensional flow cytometry, we found that CP- and ILF-associated CD11c+ cells were a transcriptionally distinct subset of intestinal cDCs, which we term CIA-DCs. CIA-DCs required programming by CP- and ILF-resident CCR6+ ILC3 via lymphotoxin-β receptor signaling in cDCs. CIA-DCs differentially expressed genes associated with immunoregulation and were the major cellular source of IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) at steady state. Mice lacking CIA-DC-derived IL-22BP exhibited diminished expression of epithelial lipid transporters, reduced lipid resorption, and changes in body fat homeostasis. Our findings provide insight into the design principles of an immunoregulatory checkpoint controlling nutrient absorption.},

In this study, we investigated the presence of T. halophilus in human samples using a polyphasic approach including scanning electron microscopy, molecular biology methods and microbial culture. This unique investigation yielded the unprecedented presence of T. halophilus in human feces samples, thus enriching the repertoire of halophilic microorganisms colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract with the isolation and culture of T. halophilus for the first time in humans. Using the E-test strips, the MIC was assessed for T. halophilus strain CSURQ6002: rifampicin (MIC at 0.002 μg/mL), benzylpenicillin (MIC at 0.094 μg/mL), amoxicillin (MIC at 0.5 μg/mL), erythromycin (MIC at 2 μg/mL), clindamycin (MIC at 4 μg/mL), and vancomycin (MIC at 8 μg/mL). However, this strain showed a MIC up to 256 μg/mL for ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, doxycyclin, imipenem, and colistin. In-silico profiling derived from whole genome sequencing (NCBI accession number: PRJNA780809), was confirmed. This discovery suggested that T. halophilus was part of the human digestive microbiota and that its potential role on human health should be considered.},

 abstract = {Mucociliary epithelia provide a first line of defense against pathogens. Impaired regeneration and remodeling of mucociliary epithelia are associated with dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in chronic airway diseases, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and studies yield seemingly contradicting results. Employing the Xenopus mucociliary epidermis, the mouse airway, and human airway Basal cells, we characterize the evolutionarily conserved roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vertebrates. In multiciliated cells, Wnt is required for cilia formation during differentiation. In Basal cells, Wnt prevents specification of epithelial cell types by activating ΔN-TP63, a master transcription factor, which is necessary and sufficient to mediate the Wnt-induced inhibition of specification and is required to retain Basal cells during development. Chronic Wnt activation leads to remodeling and Basal cell hyperplasia, which are reversible in vivo and in vitro, suggesting Wnt inhibition as a treatment option in chronic lung diseases. Our work provides important insights into mucociliary signaling, development, and disease.},

 abstract = {Increased life expectancy in modern society comes at the cost of age-associated disabilities and diseases. Aged brains not only show reduced excitability and plasticity, but also a decline in inhibition. Age-associated defects in inhibitory circuits likely contribute to cognitive decline and age-related disorders. Molecular mechanisms that exert epigenetic control of gene expression contribute to age-associated neuronal impairments. Both DNA methylation, mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and histone modifications maintain neuronal function throughout lifespan. Here we provide evidence that DNMT1 function is implicated in the age-related loss of cortical inhibitory interneurons. Dnmt1 deletion in parvalbumin-positive interneurons attenuates their age-related decline in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, DNMT1-deficient mice show improved somatomotor performance and reduced aging-associated transcriptional changes. A decline in the proteostasis network, responsible for the proper degradation and removal of defective proteins, is implicated in age- and disease- related neurodegeneration. Our data suggest that DNMT1 acts indirectly on interneuron survival in aged mice by modulating the proteostasis network during life-time.},

 abstract = {Biological control is emerging as a feasible alternative to chemical pesticides in agriculture. Measuring the microbial biocontrol agent (mBCA) populations in the environment is essential for an accurate risk assessment and to optimize the usage of an mBCA-based plant protection product. In this manuscript, a workflow to obtain a large number of qPCR markers suitable for robust strain-specific detection and quantification is presented. The workflow starts from whole genome sequencing data and consists on (i) identifying the strain-specific sequences, (ii) designing specific primer/probe sets for qPCR assays, and (iii) empirically verifying the performance of the assays. The first two stages involve exclusively computer work, but they are intended for researchers with little or no bioinformatic background: only knowledge of the BLAST suite tools and working with spreadsheets are required, and familiarity with the Galaxy environment and next-generation sequencing concepts are strongly advised. All bioinformatic work can be implemented using publically available resources and a regular desktop computer, no matter the operating system, connected to the Internet. The workflow was tested with 5 bacterial strains from different species under development as mBCAs, and yielded thousands of candidate markers and a triplex qPCR assay for each candidate mBCA. The qPCR assays were successfully tested in soils of different nature, water from different sources, and samples from different plant tissues. The mBCA detection limits and population dynamics in the different matrices are similar to those in qPCR assasys designed by other means. In summary a new accessible, amenable, cost-effective and robust, workflow to obtain a large number of strain-specific qPCR markers, is presented.},

 abstract = {The adult mammalian heart consists of mononuclear and binuclear cardiomyocytes (CMs) with various ploidies. However, it remains unclear whether a variation in ploidy or number of nuclei is associated with distinct functions and injury responses in CMs, including regeneration. Therefore, we investigated transcriptomes and cellular as well as nuclear features of mononucleated and binucleated CMs in adult mouse hearts with and without injury. To be able to identify the role of ploidy we analyzed control and failing human ventricular CMs because human CMs show a larger and disease-sensitive degree of polyploidization. Using transgenic Myh6-H2BmCh to identify mononucleated and binucleated mouse CMs, we found that cellular volume and RNA content were similar in both. On average nuclei of mononuclear CMs showed a 2-fold higher ploidy, as compared to binuclear CMs indicating that most mononuclear CMs are tetraploid. After myocardial infarction mononucleated and binucleated CMs in the border zone of the lesion responded with hypertrophy and corresponding changes in gene expression, as well as a low level of induction of cell cycle gene expression. Human CMs allowed us to study a wide range of polyploidy spanning from 2n to 16n. Notably, basal as well as pathological gene expression signatures and programs in failing CMs proved to be independent of ploidy. In summary, gene expression profiles were induced in proximity to injury, but independent of number of nuclei or ploidy levels in CMs.},

 abstract = {Balanced signal transduction is crucial in tissue patterning, particularly in the vasculature. Heterotopic ossification (HO) is tightly linked to vascularization with increased vessel number in hereditary forms of HO, such as Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). FOP is caused by mutations in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 leading to aberrant SMAD1/5 signaling in response to ActivinA. Whether observed vascular phenotype in human FOP lesions is connected to aberrant ActivinA signaling is unknown. Blocking of ActivinA prevents HO in FOP mice indicating a central role of the ligand in FOP. Here, we established a new FOP endothelial cell model generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iECs) to study ActivinA signaling. FOP iECs recapitulate pathogenic ActivinA/SMAD1/5 signaling. Whole transcriptome analysis identified ActivinA mediated activation of the BMP/NOTCH pathway exclusively in FOP iECs, which was rescued to WT transcriptional levels by the drug candidate Saracatinib. We propose that ActivinA causes transcriptional pre-patterning of the FOP endothelium, which might contribute to differential vascularity in FOP lesions compared to non-hereditary HO.},

 abstract = {Background Reticulated platelets (RP) are the youngest circulating platelets in blood. An increased amount of this subpopulation is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and mortality. Objectives It is unknown to what extent intrinsic properties of RP contribute to their hyperreactive features. This study is the first providing a multifactorial approach based on ultrastructural, transcriptional, and functional analysis of RP compared to non-RP sorted by flow cytometry. Methods Reticulated platelets and non-RP were sorted after platelet staining with SYTO 13. Employing transmission electron microscopy, 1089 micrographs were analyzed for platelet size, amounts of intracellular structures, and anatomical surrogates indicating activation. Long and small RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for analyzing differential gene expression. Functional analysis of P-selectin—an upregulated mRNA in RP—was performed in healthy subjects and patients on P2Y12-inhibitors. Results Electron micrographs uncovered distinct ultrastructural differences in RP versus non-RP. Cross sections were 1.9-fold larger in RP (P {\textless} .0001). Amounts of α-granules, dense granules, open canalicular system-openings, and mitochondria were increased in RP, which persisted after adjustment for platelet size. Long RNA-seq showed 1212 upregulated transcripts that are predominantly associated to platelet shape change, aggregation, and activation; 1264 mRNAs were downregulated in RP. Small RNA-seq did not reveal any differentially expressed transcripts. Functional analysis displayed higher P-selectin expression as compared to non-RP upon ADP- or TRAP-stimulation. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that altered intrinsic structural and molecular properties contribute to the hyperreactivity of RP. These properties and an increased amount of RP may account for the association with cardiovascular risk.},

@article{hofacker_engineering_2020,
 abstract = {Epigenome editing is a promising technology, potentially allowing the stable reprogramming of gene expression profiles without alteration of the DNA sequence. Targeted DNA methylation has been successfully documented by many groups for silencing selected genes, but recent publications have raised concerns regarding its specificity. In the current work, we developed new EpiEditors for programmable DNA methylation in cells with a high efficiency and improved specificity. First, we demonstrated that the catalytically deactivated Cas9 protein (dCas9)-SunTag scaffold, which has been used earlier for signal amplification, can be combined with the DNMT3A-DNMT3L single-chain effector domain, allowing for a strong methylation at the target genomic locus. We demonstrated that off-target activity of this system is mainly due to untargeted freely diffusing DNMT3A-DNMT3L subunits. Therefore, we generated several DNMT3A-DNMT3L variants containing mutations in the DNMT3A part, which reduced their endogenous DNA binding. We analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation of selected variants and confirmed a striking reduction of untargeted methylation, most pronounced for the R887E mutant. For all potential applications of targeted DNA methylation, the efficiency and specificity of the treatment are the key factors. By developing highly active targeted methylation systems with strongly improved specificity, our work contributes to future applications of this approach.},

 abstract = {The switch/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) complex is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller that regulates the spacing of nucleosomes and thereby controls gene expression. Heterozygous mutations in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF complex have been reported in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), with the majority of the mutations in \textit{ARID1B}. CSS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, digital anomalies, and variable intellectual disability. We hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding subunits of the ubiquitously expressed SWI/SNF complex may lead to alterations of the nucleosome profiles in different cell types. We performed the first study on CSS-patient samples and investigated the nucleosome landscapes of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from blood plasma by whole-genome sequencing. In addition, we studied the nucleosome landscapes of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes from CSS-affected individuals by nucleosome occupancy and methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) as well as their expression profiles. In cfDNA of CSS-affected individuals with heterozygous \textit{ARID1B} mutations, we did not observe major changes in the nucleosome profile around transcription start sites. In CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes, we found few genomic regions with different nucleosome occupancy when compared to controls. RNA-seq analysis of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes of these individuals detected only few differentially expressed genes, which were not in proximity to any of the identified differential nucleosome-depleted regions. In conclusion, we show that heterozygous mutations in the human SWI/SNF subunit ARID1B do not have a major impact on the nucleosome landscape or gene expression in blood cells. This might be due to functional redundancy, cell-type specificity, or alternative functions of ARID1B.},

 abstract = {Skip to Next Section
The Malpighian tubules (MTs) and hindgut constitute the functional kidney of insects. MTs are outpouchings of the gut and in most insects demonstrate proximodistal heterogeneity in function. In most insects, such heterogeneity is confined to ion/fluid secretion in the distal portion and ion/fluid reabsorption in the proximal portion. In contrast, MTs of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars of butterflies and moths) are composed of five regions that differ in their association with the gut, their structure and ion/fluid transport function. Recent studies have shown that several regions can rapidly and reversibly switch between ion secretion and reabsorption. The present study employed RNAseq, pharmacology and electrophysiology to characterize four distinct regions of the MT in larval Trichoplusia ni. Luminal microelectrode measurements indicate changes in [K+], [Na+] and pH as fluid passes through different regions of the tubule. In addition, the regions examined differ in gene ontology enrichment, and demonstrate robust gradients in expression of ion transporters and endocrine ligand receptors. Lastly, the study provides evidence for direct involvement of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in epithelial ion transport of insect MTs.},

 abstract = {Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) group proteins regulate various developmental processes in plants by repressing target genes via H3K27 trimethylation, and they function antagonistically with H3K4 trimethylation mediated by Trithorax group proteins. Tuberization in potato has been widely studied, but the role of histone modifications in this process is unknown. Recently, we showed that overexpression of StMSI1, a PRC2 member, alters the expression of tuberization genes in potato. As MSI1 lacks histone-modification activity, we hypothesized that this altered expression could be caused by another PRC2 member, StE(z)2, a potential H3K27 methyltransferase in potato. Here, we demonstrate that a short-day photoperiod influences StE(z)2 expression in the leaves and stolons. StE(z)2 overexpression alters plant architecture and reduces tuber yield, whereas its knockdown enhances yield. ChIP-sequencing using stolons induced by short-days indicated that several genes related to tuberization and phytohormones, such as StBEL5/11/29, StSWEET11B, StGA2OX1, and StPIN1 carry H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 marks and/or are StE(z)2 targets. Interestingly, we observed that another important tuberization gene, StSP6A, is targeted by StE(z)2 in leaves and that it has increased deposition of H3K27me3 under long-day (non-induced) conditions compared to short days. Overall, our results show that StE(z)2 and deposition of H3K27me3 and/or H3K4me3 marks might regulate the expression of key tuberization genes in potato.},

 abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled to advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, have facilitated system-wide quantitative profiling of expressed mRNA transcripts and proteins. Proteo-transcriptomic analysis compares the relative abundance levels of transcripts and their corresponding proteins, illuminating discordant gene product responses to perturbations. These results reveal potential post-transcriptional regulation, providing researchers with important new insights into underlying biological and pathological disease mechanisms. To carry out proteo-transcriptomic analysis, researchers require software that statistically determines transcript–protein abundance correlation levels and provides results visualization and interpretation functionality, ideally within a flexible, user-friendly platform. As a solution, we have developed the QuanTP software within the Galaxy platform. The software offers a suite of tools and functionalities critical for proteo-transcriptomics, including statistical algorithms for assessing the correlation between single transcript–protein pairs as well as across two cohorts, outlier identification and clustering, along with a diverse set of results visualizations. It is compatible with analyses of results from single experiment data or from a two-cohort comparison of aggregated replicate experiments. The tool is available in the Galaxy Tool Shed through a cloud-based instance and a Docker container. In all, QuanTP provides an accessible and effective software resource, which should enable new multiomic discoveries from quantitative proteo-transcriptomic data sets.},

These pipelines, also known as workflows, can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To help researchers with creating workflows, a system is developed to recommend tools that can facilitate further data analysis.A model is developed to recommend tools using a deep learning approach by analysing workflows composed by researchers on the European Galaxy server. The higher-order dependencies in workflows, represented as directed acyclic graphs, are learned by training a gated recurrent units neural network, a variant of a recurrent neural network. In the neural network training, the weights of tools used are derived from their usage frequencies over time and the sequences of tools are uniformly sampled from training data. Hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. Mean accuracy of 98\% in recommending tools is achieved for the top-1 metric.The model is accessed by a Galaxy API to provide researchers with recommended tools in an interactive manner using multiple user interface integrations on the European Galaxy server. High-quality and highly used tools are shown at the top of the recommendations.

 abstract = {In the present study, we report the draft genome of soil isolate DP-K7 that has the potential to degrade methyl red. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome analysis exposed that the bacterial strain DP-K7 belongs to the species Kocuria indica. The genome annotation of the strain DP-K7 through the bioinformatics tool “Prokka” showed that the genome contains 3,010,594 bp with 69.01\% GC content. The genome comprises 57 contigs including 2 rRNA genes, 47 tRNA genes, and 2754 CDS. The plate and broth assay showed that the strain DP-K7 has the potential to utilize methyl red as the sole carbon source for growth. Indeed, the RP-HPLC analysis proved that the strain DP-K7 is capable of degrading methyl red. The genome BLAST against a characterized azoreductase (AzoB—Xenophilus azovorans KF46F) revealed the presence of two azoreductase-like genes (azoKi-1 and azoKi-2). The phylogenetic analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of characterized azoreductases suggested that AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 belong to members of the clade IV azoreductase, which are flavin-independent. The multiple sequence alignment of AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 with flavin-independent azoreductases showed the presence of NAD(P)H binding like motif (GxxGxxG). In addition, other genes coding for dye degrading enzymes (SodC, SodA, KatA, KatE, and DyP2) were also found in the genome supporting that the strain K. indica DP-K7 is a potential azo dye degrader.},

 abstract = {The sRNA Yfr1 and members of the Yfr2 sRNA family are almost universally present within cyanobacteria. The conserved motifs of these sRNAs are nearly complementary to each other, suggesting their ability to participate in crosstalk. The conserved motif of Yfr1 is shared by members of the Yfr10 sRNA family, members of which are otherwise less conserved in sequence, structure, and synteny compared to Yfr1. The different structural properties enable the discrimination of unique targets of Yfr1 and Yfr10. Unlike most studied regulatory sRNAs, Yfr1 gene expression only slightly changes under the tested stress conditions and is present at high levels at all times. In contrast, cellular levels of Yfr10 increase during the course of acclimation to darkness, and levels of Yfr2 increase when cells are shifted to high light or nitrogen limitation conditions. In this study, we investigated the targetomes of Yfr2, Yfr1, and Yfr10 in Prochlorococcus MED4, establishing CRAFD-Seq as a new method for identifying direct targets of these sRNAs that is applicable to all bacteria, including those that are not amenable to genetic modification. The results suggest that these sRNAs are integrated within a regulatory network of unprecedented complexity in the adjustment of carbon and nitrogen-related primary metabolism.},

 abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other auxiliary proteins for cell entry. Recent studies have described conjunctival congestion in 0.8\% of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and there has been speculation that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the conjunctiva. However, it is currently unclear whether conjunctival epithelial cells express ACE2 and its cofactors. In this study, a total of 38 conjunctival samples from 38 patients, including 12 healthy conjunctiva, 12 melanoma, 7 squamous cell carcinoma and 7 papilloma samples, were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mRNA expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and its cofactors including TMPRSS2, ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. ACE2 protein expression was assessed in eight healthy conjunctival samples using immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is not substantially expressed in conjunctival samples on the mRNA (median 0.0 transcripts per million (TPM), min 0.0 TPM, max 1.7 TPM) and protein levels. Similar results were obtained for the transcription of other auxiliary molecules. In conclusion, this study finds no evidence for a significant expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary mediators for cell entry in conjunctival samples, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV-2 via these mediators unlikely.

@article{larsen_identification_2019,
 abstract = {C-type lectin-like domain containing proteins (CTLDcps) mainly bind carbohydrate-based ligands, but also other ligands. CTLDcps are involved in several biological processes including cell adhesion, cell-cell interactions, and pathogen recognition. Pathogen recognition by myeloid cells, e.g. dendritic cells (DCs), can be facilitated through cell surface expressed CTLDcps. Cell surface expressed CTLDcps have been exploited in vaccine designs for specific targeting of human and mouse DCs using antibodies. In recent years, however, DC targeting using carbohydrate-based vaccines has gained interest due to low production cost, limited immunogenicity, and possibility of multivalent adjustment. In chicken, however, only a few CTLDcps have been identified. Identifying and annotating additional chicken CTLDcps (chCTLDcps) is needed to exploit carbohydrate-mediated DC targeting in chicken. Therefore, we searched the chicken GRCg6a assembly for novel chCTLDcps. We identified 28 chCTLDcps of which 10 had previously been described and also experimentally validated. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR confirmed mRNA expression of the remaining 18 identified chCTLDcps. A group of highly related chCTLDcps, moreover, was shown to be avian-specific and comprise novel members mapped to the proposed chicken natural killer gene complex. Two chCTLDcps, chCLEC17AL-A and chCLEC17AL-B, were found to share a recent common ancestor with CLEC17A. Putative mannose or fucose-binding sequence motifs, EPN and WND, were found in the CTLD of chCLEC17AL-A. Both contained intracellular internalisation and signalling sequence motifs. In conclusion, several chCTLDcps were identified and their expression confirmed. Both chCLEC17AL-A and -B showed promise as potential targets in carbohydrate-based chicken vaccine strategies. Determination of DC-specific expression of chCLEC17AL-A and -B, thus, might prove useful in chicken vaccinology.},

 abstract = {Background: Traditional omic analysis relies on p-value and fold change as selection criteria. There is an ongoing debate on their effectiveness in delivering systemic and robust interpretation, due to their dependence on assumptions of conformity with various parametric distributions.Here, we propose a threshold-free selection method based on robust, non-parametric statistics, ensuring independence from the statistical distribution properties and broad applicability. Such methods could adapt to different initial data distributions, contrary to statistical techniques based on fixed thresholds. Methods: Our work extends the Rank Products methodology with a neutral selection method of high information-extraction capacity. We introduce the calculation of the RP distribution\&rsquo;s entropy to isolate the features of interest by their contribution to the distribution\&rsquo;s information content. The aim is a methodology performing threshold-free identification of the differentially expressed features, which are highly informative about the phenomenon under scrutiny. Conclusions: Applying the proposed method on microarray (transcriptomic and DNA methylation) and RNAseq count data of varying sizes and noise presence, we observe robust convergence for the different parameterisations to stable cutoff points. Functional analysis through BioInfoMiner and EnrichR was used to evaluate the information potency of the resulting feature lists. Overall, the derived functional terms provide a systemic description highly compatible with the results of traditional statistical hypothesis testing techniques. The methodology behaves consistently across different data types. The feature lists are compact and information-rich, indicating phenotypic aspects specific to the tissue and biological phenomenon i nvestigated. Selection by information content measures efficiently addresses problems, emerging from arbitrary thresholding, thus facilitating the full automation of the analysis.},

@article{lengfelder_complex_2019,
 abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with compositional and functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, but specific contributions of individual bacteria to chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear. Enterococcus faecalis is a resident member of the human intestinal core microbiota that has been linked to the pathogenesis of IBD and induces chronic colitis in susceptible monoassociated IL-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of E. faecalis as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of E. faecalis isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10-/- mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the ethanolamine utilization (eut) locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of eut genes, deletion of ethanolamine utilization (∆eutVW) had no impact on E. faecalis colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10-/- mice. However, replacement of the E. faecalis wild type bacteria by a ∆eutVW mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10-/- mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of E. faecalis ethanolamine utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand E. faecalis gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type E. faecalis cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10-/- mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms E. faecalis gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in E. faecalis monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of E. faecalis genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking E. faecalis enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that E. faecalis ethanolamine metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis towards a protective function.},

 abstract = {Podocyte maintenance and stress resistance are exquisitely based on high basal rates of autophagy making these cells a unique model to unravel mechanisms of autophagy regulation. Polyamines have key cellular functions such as proliferation, nucleic acid biosynthesis and autophagy. Here we test whether endogenous spermidine signaling is a driver of basal and dynamic autophagy in podocytes by using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interfere with different steps of polyamine metabolism. Translational studies revealed altered spermidine signaling in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in vivo and in vitro. Exogenous spermidine supplementation emerged as new treatment strategy by successfully activating autophagy in vivo via inhibition of EP300, a protein with an essential role in controlling cell growth, cell division and prompting cells to differentiate to take on specialized functions. Surprisingly, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy based untargeted metabolomics of wild type and autophagy deficient primary podocytes revealed a positive feed-back mechanism whereby autophagy itself maintains polyamine metabolism and spermidine synthesis. The transcription factor MAFB acted as an upstream regulator of polyamine metabolism. Thus, our data highlight a novel positive feedback loop of autophagy and spermidine signaling allowing maintenance of high basal levels of autophagy as a key mechanism to sustain the filtration barrier. Hence, spermidine supplementation may emerge as a new therapeutic to restore autophagy in glomerular disease.},

Successful cases from academia and industrial demonstrated that the deep learning-based de novo molecular design could efficiently accelerate the drug discovery process. The flourish of the de novo molecular generation methods and applications created a great demand for the visualization and functional profiling for the de novo generated molecules. The rising of publicly available chemogenomic databases lays good foundations and creates good opportunities for comprehensive profiling of the de novo library.

DenovoProfiling could provide structural identification, chemical space exploration, drug mapping, and target \&amp;amp; pathway information. The comprehensive annotated information could give users a clear picture of their de novo library and could guide the further selection of candidates for synthesis and biological confirmation.

Whole genome DNA methylation analysis with basepair resolution of distinct cardiac cell types identified highly specific DNA methylation signatures of genic and regulatory regions. Interestingly, despite marked changes in gene expression, DNA methylation remained stable in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Integrated analysis of cell type-specific gene expression enabled us to assign the particular contribution of single cell types to the pathophysiology of the diabetic heart. Finally, analysis of gene regulation revealed ligand-receptor pairs as potential mediators of heterocellular interaction in the diabetic heart, with fibroblasts and monocytes showing the highest degree of interaction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In summary, cell type-specific analysis reveals differentially regulated gene programs that are associated with distinct biological processes in diabetes.

 abstract = {Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of human brain evolution is essential to understanding human cognition and mental disorders. We generated multi-omics profiles and constructed a high-resolution map of 3D genome architecture of rhesus macaque during corticogenesis. By comparing the 3D genomes of human, macaque, and mouse brains, we identified many human-specific chromatin structure changes, including 499 topologically associating domains (TADs) and 1,266 chromatin loops. The human-specific loops are significantly enriched in enhancer-enhancer interactions, and the regulated genes show human-specific expression changes in the subplate, a transient zone of the developing brain critical for neural circuit formation and plasticity. Notably, many human-specific sequence changes are located in the human-specific TAD boundaries and loop anchors, which may generate new transcription factor binding sites and chromatin structures in human. Collectively, the presented data highlight the value of comparative 3D genome analyses in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of brain development and evolution.},

Six Sst encoding genes (sst1 to sst6) have been identified in teleost fish genomes but little is known about their function. The present study aimed at replicating the context of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and clarifying the involvement of sst3 in the intestine innate defence barrier in zebrafish larvae. We first established a CRISP/Cas9 sst3 deficient line (MT) and analysed the morphological and transcriptomic response to 0.4\% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Alcian blue staining of larval sections 6 days post fertilization showed an increased in acidic mucins in the intestinal bulb and mid-intestine, with a much stronger response in the MT compared to wild type (WT). The transcriptomic analysis revealed that WT and MT shared enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways linked to catabolism, chondrocyte development, innate immune system, xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress. In contrast, the WT specific response to DSS was enriched in GO terms and pathways linked to transcription and translation, various developmental processes, regulation of biosynthetic processes, apelin signalling and apoptosis while the MT specific response included terms and pathways linked to protein metabolism and catabolic processes, extracellular matrix – receptor interaction and proteasome and chondrocyte development. Overall, this study demonstrated that Sst3 deficiency impairs insulin growth factor and adipocytokine signalling exacerbating the inflammatory response to DSS.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 pandemic is the first global health crisis to occur in the age of big genomic data. Although data generation capacity is well established and sufficiently standardized, analytical capacity is not. To establish analytical capacity it is necessary to pull together global computational resources and deliver the best open source tools and analysis workflows within a ready to use, universally accessible resource. Such a resource should not be controlled by a single research group, institution, or country. Instead it should be maintained by a community of users and developers who ensure that the system remains operational and populated with current tools. A community is also essential for facilitating the types of discourse needed to establish best analytical practices. Bringing together public computational research infrastructure from the USA, Europe, and Australia, we developed a distributed data analysis platform that accomplishes these goals. It is immediately accessible to anyone in the world and is designed for the analysis of rapidly growing collections of deep sequencing datasets. We demonstrate its utility by detecting allelic variants in high-quality existing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing datasets and by continuous reanalysis of COG-UK data.

 abstract = {In the present work, we assembled and characterized a de novo larval transcriptome of the Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus by taking advantage of publicly available databases with the goal of better understanding its larval development. The assembled transcriptome comprised 37,117 protein-coding transcripts, of which 13,633 full-length ({\textgreater}80\% coverage), with an Ex90N50 of 3061 bp and 76\% of complete and single-copy core vertebrate genes orthologues. Of these transcripts, 34,980 had a hit against the EggNOG database and 14,983 with the KEGG database. Codon usage bias was identified in processes such as translation and muscle development. By comparing our data with a set of representative fish species, 87.1\% of tuna transcripts were included in orthogroups with other species and 5.1\% in assembly-specific orthogroups, which were enriched in terms related to muscle and bone development, visual system and ion transport. Following this comparative approach, protein families related to myosin, extracellular matrix and immune system resulted significantly expanded in the Atlantic bluefin tuna. Altogether, these results provide a glimpse of how the Atlantic bluefin tuna might have achieved early physical advantages over competing species in the pelagic environment. The information generated lays the foundation for future research on the more detailed exploration of physiological responses at the molecular level in different larval stages and paves the way to evolutionary studies on the Atlantic bluefin tuna.},

Here, using interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we perform detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human CD4+ T helper 1 (Th-1) cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We identify CDK8 as a negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities, which interacts with STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecule inhibitors, reduces the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23\% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 S727 phosphorylation. STAT3 binding to target DNA sites in the genome is increased upon CDK8 inhibition, which results in a concomitant increase in STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions results in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity by modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to diversification of IL-6 responses.},

 abstract = {The predator Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) represents one of the major threats to honeybee survival. Viral spillover from bee to wasp has been supposed in several studies, and this work aims to identify and study the virome of both insect species living simultaneously in the same foraging area. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on V. velutina and Apis mellifera samples, and replicative form of detected viruses was carried out by strand-specific RT-PCR. Overall, 6 and 9 different viral types were reported in V. velutina and A. mellifera, respectively, and five of these viruses were recorded in both hosts. Varroa destructor virus-1 and Cripavirus NB-1/2011/HUN (now classified as Triato-like virus) were the most represented viruses detected in both hosts, also in replicative form. In this investigation, Triato-like virus, as well as Aphis gossypii virus and Nora virus, was detected for the first time in honeybees. Concerning V. velutina, we report for the first time the recently detected honeybee La Jolla virus. A general high homology rate between genomes of shared viruses between V. velutina and A. mellifera suggests the efficient transmission of the virus from bee to wasp. In conclusion, our findings highlight the presence of several known and newly reported RNA viruses infecting A. mellifera and V. velutina. This confirms the environment role as an important source of infection and indicates the possibility of spillover from prey to predator.},

However, the epigenetics of AMs development and function in IPF are limited. Here, we characterised the DNA-methylation (DNAm) profile of AMs from IPF (n=30) and healthy (n=14) donors. Our analysis revealed epigenetic heterogeneity was a key characteristic of IPF AMs. DNAm ‘clock’ analysis indicated epigenetic alterations in IPF-AMs was not associated with accelerated ageing. In differential DNAm analysis, we identified numerous differentially methylated positions (DMPs, n=11) and regions (DMRs, n=49) between healthy and IPF AMs respectively. DMPs and DMRs encompassed genes involved in lipid (\textit{LPCAT1}) and glucose (\textit{PFKB3}) metabolism and importantly, DNAm status was associated with disease severity in IPF. Collectively, our data identify that profound changes in the epigenome underpin the development and function of AMs in the IPF lung.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Advances in bioinformatics methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis have helped researchers to gain an in-depth knowledge about the taxonomic and genetic composition of microbial communities. Metagenomic-based methods have been the most commonly used approaches for microbiome analysis; however, it primarily extracts information about taxonomic composition and genetic potential of the microbiome under study, lacking quantification of the gene products (RNA and proteins). Conversely, metatranscriptomics, the study of a microbial community’s RNA expression, can reveal the dynamic gene expression of individual microbial populations and the community as a whole, ultimately providing information about the active pathways in the microbiome.  In order to address the analysis of NGS data, the ASaiM analysis framework was previously developed and made available via the Galaxy platform. Although developed for both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, the original publication demonstrated the use of ASaiM only for metagenomics, while thorough testing for metatranscriptomics data was lacking.  In the current study, we have focused on validating and optimizing the tools within ASaiM for metatranscriptomics data. As a result, we deliver a robust workflow that will enable researchers to understand dynamic functional response of the microbiome in a wide variety of metatranscriptomics studies. This improved and optimized ASaiM-metatranscriptomics (ASaiM-MT) workflow is publicly available via the ASaiM framework, documented and supported with training material so that users can interrogate and characterize metatranscriptomic data, as part of larger meta-omic studies of microbiomes.},

 abstract = {For mass spectrometry-based peptide and protein quantification, label-free quantification (LFQ) based on precursor mass peak (MS1) intensities is considered reliable due to its dynamic range, reproducibility, and accuracy. LFQ enables peptide-level quantitation, which is useful in proteomics (analyzing peptides carrying post-translational modifications) and multi-omics studies such as metaproteomics (analyzing taxon-specific microbial peptides) and proteogenomics (analyzing non-canonical sequences). Bioinformatics workflows accessible via the Galaxy platform have proven useful for analysis of such complex multi-omic studies. However, workflows within the Galaxy platform have lacked well-tested LFQ tools. In this study, we have evaluated moFF and FlashLFQ, two open-source LFQ tools, and implemented them within the Galaxy platform to offer access and use via established workflows. Through rigorous testing and communication with the tool developers, we have optimized the performance of each tool. Software features evaluated include: (a) match-between-runs (MBR); (b) using multiple file-formats as input for improved quantification; (c) use of containers and/or conda packages; (d) parameters needed for analyzing large datasets; and (e) optimization and validation of software performance. This work establishes a process for software implementation, optimization, and validation, and offers access to two robust software tools for LFQ-based analysis within the Galaxy platform.},

@article{mehta_updates_2021,
 abstract = {metaQuantome is a software suite that enables the quantitative analysis, statistical evaluation. and visualization of mass-spectrometry-based metaproteomics data. In the latest update of this software, we have provided several extensions, including a step-by-step training guide, the ability to perform statistical analysis on samples from multiple conditions, and a comparative analysis of metatranscriptomics data. The training module, accessed via the Galaxy Training Network, will help users to use the suite effectively both for functional as well as for taxonomic analysis. We extend the ability of metaQuantome to now perform multi-data-point quantitative and statistical analyses so that studies with measurements across multiple conditions, such as time-course studies, can be analyzed. With an eye on the multiomics analysis of microbial communities, we have also initiated the use of metaQuantome statistical and visualization tools on outputs from metatranscriptomics data, which complements the metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses already available. For this, we have developed a tool named MT2MQ (“metatranscriptomics to metaQuantome”), which takes in outputs from the ASaiM metatranscriptomics workflow and transforms them so that the data can be used as an input for comparative statistical analysis and visualization via metaQuantome. We believe that these improvements to metaQuantome will facilitate the use of the software for quantitative metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics and will enable multipoint data analysis. These improvements will take us a step toward integrative multiomic microbiome analysis so as to understand dynamic taxonomic and functional responses of these complex systems in a variety of biological contexts. The updated metaQuantome and MT2MQ are open-source software and are available via the Galaxy Toolshed and GitHub.},

@article{miao_putative_2020,
 abstract = {We present a novel method for automated identification of putative cell types from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. By iteratively applying a machine learning approach to an initial clustering of gene expression profiles of a given set of cells, we simultaneously identify distinct cell groups and a weighted list of feature genes for each group. The feature genes, which are differentially expressed in the particular cell group, jointly discriminate the given cell group from other cells. Each such group of cells corresponds to a putative cell type or state, characterised by the feature genes as markers. To benchmark this approach, we use expert-annotated scRNA-seq datasets from a range of experiments, as well as comparing to existing cell annotation methods, which are all based on a pre-existing reference. We show that our method automatically identifies the 'ground truth' cell assignments with high accuracy. Moreover, our method, Single Cell Clustering Assessment Framework (SCCAF) predicts new putative biologically meaningful cell-states in published data on haematopoiesis and the human cortex. SCCAF is available as an open-source software package on GitHub (https://github.com/SCCAF/sccaf) and as a Python package index and has also been implemented as a Galaxy tool in the Human Cell Atlas.},

Marine environments are among such niche that host a huge number of microbes and have a complex environment which pose the need to study these bacterial indicators of horizontal gene transfer events for survival and stability. The plasmid content of the metagenomics data from 8 sediment samples of the Gulfs of Kathiawar and an open Arabian Sea sample was screened. The reads corresponding to hits against the plasmid database were assembled and studied for diversity using Kraken and functional content using MG-RAST. The sequences were also checked for resistome and virulence factors. The replicon hosts were overall dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria while red algae specific to the Kutch samples. The genes encoded were dominant in the flagella motility and type VI secretion systems. Overall, results from the study confirmed that the plasmids encoded traits for metal, antibiotic, and phage resistance along with virulence systems, and these would be conferring benefit to the hosts. The study throws insights into the environmental role of the plasmidome in adaptation of the microbes in the studied sites to the environmental stresses.},

 abstract = {Background: Ultra-conserved non-coding elements (UCNEs) are genomic sequences that exhibit \&gt; 95\% sequence identity between humans, mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. Recent findings reported their functional role in cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the DNA methylation modifications of UNCEs in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from different mammal species. Methods: Fifty SCCs from 26 humans, 17 cats, 3 dogs, 1 horse, 1 bovine, 1 badger, and 1 porcupine were investigated. Fourteen feline stomatitis and normal samples from 36 healthy human donors, 7 cats, 5 dogs, 5 horses, 2 bovines and 1 badger were collected as normal controls. Bisulfite next generation sequencing evaluated the DNA methylation level from seven UCNEs (uc.160, uc.283, uc.416, uc.339, uc.270, uc.299, and uc.328). Results: 57/59 CpGs were significantly different according to the Kruskal\&ndash;Wallis test (p \&lt; 0.05) comparing normal samples with SCC. A common DNA hypermethylation pattern was observed in SCCs from all the species evaluated in this study, with an increasing trend of hypermethylation starting from normal mucosa, through stomatitis to SCC. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that UCNEs are hypermethylated in human SCC, and this behavior is also conserved among different species of mammals.},

Here, we compared microglial transcriptomes from young-adult and aged mice housed under germ-free and specific pathogen-free conditions and found that the microbiota influenced aging associated-changes in microglial gene expression. The absence of gut microbiota diminished oxidative stress and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia from the brains of aged mice. Unbiased metabolomic analyses of serum and brain tissue revealed the accumulation of N6-carboxymethyllysine (CML) in the microglia of the aging brain. CML mediated a burst of reactive oxygen species and impeded mitochondrial activity and ATP reservoirs in microglia. We validated the age-dependent rise in CML levels in the sera and brains of humans. Finally, a microbiota-dependent increase in intestinal permeability in aged mice mediated the elevated levels of CML. This study adds insight into how specific features of microglia from aged mice are regulated by the gut microbiota.},

However, most published preclinical data are not conducted according to the standard Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). GLP is mandatory for preclinical analysis of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP) and thereby a prerequisite for planning and conduction of clinical trials. Not inconsiderable numbers of clinical trials are terminated earlier or fail – do inadequate testing strategies or missing specialized assays during the preclinical development contribute to this severe complex of problems? Unfortunately, there is also a lack of access to GLP testing results and OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) GLP guidelines are not yet adjusted to ATMP specialties. Ultimately, GLP offers possibilities to generate reliable and reproducible data. Therefore, this review elucidates different GLP aspects in drug development, speculates on reasons of putative low GLP acceptance in the scientific community and mentions solution proposals.},

@article{muller_snp_2020,
 abstract = {Background
Diet induced weight loss represents an intervention for obesity to prevent associated diseases. However there is considerable inter-individual variation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and plasma miRNA might be contributing factors. We therefore hypothesized that changes in the miRNA pattern during weight loss depend on the SNP genotype.
Methods
Plasma miRNA profiles from 12 patients were determined before and after a three month weight loss intervention by Illumina sequencing. 46 further patients were analyzed by qPCR. SNP genotypes were determined on the Sequenom iPLEX platform.
Results
Samples before and after weight loss were analyzed by miRNA-seq and delta miRNA levels ranked according to p-value. Levels of miRNAs 25, 93 and 106 that are expressed from a common genomic cluster were reduced after weight loss. Those results were substantiated in a qPCR analysis of 46 additional patients. This is in accordance with mouse data showing a functional involvement of this cluster in obesity. Correlation of the changes in miRNA abundance with SNP genotypes revealed a statistical association of all three miRNAs with known obesity susceptibility SNPs.
Conclusion
Diet induced weight loss leads to SNP dependent modulation of miRNAs from the miR 25/93/106 gene cluster in humans.},

 abstract = {An intestinal epithelium model able to produce mucus was developed to provide an environment suitable for testing the therapeutic activity of gut bacteriophages. We show that Enterococcus faecalis adheres more effectively in the presence of mucus, can invade the intestinal epithelia and is able to translocate after damaging tight junctions. Furthermore, Enterococcus phage vB\_EfaM\_A2 (a member of Herelleviridae that possesses virion associated immunoglobin domains) was found to translocate through the epithelium in the presence and absence of its host bacteria. Phage A2 protected eukaryotic cells by reducing mortality and maintaining the structure of the cell layer structure. We suggest the mammalian cell model utilized within this study as an adaptable in vitro model that can be employed to enable a better understanding of phage\&ndash;bacteria interactions and the protective impact of phage therapy relating to the intestinal epithelium.},

@article{owen_rna-sequencing_2019,
 abstract = {High-throughput, massively parallel sequence analysis has revolutionized the way that researchers design and execute scientific investigations. Vast amounts of sequence data can be generated in short periods of time. Regarding ophthalmology and vision research, extensive interrogation of patient samples for underlying causative DNA mutations has resulted in the discovery of many new genes relevant to eye disease. However, such analysis remains functionally limited. RNA-sequencing accurately snapshots thousands of genes, capturing many subtypes of RNA molecules, and has become the gold standard for transcriptome gene expression quantification. RNA-sequencing has the potential to advance our understanding of eye development and disease; it can reveal new candidates to improve our molecular diagnosis rates and highlight therapeutic targets for intervention. But with a wide range of applications, the design of such experiments can be problematic, no single optimal pipeline exists, and therefore, several considerations must be undertaken for optimal study design. We review the key steps involved in RNA-sequencing experimental design and the downstream bioinformatic pipelines used for differential gene expression. We provide guidance on the application of RNAsequencing to ophthalmology and sources of open-access eye-related data sets.},

@article{parenti_mau2_2020,
 abstract = {The NIPBL/MAU2 heterodimer loads cohesin onto chromatin. Mutations in NIPBL account for most cases of the rare developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). Here we report a MAU2 variant causing CdLS, a deletion of seven amino acids that impairs the interaction between MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus. Investigating this interaction, we discovered that MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus are largely dispensable for normal cohesin and NIPBL function in cells with a NIPBL early truncating mutation. Despite a predicted fatal outcome of an out-of-frame single nucleotide duplication in NIPBL, engineered in two different cell lines, alternative translation initiation yields a form of NIPBL missing N-terminal residues. This form cannot interact with MAU2, but binds DNA and mediates cohesin loading. Altogether, our work reveals that cohesin loading can occur independently of functional NIPBL/MAU2 complexes and highlights a novel mechanism protective against out-of-frame mutations that is potentially relevant for other genetic conditions.},

@article{perezriverol_scalable_2019,
 abstract = {The recent improvements in mass spectrometry instruments and new analytical methods are increasing the intersection between proteomics and big data science. In addition, bioinformatics analysis is becoming increasingly complex and convoluted, involving multiple algorithms and tools. A wide variety of methods and software tools have been developed for computational proteomics and metabolomics during recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. However, most of the computational proteomics and metabolomics tools are designed as single-tiered software application where the analytics tasks can't be distributed, limiting the scalability and reproducibility of the data analysis. In this paper we summarise the key steps of metabolomics and proteomics data processing, including the main tools and software used to perform the data analysis. We discuss the combination of software containers with workflows environments for large scale metabolomics and proteomics analysis. Finally, we introduce to the proteomics and metabolomics communities a new approach for reproducible and large-scale data analysis based on BioContainers and two of the most popular workflow environments: Galaxy and Nextflow.

@article{pinter_functional_2021,
 abstract = {The lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a pivotal role in cellular differentiation by regulating the expression of key developmental genes in concert with different coregulatory proteins. This process is impaired in different cancer types and incompletely understood. To comprehensively identify functional coregulators of LSD1, we established a novel tractable fluorescent reporter system to monitor LSD1 activity in living cells. Combining this reporter system with a state-of-the-art multiplexed RNAi screen, we identify the DEAD-box helicase 19A (DDX19A) as a novel coregulator and demonstrate that suppression of Ddx19a results in an increase of R-loops and reduced LSD1-mediated gene silencing. We further show that DDX19A binds to tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and it regulates gene expression through the removal of transcription promoting R-loops. Our results uncover a novel transcriptional regulatory cascade where the downregulation of genes is dependent on the LSD1 mediated demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). This allows the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to methylate H3K27, which serves as a binding site for DDX19A. Finally, the binding of DDX19A leads to the efficient removal of R-loops at active promoters, which further de-represses LSD1 and PRC2, establishing a positive feedback loop leading to a robust repression of the target gene.},

@article{qi_secreted_2020,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Multicellular organisms coordinate tissue specific response to environmental information via both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. In addition to secreted ligands, secreted small RNAs have recently been reported to regulate gene expression across tissue boundaries. Here we show that the conserved poly-U specific endoribonuclease ENDU-2 is secreted from the soma and taken-up by the germline to ensure germline immortality at elevated temperature in C. elegans. ENDU-2 binds to mature mRNAs and negatively regulates mRNA abundance both in the soma and the germline. While ENDU-2 promotes RNA decay in the soma directly via its endoribonuclease activity, ENDU-2 prevents misexpression of soma-specific genes in the germline and preserves germline immortality independent of its RNA-cleavage activity.

A key aspect to providing care for those with COVID-19 and checking its further spread is early and accurate diagnosis of infection, which has been generally done via methods for amplifying and detecting viral RNA molecules. Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting; many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples. However, evidence suggests that some viral peptides could serve as better indicators of COVID-19 infection status than others, due to potential misidentification of peptides derived from human host proteins, poor spectral quality, high limits of detection etc.},

@article{rasche_training_2020,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Hands-on training, whether it is in Bioinformatics or other scientific domains, requires significant resources and knowledge to setup and run. Trainers must have access to infrastructure that can support the sudden spike in usage, with classes of 30 or more trainees simultaneously running resource-intensive tools. For efficient classes, the jobs must run quickly, without queuing delays, lest they disrupt the timetable set out for the class. Often times this is achieved via running on a private server where there is no contention for the queue, and therefore no or minimal waiting time. However, this requires the teacher or trainer to have the technical knowledge to manage compute infrastructure, in addition to their didactic responsibilities. This presents significant burdens to potential training events, in terms of infrastructure cost, person-hours of preparation, technical knowledge, and available staff to manage such events. Findings: Galaxy Europe has developed Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS) which we provide to the scientific commnuity as a service built on top of the Galaxy Platform. Training event organisers request a training and Galaxy administrators can allocate private queues specifically for the training. Trainees are transparently placed in a private queue where their jobs run without delay. Trainers access the dashboard of the TIaaS Service and can remotely follow the progress of their trainees without in-person interactions. Conclusions: TIaaS on Galaxy Europe provides reusable and fast infrastructure for Galaxy training. The instructor dashboard provides visibility into class progress, making in-person trainings more efficient and remote training possible. In the past 24 months, \$\&gt;110\$ trainings with over 3000 trainees have used this infrastructure for training, across scientific domains, all enjoying the accessibility and reproducibility of Galaxy for training the next generation of bioinformaticians. TIaaS itself is an extension to Galaxy which can be deployed by any Galaxy administrator to provide similar benefits for their users. https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Abstract Tissues in multicellular organisms are populated by resident macrophages, which perform both generic and tissue-specific functions. The latter are induced by signals from the microenvironment and rely on unique tissue-specific molecular programs requiring the combinatorial action of tissue-specific and broadly expressed transcriptional regulators. Here, we identify the transcription factors Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as novel regulators of alveolar macrophages (AMs)?a population that provides the first line of immune defense and executes homeostatic functions in lung alveoli. In the absence of these factors, AMs exhibited decreased proliferation that resulted in a severe disadvantage of knockout AMs in a competitive setting. Gene expression analyses revealed a broad cell-intrinsic footprint of Bhlhe40/Bhlhe41 deficiency manifested by a downregulation of AM signature genes and induction of signature genes of other macrophage lineages. Genome-wide characterization of Bhlhe40 DNA binding suggested that these transcription factors directly repress the expression of lineage-inappropriate genes in AMs. Taken together, these results identify Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as key regulators of AM self-renewal and guardians of their identity.},

Intriguingly, several key positive regulators of the GC reaction are common for both cell types. Here, we report that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 is a crucial cell-intrinsic negative regulator affecting both the B and T cell sides of the GC reaction. In activated CD4 T cells, Bhlhe40 was required to restrain proliferation thus limiting the number of T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells. In B cells, Bhlhe40 executed its function in the first days after immunization by selectively restricting the generation of the earliest GC B cells but not of early memory B cells or plasmablasts. Conditional Bhlhe40 inactivation confirmed cell-autonomous functions of Bhlhe40 in both GC B and T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells, while the GC phenotype was further enhanced upon loss of Bhlhe40 in both cell types. This negative regulation of the GC reaction by Bhlhe40 was of crucial importance, as Bhlhe40-deficient mice with progressing age succumbed to a B cell lymphoma characterized by accumulation of monoclonal GC B-like cells and polyclonal T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells in various tissues.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@phdthesis{sabrina_statistical_2020,
 abstract = {Protein-RNA interactions play an important role in all post-transcriptional regulatory processes. High throughput detection of protein-RNA interactions has been facilitated by the emerging CLIP-seq (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing) techniques. Enrichments in mapped reads as well as base transitions or deletions at crosslink sites can be used to infer binding regions. Single-nucleotide resolution techniques (iCLIP and eCLIP) have been achieved by capturing high fractions of cDNAs which are truncated at protein-RNA crosslink sites. Increasing numbers of datasets and derivatives of these protocols have been published in recent years, requiring tailored computational analyses. Existing methods unfortunately do not explicitly model the specifics of truncation patterns and possible biases caused by background binding or crosslinking sequence preferences. 
We present PureCLIP, a hidden Markov model based approach, which simultaneously performs peak calling and individual crosslink site detection. It is capable of incorporating external data to correct for non-specific background signals and, for the first time, for the crosslinking biases. We devised a comprehensive evaluation based on three strategies. Firstly, we developed a workflow to simulate iCLIP data, which starts from real RNA-seq data and known binding regions and then mimics the experimental steps of the iCLIP protocol, including the generation of background signals. Secondly, we used experimental iCLIP and eCLIP datasets, using the proteins’ known predominant binding regions. And thirdly, we assessed the agreement of called sites between replicates, assuming target-specific signals are reproducible between replicates. 
On both simulated and real data, PureCLIP is consistently more precise in calling crosslink sites than other state-of-the-art methods. In particular when incorporating input control data and crosslink associated motifs (CL-motifs) PureCLIP is up to 13\% more precise than other methods and we show that it has an up to 20\% higher agreement across replicates. Moreover, our method can optionally merge called crosslink sites to binding regions based on their distance and we show that the resulting regions reflect the known binding regions with high-resolution. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method achieves a high precision robustly over a range of different settings and performs well for proteins with different binding characteristics. Lastly, we extended the method to include individual CLIP replicates and show that this can boost the precision even further. PureCLIP and its documenta- tion are publicly available at https://github.com/skrakau/PureCLIP.},

@article{sajulga_survey_2020,
 abstract = {To gain a thorough appreciation of microbiome dynamics, researchers characterize the functional relevance of expressed microbial genes or proteins. This can be accomplished through metaproteomics, which characterizes the protein expression of microbiomes. Several software tools exist for analyzing microbiomes at the functional level by measuring their combined proteome-level response to environmental perturbations. In this survey, we explore the performance of six available tools, to enable researchers to make informed decisions regarding software choice based on their research goals. Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from dental caries plaque samples grown with and without sucrose in paired biofilm reactors were used as representative data for this evaluation. Microbial peptides from one sample pair were identified by the X! tandem search algorithm via SearchGUI and subjected to functional analysis using software tools including eggNOG-mapper, MEGAN5, MetaGOmics, MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA), ProPHAnE, and Unipept to generate functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Among these software tools, notable differences in functional annotation were detected after comparing differentially expressed protein functional groups. Based on the generated GO terms of these tools we performed a peptide-level comparison to evaluate the quality of their functional annotations. A BLAST analysis against the NCBI non-redundant database revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of functional annotation varied between tools. For example, eggNOG-mapper mapped to the most number of GO terms, while Unipept generated more accurate GO terms. Based on our evaluation, metaproteomics researchers can choose the software according to their analytical needs and developers can use the resulting feedback to further optimize their algorithms. To make more of these tools accessible via scalable metaproteomics workflows, eggNOG-mapper and Unipept 4.0 were incorporated into the Galaxy platform.},

In the context of epithelial ovarian cancer, a highly heterogeneous disease with diverse subtypes, it is paramount to study a wide panel of models in order to draw a representative picture of the disease. As this lethal gynaecological malignancy has seen little improvement in overall survival in the last decade, it is all the more pressing to support future research with robust and diverse study models. Here, we describe ten novel spontaneously immortalized patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines, detailing their respective mutational profiles and gene/biomarker expression patterns, as well as their in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics. Eight of the cell lines were classified as high-grade serous, while two were determined to be of the rarer mucinous and clear cell subtypes, respectively. Each of the ten cell lines presents a panel of characteristics reflective of diverse clinically relevant phenomena, including chemotherapeutic resistance, metastatic potential, and subtype-associated mutations and gene/protein expression profiles. Importantly, four cell lines formed subcutaneous tumors in mice, a key characteristic for pre-clinical drug testing. Our work thus contributes significantly to the available models for the study of ovarian cancer, supplying additional tools to better understand this complex disease.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have deciphered the transcriptional profile of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in body donor eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and were thus limited by the time span from death to preservation and the associated 5'-RNA degradation. Therefore, this study used CNV and control specimens which had been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded immediately after surgical extraction and analyzed them using a 3’ RNA sequencing approach. Transcriptome profiles were analyzed and used to estimate content of immune and stromal cells and to define disease-associated gene signatures using statistical and bioinformatic methods. We identified 158 differentially-expressed genes (DEG) that were significantly increased in CNV compared to control tissue. Cell type enrichment analysis revealed a diverse cellular landscape with an enrichment of immune and stroma cell types in CNV including endothelial cells, macrophages, T cells and NKT cells. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that DEG contributed to Blood Vessel Development, Extracellular Structure Organization, Response to Wounding and several immune-related terms. The S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) and S100A9 emerged among the top DEG, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry on CNV tissue and protein analysis of vitreous samples. This study provides a high-resolution RNA-sequencing-based transcriptional signature of human CNV, characterizes its compositional pattern of immune and stromal cells and reveals S100A8/A9 as a novel biomarker and promising target for AMD-directed therapeutics and diagnostics.},

BRIDGE makes available tools and workflows to carry out protein molecular dynamics simulations and accurate free energy computations of protein-ligand binding. We illustrate the dynamics and simulation protocols for predicting protein-ligand binding affinities in silico on the T4 lysozyme system. This protocol is suitable for both novice and experienced practitioners. We show that with BRIDGE, protocols can be shared with collaborators or made publicly available, thus making simulation results and computations independently verifiable and reproducible., Bio-protocol is an online peer-reviewed protocol journal.

 abstract = {Synonymous mutations have been viewed as silent mutations, since they only affect the DNA and mRNA, but not the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein. Nonetheless, recent studies suggest their significant impact on splicing, RNA stability, RNA folding, translation or co-translational protein folding. Hence, we compile 659194 synonymous mutations found in human cancer and characterize their properties. We provide the user-friendly, comprehensive resource for synonymous mutations in cancer, SynMICdb (http://SynMICdb.dkfz.de), which also contains orthogonal information about gene annotation, recurrence, mutation loads, cancer association, conservation, alternative events, impact on mRNA structure and a SynMICdb score. Notably, synonymous and missense mutations are depleted at the 5'-end of the coding sequence as well as at the ends of internal exons independent of mutational signatures. For patient-derived synonymous mutations in the oncogene KRAS, we indicate that single point mutations can have a relevant impact on expression as well as on mRNA secondary structure., Synonymous mutations do not alter amino acid sequence but may exert oncogenic effects in other ways. Here, the authors present a catalogue of synonymous mutations in cancer and characterise their properties.},

 abstract = {Macrophages (MΦ), known for immunological roles such as phagocytosis and antigen presentation, have been found to electrotonically couple to cardiomyocytes (CM) of the atrio-ventricular node via Cx43, affecting cardiac conduction in isolated mouse hearts. Here, we characterise passive and active electrophysiological properties of murine cardiac resident MΦ, and model their potential electrophysiological relevance for CM.We combined classic electrophysiological approaches with 3 D florescence imaging, RNA-sequencing, pharmacological interventions and computer simulations. We used Cx3cr1eYFP/+ mice wherein cardiac MΦ were fluorescently labelled. FACS-purified fluorescent MΦ from mouse hearts were studied by whole-cell patch-clamp. MΦ electrophysiological properties include: membrane resistance 2.2 ± 0.1 GΩ (all data mean±SEM), capacitance 18.3 ± 0.1 pF, resting membrane potential -39.6 ± 0.3 mV, and several voltage-activated, outward or inwardly-rectifying potassium currents. Using ion channel blockers (barium, TEA, 4-AP, margatoxin, XEN-D0103, DIDS), flow cytometry, immuno-staining and RNA-sequencing, we identified Kv1.3, Kv1.5 and Kir2.1 as channels contributing to observed ion currents. MΦ displayed four patterns for outward and two for inward-rectifier potassium currents. Additionally, MΦ showed surface expression of Cx43, a prerequisite for homo- and/or heterotypic electrotonic coupling. Experimental results fed into development of an original computational model to describe cardiac MΦ electrophysiology. Computer simulations to quantitatively assess plausible effects of MΦ on electrotonically coupled CM showed that MΦ can depolarise resting CM, shorten early and prolong late action potential duration, with effects depending on coupling strength and individual MΦ electrophysiological properties, in particular resting membrane potential and presence/absence of Kir2.1.Our results provide a first electrophysiological characterisation of cardiac resident MΦ, and a computational model to quantitatively explore their relevance in the heterocellular heart. Future work will be focussed at distinguishing electrophysiological effects of MΦ–CM coupling on both cell types during steady-state and in patho-physiological remodelling, when immune cells change their phenotype, proliferate, and/or invade from external sources.Cardiac tissue contains resident macrophages (MΦ) which, beyond immunological and housekeeping roles, have been found to electrotonically couple via connexins to cardiomyocytes (CM), stabilising atrio-ventricular conduction at high excitation rates. Here, we characterise structure and electrophysiological function of murine cardiac MΦ and provide a computational model to quantitatively probe the potential relevance of MΦ-CM coupling for cardiac electrophysiology. We find that MΦ are unlikely to have major electrophysiological effects in normal tissue, where they would hasten early and slow late CM-repolarisation. Further work will address potential arrhythmogenicity of MΦ in patho-physiologically remodelled tissue containing elevated MΦ-numbers, incl. non-resident recruited cells.},

 abstract = {This work monitored the effect of a municipal and a village wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) technology on the fate of beta-lactam resistance genes in bacterial populations in different phases of the wastewater treatment process. In case of the municipal WWTP1, the bacteria possessing a high ampicillin resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 20 mg/mL) accumulated in the sedimentation tank, which was accompanied with a higher concentration of ampicillin in the wastewater samples (28.09 ng/L) and an increase in the relative abundance of the blaTEM gene in the bacterial population. However, an opposite trend was revealed with the blaNDM-1 gene, making the sedimentation processes of WWTP1 crucial only for the accumulation of the blaTEM gene. Similarly, the comparison with the WWTP2 showed that the accumulation of the ampicillin resistance in bacterial population probably depended on the WWTP technology and wastewater composition. Out of the four tested resistance genes (blaTEM, blaKPC, blaNDM-1, and blaOXA-48), blaTEM and blaNDM-1 genes were the only two detected in this study. According to NGS analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene, Gammaproteobacteria dominated the ampicillin-resistant bacteria of the WWTP sedimentation tanks. Their relative abundance in the bacterial population also increased during the sedimentation processes in WWTP1. It could indicate the role of the bacterial taxon in ampicillin resistance accumulation in this WWTP and show that only 9.29\% of the original bacterial population from the nitrification tank is involved in the documented shifts in beta-lactam resistance of the bacterial population.},

 abstract = {Abstract The essential splicing factor U2AF65 is known to help anchoring U2 snRNP at the branch site. Its C-terminal UHM domain interacts with ULM motifs of SF3b155, an U2 snRNP protein. Here, we report a cooperative binding of U2AF65 and the related protein CAPERα to the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. In addition, we show that the RS domain of U2AF65 drives a liquid?liquid phase separation that is amplified by intronic RNA with repeated pyrimidine tracts. In cells, knockdown of either U2AF65 or CAPERα improves the inclusion of cassette exons that are preceded by such repeated pyrimidine-rich motifs. These results support a model in which liquid-like assemblies of U2AF65 and CAPERα on repetitive pyrimidine-rich RNA sequences are driven by their RS domains, and facilitate the recruitment of the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. We anticipate that posttranslational modifications and proteins recruited in dynamical U2AF65 and CAPERα condensates may further contribute to the complex mechanisms leading to specific splice site choice that occurs in cells.},

The Baltic Sea is infamous for its annual cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Nodularia spumigena, Aphanizomenon spp., and Dolichospermum spp. that cause harm, especially for recreational users. To broaden our knowledge of the cyanobacterial adaptation strategies for brackish water environments, we sequenced the entire genome of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, a species occurring not only in freshwater environments but also in brackish water. Comparative genomics analyses revealed a close association with Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0090 isolated from a lake in Finland. The genome closure of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315 unraveled a mixture of two subtypes in the original culture, and subtypes exhibited distinct buoyancy phenotypes. Salinity less than 3 g L−1 NaCl enabled proper growth of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, whereas growth was arrested at moderate salinity (6 g L−1 NaCl). The concentrations of toxins, microcystins, increased at moderate salinity, whereas RNA sequencing data implied that Dolichospermum remodeled its primary metabolism in unfavorable high salinity. Based on our results, the predicted salinity decrease in the Baltic Sea may favor toxic blooms of Dolichospermum spp.},

The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing requirements and the statistically driven methods needed to process and understand these ever-growing datasets.Here we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for single-cell RNA-sequencing, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal.The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms.

 abstract = {Sequential developmental events, starting from the moment of fertilization, are crucial for the acquisition of animal body plan. Subtle modifications in such early events are likely to have major impacts in later morphogenesis, bringing along morphological diversification. Here, comparing the blind cave and the surface morphotypes of Astyanax mexicanus fish, we found heterochronies during gastrulation that produce organizer and axial mesoderm tissues with different properties (including differences in the expression of dkk1b) that may have contributed to cavefish brain evolution. These variations observed during gastrulation depend fully on maternal factors. The developmental evolution of retinal morphogenesis and hypothalamic patterning are among those traits that retained significant maternal influence at larval stages. Transcriptomic analysis of fertilized eggs from both morphotypes and reciprocal F1 hybrids showed a strong and specific maternal signature. Our work strongly suggests that maternal effect genes and developmental heterochronies that occur during gastrulation have impacted morphological brain change during cavefish evolution.},

 abstract = {RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of peripheral blood can be a valuable source of information for investigating the status and mechanism of diseases. However, blood contains 50–80\% unwanted hemoglobin (Hb) transcripts. Lexogen’s QuantSeq mRNA-Seq-Kit for Illumina RNA-Seq features a ‘Globin Block’ (GB) module that depletes Hb cDNAs during library preparation. Here, we aimed to assess GB’s effectiveness and checked for technical biases attributable to GB. Using whole blood total RNA samples of 91 healthy individuals, we sequenced 91 pairs of GB and non-blocked samples (noGB) on Illumina HiSeq2500 and 8 pairs of GB/noGB technical replicates on HiSeq4000. GB reduced the fraction of Hb transcripts from 43\% (s.d. 14\%) to 8.0\% (s.d. 4.3\%). From GB samples we detected 1,397 more expressed genes at approximately 11 million reads per RNA-isolate. Enrichment and differential expression analyses did not reveal significant differences for GB and noGB samples with respect to molecular function. In contrast to results from studies that have examined the performance of GB during RNA isolation, we were able to assign GB to corresponding noGB samples (from multiple sequencing runs on HiSeq2500) with at least 89.8\% accuracy from the complete correlation matrix of all GB/GB, noGB/noGB and GB/noGB pairs. However, the use of different sequencers (HiSeq2500 vs HiSeq4000) impaired assignment of technical replicates, whereas assignment of GB to corresponding noGB samples worked perfectly when sequencing on one lane on HiSeq4000. Lexogen’s GB RNA-Seq module is a valuable addition during mRNA-Seq library preparation which works even with low amounts of input total RNA (50 ng per sample). GB facilitated the detection of low abundant transcripts and yielded more non-hemoglobin reads, while preserving biological information. We observed that differences in sequencing run and platform have a far greater effect on technical variation than the use of GB.},

@article{videm_chira_2021,
 abstract = {With the advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, it is possible to determine RNA-RNA interaction and RNA structure predictions on a genome-wide level. The reads from these experiments usually are chimeric, with each arm generated from one of the interaction partners. Owing to short read lengths, often these sequenced arms ambiguously map to multiple locations. Thus, inferring the origin of these can be quite complicated. Here we present ChiRA, a generic framework for sensitive annotation of these chimeric reads, which in turn can be used to predict the sequenced hybrids.Grouping reference loci on the basis of aligned common reads and quantification improved the handling of the multi-mapped reads in contrast to common strategies such as the selection of the longest hit or a random choice among all hits. On benchmark data ChiRA improved the number of correct alignments to the reference up to 3-fold. It is shown that the genes that belong to the common read loci share the same protein families or similar pathways. In published data, ChiRA could detect 3 times more new interactions compared to existing approaches. In addition, ChiRAViz can be used to visualize and filter large chimeric datasets intuitively.ChiRA tool suite provides a complete analysis and visualization framework along with ready-to-use Galaxy workflows and tutorials for RNA-RNA interactome and structurome datasets. Common read loci built by ChiRA can rescue multi-mapped reads on paralogous genes without requiring any information on gene relations. We showed that ChiRA is sensitive in detecting new RNA-RNA interactions from published RNA-RNA interactome datasets.},

@article{villa_data_2021,
 abstract = {Pervasive transcription originating from the ubiquitous activity of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) generates a vast mass of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that represent a potential harm to gene expression. In the compact genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the main genomewide safeguard against pervasive ncRNAs is the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, composed of two RNA-binding proteins (Nrd1 and Nab3) and the helicase Sen1. The NNS complex directs transcription termination of ncRNA genes and promotes the rapid degradation of pervasive transcripts from yeast nuclei through its physical and functional coupling to the nuclear RNA exosome. We have recently shown that inhibition of the exosome in yeast cells leads to the accumulation of ncRNAs complexed with Nab3 and Nrd1, decreasing recycling of these termination factors to sites of transcription and inducing global termination defects at NNS targets. Consistent with the notion that ncRNAs out-titrate Nab3 and Nrd1 termination factors, we have shown that a similar genomewide termination impairment could be achieved by expressing a circular RNA decoy containing a Nab3 binding target [1]. In relation to this previous research article, here we expand our observations on the effect of the circular RNA decoy on NNS termination. We aimed at verifying that the Nab3 binding sequence present on the decoy is indeed efficiently sequestering Nab3 as intended by design, leading to the expected decrease of Nab3 binding on NNS targets. We employed the crosslinking and cDNA analysis protocol (CRAC) on yeast cells expressing the circular ncRNA decoy or a control construct. We present data from high-resolution genomewide RNA binding of Nab3 in three independent biological replicates of these S.cerevisiae cells, normalized by spiked-in S.pombe lysates. These data allow the useful assessment of the extent of co-transcriptional binding decrease of Nab3 by decoy ncRNA titration and will be valuable for further analyses of NNS targeting mechanisms.},

@article{villa_degradation_2020,
 abstract = {A large share of the non-coding transcriptome in yeast is controlled by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which promotes transcription termination of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and by the nuclear exosome, which limits the steady-state levels of the transcripts produced. How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance, and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation.},

 abstract = {Rett syndrome is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is mainly caused by mutations in MECP2. However, mutations in FOXG1 cause a less frequent form of atypical Rett syndrome, called FOXG1 syndrome. FOXG1 is a key transcription factor crucial for forebrain development, where it maintains the balance between progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Using genome-wide small RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics, we identified that FOXG1 affects the biogenesis of miR200b/a/429 and interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, DDX5/p68. Both FOXG1 and DDX5 associate with the microprocessor complex, whereby DDX5 recruits FOXG1 to DROSHA. RNA-Seq analyses of Foxg1cre/+ hippocampi and N2a cells overexpressing miR200 family members identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR2B) as a target of miR200 in neural cells. PRKAR2B inhibits postsynaptic functions by attenuating protein kinase A (PKA) activity; thus, increased PRKAR2B levels may contribute to neuronal dysfunctions in FOXG1 syndrome. Our data suggest that FOXG1 regulates PRKAR2B expression both on transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.},

In this study, we assessed the duration of rectal ESBL- producing E. coli colonisation in the residents, and compare duration of colonisation for ESBL-ST131 versus ESBL-non-ST131.MethodsRectal or faecal samples were obtained from residents of nursing home A between 2013 and 2019 and nursing home B between 2017 and 2019, with repeated point prevalence surveys at intervals of three to six months. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of E. coli were identified on selective culture and selective\&amp;nbsp;enrichment\&amp;nbsp;broth, and examined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In nursing home A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and cluster analyse was performed by respectively O25:ST131-specific PCR and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). In nursing home B whole genome sequencing data were used to determine MLST and to perform a cluster analyse. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed to calculate the median time of rectal colonisation of ESBL-EC with a Log-Rank analysis to test for differences between ESBL-ST131 and ESBL-non-ST131.ResultsA total of 144 residents were included: 84 residents (58\%) with ESBL-ST131 rectal colonisation and 60 residents (42\%) with ESBL-non-ST131 rectal colonisation. Survival analysis showed a median colonisation length of 13 months for ESBL-ST131 (95\%CI: 7,2 – 18,7) versus 8,3 months (95\%CI: 2,8 – 13,8) for ESBL-non-ST131 (p = 0,028). Remarkably, in the subgroup ST131 the median colonisation length was significantly longer in female than in males: 25,7 months versus 8,1 months (p = 0,013).ConclusionHere we found a prolonged colonisation duration of ESBL-ST131 compared to ESBL-non-ST131 in residents of Dutch nursing homes. Prolonged colonisation duration complicates the controlling and ending an ESBL-ST131 outbreak, especially in long stay settings such as nursing homes.\&amp;nbsp;},

@article{winkler_contrast_2020,
 abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables the unbiased characterization of surfaces with respect to their chemical composition. In biological MSI, zones with differentialmass profiles hint towards localized physiological processes, such as the tissue-specific accumulation of secondary metabolites, or diseases, such as cancer. Thus, the efficientdiscovery of ‘regions of interest’ (ROI) is of utmost importance in MSI. However, often the discovery of ROIs is hampered by high background noise and artifact signals. Especially in ambient ionization MSI, unmasking biologically relevant information from crude data sets is challenging. Therefore, we implemented a Threshold Intensity Quantization (TrIQ) algorithm for augmenting the contrast in MSI data visualizations. The simple algorithm reduces the impact of extreme values (‘outliers’) and rescales the dynamic range of mass signals. We provide an R script for post-processing MSI data in the imzML community format (https://bitbucket.org/lababi/msi.r) and implemented the TrIQ in our open-source imaging software RmsiGUI (https://bitbucket.org/lababi/rmsigui/). Applying these programs to different biological MSI data sets demonstrated the universal applicability of TrIQ for improving the contrast in the MSI data visualization. We show that TrIQ improves a subsequent detection of ROIs by sectioning. In addition, the adjustment of the dynamic signal intensity range makes MSI data sets comparable.},

 abstract = {Microalgal biomass is an alternative feedstock for biogas production although its C/N ratio is usually lower than optimal, therefore co-fermentation is recommended. Identification of the core microbiome by metagenome analysis and prediction of functional characteristics are essential to make microalgal feedstock more sustainable and economically feasible. Biogas production from photoautotrophically grown Chlorella vulgaris (Ch. vulgaris) biomass (240 mL CH4 g oTS-1) and co-fermentation with maize silage (330 mL CH4 g oTS-1) has been studied in semi continuous laboratory biogas fermenters. Maize silage control yielded 310 mL CH4 g oTS-1. The microbial community and the read-based functional profiles, derived from these data, were examined during the process by using next-generation metagenome Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The read-based core microbiome consisted of 92 genera from which 60 abundant taxa were directly associated with the microbial methane producing food chain. The data-set was also analyzed in a genome-based approach. 65 bins were assembled, 52 of them belonged in the core biogas producing genera identified by the read-based metagenomes. The read-based and genome-based approaches complemented and verified each other. The functional profiles indicated a variety of glycoside hydrolases. Substantial rearrangements of the methanogen functions have also been observed. Co-fermentation of algal biomass and plant biomass can be carried out for an extended period of time without process failure. The microbial members of the inoculum are well conserved, feedstock composition cause relative abundance changes in the core microbiome.},

 abstract = {Microalgae-based bioenergy production is a promising field with regard to the wide variety of algal species and metabolic potential. The use of liquid wastes as nutrient clearly improves the sustainability of microalgal biofuel production. Microalgae and bacteria have an ecological inter-kingdom relationship. This microenvironment called phycosphere has a major role in the ecosystem productivity and can be utilized both in bioremediation and biomass production. However, knowledge on the effects of indigenous bacteria on microalgal growth and the characteristics of bacterial communities associated with microalgae are limited. In this study municipal, industrial and agricultural liquid waste derivatives were used as cultivation media. Chlorella vulgaris green microalgae and its bacterial partners efficiently metabolized the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content available in these wastes. The read-based metagenomics approach revealed a diverse microbial composition at the start point of cultivations in the different types of liquid wastes. The relative abundance of the observed taxa significantly changed over the cultivation period. The genome-centric reconstruction of phycospheric bacteria further explained the observed correlations between the taxonomic composition and biomass yield of the various waste-based biodegradation systems. Functional profile investigation of the reconstructed microbes revealed a variety of relevant biological processes like organic acid oxidation and vitamin B synthesis. Thus, liquid wastes were shown to serve as valuable resources of nutrients as well as of growth promoting bacteria enabling increased microalgal biomass production.},

 abstract = {The malaria parasite replicates asexually in the red blood cells of its vertebrate host employing epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression in response to changes in its environment. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing in conjunction with RNA sequencing to create an epigenomic and transcriptomic map of the developmental transition from asexual blood stages to male and female gametocytes and to ookinetes in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Across the developmental stages examined, heterochromatin protein 1 associates with variantly expressed gene families localised at subtelomeric regions and variant gene expression based on heterochromatic silencing is observed only in some genes. Conversely, the euchromatin mark histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) is abundant in non-heterochromatic regions across all developmental stages. H3K9ac presents a distinct pattern of enrichment around the start codon of ribosomal protein genes in all stages but male gametocytes. Additionally, H3K9ac occupancy positively correlates with transcript abundance in all stages but female gametocytes suggesting that transcription in this stage is independent of H3K9ac levels. This finding together with known mRNA repression in female gametocytes suggests a multilayered mechanism operating in female gametocytes in preparation for fertilization and zygote development, coinciding with parasite transition from host to vector.},

@article{wolf_corneal_2020,
 abstract = {Purpose
Immune reactions following corneal transplantation are the most common cause of transplant failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of corneal graft rejection are not yet fully understood but increasing evidence points to a crucial role of the innate immune system in this context. Using a human in vitro model, we aimed to assess the response of human macrophages to stimulation with human corneal tissue and whether corneal endothelial cells (CEC) have immune-modulating properties.
Methods
Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). A standardized protocol was used for disaggregation of human corneas into fragments of defined sizes. MDMs were stimulated using processed corneal material with or without CEC. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-gamma (IFNγ) served as controls. RNA sequencing was applied to analyze the impact of differential stimulation of MDMs on their transcriptional profile. RNA sequencing results were validated using digital PCR.
Results
The transcriptional profile of MDMs was significantly modulated by the type of stimulus used for MDM activation as well as by the individual MDM donor. LPS- or IFNγ-stimulation resulted in distinct transcriptional alterations compared to unstimulated MDMs including an upregulation of various cytokines such as CCL3, 4, 5, 19 or CXCL9. Corneal tissue induced the differential expression of 45 genes when compared to unstimulated MDMs, with several metallothioneins (MTs) among the upregulated factors (MT1A, MT1E, MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, MT1L, MT1M, MT1X, MT2A). This effect was independent of the presence or absence of CEC. PCR validation confirmed induction of 3 different metallothioneins (MT1G, MT1H and MT2A) in MDMs stimulated by corneal tissue.
Conclusions
The MDM in vitro model proved to be a robust tool to study the effects of LPS, IFNγ and corneal tissue homogenates on the transcriptional activity of MDM. Human macrophages showed a distinct upregulation of various MTs when challenged with human corneal allogen with or without corneal endothelium, which might have an immune-modulatory effect. As a general observation, it appears that in MDM-based studies a significant donor-dependent effect on the transcriptional profile of MDMs needs to be considered and adjusted before downstream analysis.},

Eight healthy conjunctival specimens served as controls. The TME of CM, as determined by bioinformatic cell type enrichment analysis, was characterized by the enrichment of melanocytes, pericytes and especially various immune cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, B cells and mast cells. Differentially expressed genes between CM and control were mainly involved in inhibition of apoptosis, proteolysis and response to growth factors. POU3F3, BIRC5 and 7 were among the top expressed genes associated with inhibition of apoptosis. 20 genes, among them CENPK, INHA, USP33, CASP3, SNORA73B, AAR2, SNRNP48 and GPN1, were identified as prognostically relevant factors reaching high classification accuracy (area under the curve: 1.0). The present study provides new insights into the TME and the transcriptional profile of CM and additionally identifies new prognostic biomarkers. These results add new diagnostic tools and may lead to new options of targeted therapy for CM.},

 abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important uropathogen that increasingly harbors broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance determinants. Evidence suggests that some same-strain recurrences in women with frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) may emanate from a persistent intravesicular reservoir. Our objective was to analyze K. pneumoniae isolates collected over weeks from multiple body sites of a single patient with recurrent UTI in order to track ordered strain progression across body sites, as has been employed across patients in outbreak settings. Whole-genome sequencing of 26 K. pneumoniae isolates was performed utilizing the Illumina platform. PacBio sequencing was used to create a refined reference genome of the original urinary isolate (TOP52). Sequence variation was evaluated by comparing the 26 isolate sequences to the reference genome sequence. Whole-genome sequencing of the K. pneumoniae isolates from six different body sites of this patient with recurrent UTI demonstrated 100\% chromosomal sequence identity of the isolates, with only a small P2 plasmid deletion in a minority of isolates. No single nucleotide variants were detected. The complete absence of single-nucleotide variants from 26 K. pneumoniae isolates from multiple body sites collected over weeks from a patient with recurrent UTI suggests that, unlike in an outbreak situation with strains collected from numerous patients, other methods are necessary to discern strain progression within a single host over a relatively short time frame.},

@article{yanta_cryptogenotyper_2021,
 abstract = {Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that is transmitted to both humans and animals through zoonotic or anthroponotic means. When a host is infected with this parasite, it causes a gastrointestinal disease known as cryptosporidiosis. To understand the transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium, the small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA and gp60 genes are commonly studied through PCR analysis and conventional Sanger sequencing. However, analyzing sequence chromatograms manually is both time consuming and prone to human error, especially in the presence of poorly resolved, heterozygous peaks and the absence of a validated database. For this study, we developed a Cryptosporidium genotyping tool, called CryptoGenotyper, which has the capability to read raw Sanger sequencing data for the two common Cryptosporidium gene targets (SSU rRNA and gp60) and classify the sequence data into standard nomenclature. The CryptoGenotyper has the capacity to perform quality control and properly classify sequences using a high quality, manually curated reference database, saving users' time and removing bias during data analysis. The incorporated heterozygous base calling algorithms for the SSU rRNA gene target resolves double peaks, therefore recovering data previously classified as inconclusive. The CryptoGenotyper successfully genotyped 99.3\% (428/431) and 95.1\% (154/162) of SSU rRNA chromatograms containing single and mixed sequences, respectively, and correctly subtyped 95.6\% (947/991) of gp60 chromatograms without manual intervention. This new, user-friendly tool can provide both fast and reproducible analyses of Sanger sequencing data for the two most common Cryptosporidium gene targets.},

@article{youssar_intercellular_2019,
 abstract = {Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are a large and diverse group of fungi, which may switch from a saprotrophic to a predatory livestyle if nematodes are present. Different fungi have developed different trapping devices, ranging from adhesive cells to constricting rings. After trapping, fungal hyphae penetrate the worm, secrete lytic enzymes and form a hyphal network inside the body. We sequenced the genome of Duddingtonia flagrans, a biotechnologically important NTF used to control nematode populations in fields. The 36.64 Mb genome encodes 9,927 putative proteins, among which are more than 638 predicted secreted proteins. Most secreted proteins are lytic enzymes, but more than 200 were classified as small secreted proteins ({\textless} 300 amino acids). 117 putative effector proteins were predicted, suggesting interkingdom communication during the colonization. As a first step to analyze the function of such proteins or other phenomena at the molecular level, we developed a transformation system, established the fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry, adapted an assay to monitor protein secretion, and established gene-deletion protocols using homologous recombination or CRISPR/Cas9. One putative effector protein, PefB, was transcriptionally induced during the interaction. We show that the mature protein is able to be imported into nuclei in C. elegans cells. In addition, we studied trap formation and show that cell-to-cell communication is required for ring closure. The availability of the genome sequence and the establishment of many molecular tools will open new avenues to studying this biotechnologically relevant nematode-trapping fungus.},

@article{yu_bromodomain-containing_2021,
 abstract = {Switch defective/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes are multi-subunit machines that play vital roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF complexes recognize their target loci in plants are not fully understood. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana bromodomain-containing proteins BRD1, BRD2, and BRD13 are core subunits of SWI/SNF complexes and critical for SWI/SNF genomic targeting. These three BRDs interact directly with multiple SWI/SNF subunits, including the BRAHMA (BRM) catalytic subunit. Phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses of the brd1 brd2 brd13 triple mutant revealed that these BRDs act largely redundantly to control gene expression and developmental processes that are also regulated by BRM. Genome-wide occupancy profiling demonstrated that these three BRDs extensively colocalize with BRM on chromatin. Simultaneous loss of function of three BRD genes results in reduced BRM protein levels and decreased occupancy of BRM on chromatin across the genome. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the bromodomains of BRDs are essential for genomic targeting of the BRD subunits of SWI/SNF complexes to their target sites. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BRD1, BRD2, and BRD13 are core subunits of SWI/SNF complexes and reveal their biological roles in facilitating genomic targeting of BRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes in plants.},

@article{zavala-alvarado_transcriptional_2020,
 abstract = {Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of the waterborne zoonotic disease leptospirosis. Leptospira are challenged by numerous adverse conditions, including deadly reactive oxygen species (ROS), when infecting their hosts. Withstanding ROS produced by the host innate immunity is an important strategy evolved by pathogenic Leptospira for persisting in and colonizing hosts. In L. interrogans, genes encoding defenses against ROS are repressed by the peroxide stress regulator, PerR. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize both the L. interrogans response to low and high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the PerR regulon. We showed that Leptospira solicit three main peroxidase machineries (catalase, cytochrome C peroxidase and peroxiredoxin) and heme to detoxify oxidants produced during peroxide stress. In addition, canonical molecular chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins from the SOS response were required for Leptospira recovering from oxidative damage. Identification of the PerR regulon upon exposure to H2O2 allowed to define the contribution of this regulator in the oxidative stress response. This study has revealed a PerR-independent regulatory network involving other transcriptional regulators, two-component systems and sigma factors as well as non-coding RNAs that putatively orchestrate, in concert with PerR, the oxidative stress response. We have shown that PerR-regulated genes encoding a TonB-dependent transporter and a two-component system (VicKR) are involved in Leptospira tolerance to superoxide. This could represent the first defense mechanism against superoxide in L. interrogans, a bacterium lacking canonical superoxide dismutase. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenic Leptospira to overcome oxidative damage during infection-related conditions. This will participate in framing future hypothesis-driven studies to identify and decipher novel virulence mechanisms in this life-threatening pathogen.},
