 abstract = {Ecological disasters, wars in regions with microbiological weapons depots, deforestation, domestication of wild animals, consumption of infected animals, contamination of water and food products and their components, experiments with viruses, deficiencies and other defects of the immune system in modern humans and other mammals became the impetus for the evolution of new dangerous and extremely dangerous viruses. Due to the emergence of new dangerous viruses, the importance and demand for knowledge and skills of computational biology, epidemiology and virology in modern society have increased. Modern sequencers are capable of producing large amounts of bioinformatic data that is represented in the form of genomic texts. Comparative сomputational analysis of this information is necessary to clarify the issues of phylogenesis, mutational profiling, molecular evolution, identification of insertions of other genomes, annotation of genome regions, search for targets for vaccine development and pharmacotherapy. In this сontext, authors conducted a computational experiment of comparative analysis of the genomic texts of Belarusian coronavirus samples against a number of selected complete genomes of dangerous and extremely dangerous viruses and coronaviruses of various origins. Data analysis was performed using the YASS, genomic texts were downloaded from the GISAID, the custom genomic data processing pipeline based on the Galaxy bioinformatics platform was also applied. The article presents the results of an analysis of the available scientific literature and the computational experiment comparing the genomic texts of Belarusian coronavirus samples with a number of selected complete genomes of dangerous and especially dangerous viruses and coronaviruses of various origin. A significant similarity of the new coronavirus with the recombinant coronavirus, as well as partial similarity with synthetic coronavirus, Rubella, Ebola 1976, HIV-2 (human immunodeficiency virus), Middle East respiratory syndrome, simian immunodeficiency and Marburg fever viruses have been found.},

 abstract = {As a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a validated receptor for SARS-CoV-2, linking RAS to COVID-19. Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms likely cause an imbalance in the ACE1/ACE2 ratio, triggering RAS imbalance and may contribute to COVID-19 complications. This study aimed to investigate four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE1 and ACE2 genes, three for ACE1 (rs4343, rs4342, rs4341) and one for ACE2 (rs2285666), in patients with COVID-19 among the Palestinian population. A total of 130 blood samples were collected, including 50 negative controls without COVID-19 infection, 50 cases with COVID-19 infection but not hospitalized, and 30 patients with severe COVID-19 infection hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Fragments of the ACE1 and ACE2 genes, including the targeted SNPs, were amplified using multiplex PCR and subsequently genotyped by next-generation sequencing with specific virtual probes. Our results revealed that ACE2 rs2285666 GG genotype carriers were more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group (P=0.049), while no statistical differences were observed in the distribution of ACE1 (rs4343, rs4342, rs4341) variants between COVID-19 patients and the control group. GA carriers of ACE2, rs2285666, among cases and ICU groups were at lower risk of getting COVID-19 infection (P=0.002 and P=0.013, respectively), and they were unlikely to develop fatigue (P=0.043), headache (P=0.007), loss of smell (P=0.028), and dyspnea (P=0.005). Age and comorbidities such as hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 disease. Symptoms of COVID-19 patients such as fatigue, headaches, runny noses, and loss of smell were significantly higher in non-hospitalized cases of COVID-19, while dyspnea was more frequent in the ICU patients. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the ACE2 rs2285666 GG genotype is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This association suggests a potential genetic predisposition linked to the ACE2 gene, which may influence the susceptibility and severity of the disease.},

@article{acebal_embryogenesis_2023,
 abstract = {The calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa (Dana) has attracted interest because of its use as a copepod model organism as well as its potential economic role as live fish larval feed. While the adult genome and transcriptome of A. tonsa has been investigated, no studies have been performed investigating the genome-wide transcriptional changes during the normal subitaneous embryogenesis. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate said transcriptional changes throughout A. tonsa embryonic development. RNA extraction and de novo transcriptome assembly for the subitaneous embryogenesis of the copepod was conducted. The assembly includes for the first-time samples describing quiescent development and overall helps establishing a framework for future studies on the molecular biology of our species of interest. Among the findings reported, sequences annotated to well-known developmental genes, were identified. At the same time are described the molecular changes and gene expression levels throughout the entire 42 h the embryonic development lasts. In conclusion, here we present the most complete genome-wide transcriptional map of early copepod embryonic development to date, enabling further use of A. tonsa as a model organism for crustacean development.

 abstract = {Legumes house nitrogen-fixing endosymbiotic rhizobia in specialized polyploid cells within root nodules, which undergo tightly regulated metabolic activity. By carrying out expression analysis of transcripts over time in Medicago truncatula nodules, we found that the circadian clock enables coordinated control of metabolic and regulatory processes linked to nitrogen fixation. This involves the circadian clock-associated transcription factor LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), with lhy mutants being affected in nodulation. Rhythmic transcripts in root nodules include a subset of nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs) that have the LHY-bound conserved evening element in their promoters. Until now, studies have suggested that NCRs act to regulate bacteroid differentiation and keep the rhizobial population in check. However, these conclusions came from the study of a few members of this very large gene family that has complex diversified spatio-temporal expression. We suggest that rhythmic expression of NCRs may be important for temporal coordination of bacterial activity with the rhythms of the plant host, in order to ensure optimal symbiosis.},

 abstract = {Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) is a marine teleost species with great productive potential worldwide. However, the genomic information currently available for this species in public databases is limited. Such lack of information hinders gene expression assessments that might bring forward novel insights into the physiology, ecology, evolution, and genetics of this potential aquaculture species. In this study, we report the first de novo transcriptome assembly of R. canadum liver, improving the availability of novel gene sequences for this species. Illumina sequencing of liver transcripts generated 1,761,965,794 raw reads, which were filtered into 1,652,319,304 high-quality reads. De novo assembly resulted in 101,789 unigenes and 163,096 isoforms, with an average length of 950.61 and 1,617.34 nt, respectively. Moreover, we found that 126,013 of these transcripts bear potentially coding sequences, and 125,993 of these elements (77.3\%) correspond to functionally annotated genes found in six different databases. We also identified 701 putative ncRNA and 35,414 putative lncRNA. Interestingly, homologues for 410 of these putative lncRNAs have already been observed in previous analyses with Danio rerio, Lates calcarifer, Seriola lalandi dorsalis, Seriola dumerili, or Echeneis naucrates. Finally, we identified 7894 microsatellites related to cobia’s putative lncRNAs. Thus, the information derived from the transcriptome assembly described herein will likely assist future nutrigenomics and breeding programs involving this important fish farming species.},

@article{afouda_culturing_2020,
 abstract = {Long considered to be a consequence of human antibiotics use by deduction, antibiotic resistance mechanisms appear to be in fact a much older phenomenon as antibiotic resistance genes have previously been detected from millions of year-old permafrost samples. As these specimens guarantee the viability of archaic bacteria, we herein propose to apply the culturomics approach to recover the bacterial content of a Siberian permafrost sample dated, using the in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclide chlorine36 (36Cl), at 2.7 million years to study the dynamics of bacterial evolution in an evolutionary perspective. As a result, we cultured and sequenced the genomes of 28 ancient bacterial species including one new species. To perform genome comparison between permafrost strains and modern isolates we selected 7 of these species (i.e., Achromobacter insolitus, Bacillus idriensis, Brevundimonas aurantiaca, Janibacter melonis, Kocuria rhizophila, Microbacterium hydrocarbonoxydans and Paracoccus yeei). We observed a high level of variability in genomic content with a percentage of shared genes in the core genomes ranging from 21.23\% to 55.59\%. In addition, the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) comparison between permafrost and modern strains for the same species did not allow a dating of ancient strains based on genomic content. There were no significant differences in antibiotic resistance profiles between modern and ancient isolates of each species. Acquired resistance to antibiotics was phenotypically detected in all gram-negative bacterial species recovered from permafrost, with a significant number of genes coding for antibiotic resistance detected. Taken together, these findings confirm previously obtained data that antibiotic resistance predates humanity as most of antimicrobial agents are natural weapons used in inter-microbial conflicts within the biosphere.},

This study focuses on the use of Trametes sanguinea LSR01 and Trametes villosa LSR02, two indigenous fungal species isolated from Argentina, for the production of biofoams from brewery waste. These biofoams were obtained with an average density of 0.30 g cm-3, Young's modulus around 1 MPa and a compressive stress around 19 MPa.  This study also evaluated the variation of laccase activity during each stage of the biofoam production process. Unexpectedly, residual laccase activity was detected in the biofoams after oven drying (60, 80 and 100 °C). This residual laccase ability to oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde indicated that biofoams are not enzymatically inert.  This unexpected finding highlights the enzymatic potential of these mycelium-based materials and positions them as promising green catalysts for biotechnological endeavors.},

To access this biosynthetic potential for biotechnological applications, deeper insights into the biosynthetic pathways and corresponding gene clusters are necessary. Here we provide a comprehensive view of the biosynthetic gene clusters of all organisms comprising a lichen thallus: fungi, green algae, and bacteria. We present two high-quality PacBio metagenomes, in which we identified a total of 460 biosynthetic gene clusters. Lichen mycobionts yielded 73–114 clusters, other lichen associated ascomycetes 8–40, green algae of the genus Trebouxia 14–19, and lichen-associated bacteria 101–105 clusters. The mycobionts contained mainly T1PKSs, followed by NRPSs, and terpenes; Trebouxia reads harbored mainly clusters linked to terpenes, followed by NRPSs and T3PKSs. Other lichen-associated ascomycetes and bacteria contained a mix of diverse biosynthetic gene clusters. In this study, we identified for the first time the biosynthetic gene clusters of entire lichen holobionts. The yet untapped biosynthetic potential of two species of the genus Hypogymnia is made accessible for further research.},

To reveal its genetic variation and population structure, microsatellite markers were developed and validated in four Greek populations. Methods and Results RNA-Seq data of the related species Arnebia euchroma and Echium plantagineum were assembled and mined to identify conserved ortholog sets containing simple sequence repeat motifs. Fifty potential loci were identified and then tested on A. tinctoria, of which 17 loci were polymorphic. The number of alleles ranged from one to nine, and the levels of observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.000 to 1.000 and 0.000 to 0.820, respectively. Most of these loci could be successfully amplified in eight other species of Boraginaceae (Alkanna graeca, A. hellenica, A. sfikasiana, Echium vulgare, E. plantagineum, Lithospermum officinale, Borago officinalis, and Anchusa officinalis). Conclusions This study provides the first set of microsatellite loci for studying the genetic variation and population structure of A. tinctoria and shows their potential usefulness in other Boraginaceae species.},

However, colistin is still widely used in intensive poultry production in Bangladesh. We aimed to investigate the dynamics and genetic diversity of colistin-resistant commensal Escherichia coli from broiler chickens. A total of 1200 E. coli strains were characterized from 20 broiler farms at three-time points along the production period. All strains were screened for mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes by a multiplex PCR, and their genetic diversity was measured by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR fingerprinting. Genomic diversity and characterization were performed by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Twenty-five percent of the commensal E. coli strains harbored mcr-1 genes. Frequency of mcr-1 gene detection correlated positively (odds ratio 1.71; 95\% CI 0.96–3.06; p = 0.068) with the use of colistin in poultry flocks. REP-PCR profiles and WGS analysis showed diverse E. coli population carrying multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. Phylogenetic comparison of mcr-1-bearing strains recovered from this study with a global strain collection revealed wide phylogenetic relationship. This study identified a high prevalence of mcr-1 gene among genetically diverse E. coli populations from broiler chickens in Bangladesh suggesting a massive horizontal spread of mcr-1 rather than by clonal expansion.},

@article{akol_multimodal_2023,
 abstract = {Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) has important functions in neuronal differentiation and balances excitatory/inhibitory network activity. Thus far, molecular processes underlying FOXG1 function are largely unexplored. Here, we present a multiomics data set exploring how FOXG1 impacts neuronal maturation at the chromatin level in the mouse hippocampus. At a genome-wide level, FOXG1 i) both represses and activates transcription, ii) binds mainly to enhancer regions, iii) reconfigures the epigenetic landscape through bidirectional alteration of H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and chromatin accessibility, and iv) operates synergistically with NEUROD1. Interestingly, we could not detect a clear hierarchy of FOXG1 and NEUROD1, but instead, provide the evidence that they act in a highly cooperative manner to control neuronal maturation. Genes affected by the chromatin alterations impact synaptogenesis and axonogenesis. Inhibition of histone deacetylases partially rescues transcriptional alterations upon FOXG1 reduction. This integrated multiomics view of changes upon FOXG1 reduction reveals an unprecedented multimodality of FOXG1 functions converging on neuronal maturation.

 abstract = {Xylanases are the main enzymes to hydrolyze xylan, the major hemicellulose found in lignocellulose. Xylanases also have a wide range of industrial applications. Therefore, the discovery of new xylanases has the potential to enhance efficiency and sustainability in many industries. Here, we report a xylanase with thermophilic character and superior biochemical properties for industrial use. The new xylanase is discovered in Anoxybacillus ayderensis as an intracellular xylanase (AAyXYN329) and recombinantly produced. While AAyXYN329 shows significant activity over a wide pH and temperature range, optimum activity conditions were determined as pH 6.5 and 65 °C. The half-life of the enzyme was calculated as 72 h at 65 °C. The enzyme did not lose activity between pH 6.0–9.0 at +4 °C for 75 days. Km, kcat and kcat/Km values of AAyXYN329 were calculated as 4.09824 ± 0.2245 μg/μL, 96.75 1/sec, and 23.61/L/g.s −1, respectively. In conclusion, the xylanase of A. ayderensis has an excellent potential to be utilized in many industrial processes.},

 abstract = {Water quality testing does not recognise antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and is often limited to indicators of faecal contamination Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species. In Europe, data on AMR in drinking water is scarce. In Ireland, as in many countries, household drinking water is supplied via mains or via private wells or water schemes. Using citizen science, we identified Irish private drinking water supplies as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB). Gram-negative (n = 464) and Gram-positive (n = 72) bacteria were isolated. We identified instances of potentially opportunistic ARB such as Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus species. We report reservoirs of multidrug resistance in Enterococcus casseliflavus, E. cloacae, E. coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Serratia rubidaea. We also identified linezolid-resistant Enterococcus in Irish drinking water. Linezolid is a last-resort antibiotic used to treat vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. Additionally, we identified mobile AMR in three water samples, two of which were carried on IncF group, one on IncQ and five on Col-like plasmids. Our work suggests that private drinking water is a potential sink and source of AMR pathogens. This highlights a value of drinking water surveillance in a One Health framework as the surveillance would provide information regarding the movement and persistence of ARB and ARGs that are able to survive in drinking water and subsequently have the opportunity to be mobilised through humans; linking the environment to the human and potentially threatening human health.},

 abstract = {DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates chromatin structure and the cell-type-specific expression of genes. The association of aberrant DNA methylation with many diseases, as well as the increasing interest in modifying the methylation mark in a directed manner at genomic sites using epigenome editing for research and therapeutic purposes, increases the need for easy and efficient DNA methylation analysis methods. The standard approach to analyze DNA methylation with a single-cytosine resolution is bisulfite conversion of DNA followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In this chapter, we describe a robust, powerful, and cost-efficient protocol for the amplification of target regions from bisulfite-converted DNA, followed by a second PCR step to generate libraries for Illumina NGS. In the two consecutive PCR steps, first, barcodes are added to individual amplicons, and in the second PCR, indices and Illumina adapters are added to the samples. Finally, we describe a detailed bioinformatics approach to extract DNA methylation levels of the target regions from the sequencing data. Combining barcodes with indices enables a high level of multiplexing allowing to sequence multiple pooled samples in the same sequencing run. Therefore, this method is a robust, accurate, quantitative, and cheap approach for the readout of DNA methylation patterns at defined genomic regions.},

This study aimed to develop a comprehensive early life stage toxicity pathway model for the exposure of fish to estrogenic chemicals that is rooted in mechanistic toxicology. Embryo-larval fathead minnows (FHM; Pimephales promelas) were exposed to graded concentrations of 17α-ethinylestradiol (water control, 0.01\% DMSO, 4, 20, and 100 ng/L) for 32 days. Fish were assessed for transcriptomic and proteomic responses at 4 days post-hatch (dph), and for histological and apical end points at 28 dph. Molecular analyses revealed core responses that were indicative of observed apical outcomes, including biological processes resulting in overproduction of vitellogenin and impairment of visual development. Histological observations indicated accumulation of proteinaceous fluid in liver and kidney tissues, energy depletion, and delayed or suppressed gonad development. Additionally, fish in the 100 ng/L treatment group were smaller than controls. Integration of omics data improved the interpretation of perturbations in early life stage FHM, providing evidence of conservation of toxicity pathways across levels of biological organization. Overall, the mechanism-based embryo-larval FHM model showed promise as a replacement for standard adult live animal tests.},

However, the comprehensive molecular mechanisms of these effects are yet to be elucidated. The current study investigated the transcriptomic changes induced by seaweed extracts derived from Sargassum vulgare and Acanthophora spicifera on tomato and sweet pepper plants. Tomato and sweet pepper plants were subjected to foliar treatment with alkaline extracts prepared from the above seaweeds. Transcriptome changes in the plants were assessed 72h after treatments using RNA-sequencing. The treated plants were also analysed for defense enzyme activities, nutrient composition and phytohormonal profiles. The results showed the significant enrichment of genes associated with several growth and defense processes including photosynthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, secondary metabolite metabolism, MAPK signaling, and amino acid biosynthesis. Activities of defense enzymes were also significantly increased in SWE-treated plants. Plant nutrient profiling showed significant increases in calcium, potassium, nitrogen, sulphur, boron, copper, iron, manganese, zinc, and phosphorous levels in seaweed-extract treated plants. Furthermore, the levels of auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins were also significantly increased in the treated plants. In addition to these observed effects, were also significant disease reductions of bacterial leaf spot and early blight in SWE-treated plants coupled with an increase in chlorophyll content, plant growth, and fruit yield. The results demonstrated the complex effect of S. vulgare and A. spicifera extracts on the plants’ transcriptome and provide evidence of a strong role of these extracts in increasing plant growth responses while priming the plants against pathogenic attack simultaneously. The current study contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of seaweed extracts in plants and helps their usage as a viable organic input for sustainable crop production.},

The activities of defence enzymes were also significantly enhanced by seaweed extract treatment. Furthermore, AN-SWE treated tomato plants had significantly higher chlorophyll and growth hormone content and showed improved plant growth parameters and nutrient profiles than the control. It is postulated that seaweed extract-induced gene regulation was responsible for favourable plant responses that enabled better growth and tolerance to stress conditions. This study provides evidence at the transcriptomic level for the positive effects of foliar application of the Ascophyllum nodosum extract (Stimplex) observed in treated tomato plants.},

@article{aljindan_phenomics_2024,
 abstract = {Background
Enterococcus avium (E. avium) is a Gram-positive nosocomial pathogen that is commonly isolated from the alimentary tract. The objective of this functional genomics study was to identify the resistant genes by analyzing the genome of E. avium IRMC1622a, a type of bacteria found in feces collected from a patient at a Saudi Arabian tertiary hospital.
Methods
The bacterial strain IRMC1622a was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as Enterococcus sp. The resistance phenomics were performed using VITEK® 2, and morphological analysis was achieved using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, the whole bacterial genome of the bacterial strain IRMC1622a was subjected to sequencing during October 2023 using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technology, and mining for resistant genes.
Results
The results of antimicrobial resistant phenomics indicated that the IRMC1622a strain was sensitive to all tested antimicrobial agents except for erythromycin, and the same result was confirmed by genomic analysis in addition to other classes of antibiotics. SEM showed E. avium IRMC1622a is ovoid shape, in single cells (L 1.2797 ± 0.1490µm), in pairs (L 1.7333 ± 0.1054µm), and in chains (L 2.44033 ± 0.1978 µm). The E. avium IRMC1622a genome has 14 (in CARD) antimicrobial resistance genes that were identified with several mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, such as the efflux pump and conferring antibiotic resistance. The present study revealed that the E. avium IRMC1622a genome contains a high number of genes associated with virulence factors, and 14 matched pathogenic protein families and predicted as human pathogen (probability score 0.855). We report two (ISEnfa4 and ISEfa5) mobile genetic elements for the first time in the E. avium genome.
Conclusions
The study concludes that E. avium IRMC1622a is susceptible to all tested antibacterials except erythromycin. The IRMC1622a has 14 genes encoding antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, including the efflux pump and conferring antibiotic resistance. This could indicate a potential rise in E. avium resistance in healthcare facilities. These observations may raise concerns regarding E. avium resistance in healthcare. We need more research to understand the pathophysiology of E. avium, which leads to hospital-acquired infections.},

So far, specific PCR-based detection and identification tests for X. translucens pathovars are not available. In this study, we used comparative genomics approach to design a pathovar-specific primer pair for detection of X. translucens pv. undulosa in naturally infected seeds and its differentiation from other pathovars of the species. For this aim, complete genome sequences of strains of different X. translucens pathovars were compared and the specific PCR primer pair XtuF/XtuR was designed. These primers were strictly specific to X. translucens pv. undulosa as the expected 229 bp DNA fragment was not amplified in the closely-related pathovars nor in other xanthomonads, wheat pathogenic bacteria, and other plant pathogenic bacteria. High sensitivity of the primer pair XtuF/XtuR allowed detection of pure DNA of the pathogen in a concentration as low as 4.5 pg/µl. The pathogen was also detected in water suspension at a concentration of 8.6 × 102 cfu/ml. The PCR test was capable of detecting the pathogen in extracts of naturally infected wheat seeds at a concentration of 3.5 × 104 cfu/g while culture plate method was able to detect the pathogen at a concentration of 50 × 105 cfu/g of the same seeds. The PCR test developed in this study is a step forward for precise detection and identification of X. translucens pv. undulosa to prevent outbreaks of the bacterial leaf streak disease.},

This study provides an in-depth look into the distribution and variety of prophages in Latilactobacillus curvatus (L. curvatus). This species is found in a wide variety of ecological niches and is routinely used as a meat starter culture., 
Methods: Fourty five L. curvatus genomes were screened for prophages. The intact predicted prophages and their chromosomal integration loci were described. Six L. curvatus lysogens were analysed for phage-mediated lysis post induction via UV light and/or mitomycin C. Their lysates were analysed for phage particles via viral DNA sequencing and transmission electron microscopy., 
Results: Two hundred and six prophage sequences of any completeness were detected within L. curvatus genomes. The 50 as intact predicted prophages show high levels of genetic diversity on an intraspecies level with conserved regions mostly in the replication and head/tail gene clusters. Twelve chromosomal loci, mostly tRNA genes, were identified, where intact L. curvatus phages were integrated. The six analysed L. curvatus lysogens showed strain-dependent lysis in various degrees after induction, yet only four of their lysates appeared to contain fully assembled virions with the siphovirus morphotype., 
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that L. curvatus is a (pro)phage-susceptible species, harbouring multiple intact prophages and remnant sequences thereof. This knowledge provides a basis to study phage-host interaction influencing microbial communities in food fermentations.},

There are limited comparative genomic studies involving Brucella strains that explore the relatedness among both species. In this study, we involved strains (n=44) representing standard, vaccine and Indian field origin for pangenome, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and phylogenetic analysis. Both species shared a common gene pool representing 2884 genes out of a total 3244 genes. SNP-based phylogenetic analysis indicated higher SNP diversity among B. melitensis (3824) strains in comparison to B. abortus (540) strains, and a clear demarcation was identified between standard/vaccine and field strains. The analysis for virulence genes revealed that virB3, virB7, ricA, virB5, ipx5, wbkC, wbkB, and acpXL genes were highly conserved in most of the Brucella strains. Interestingly, virB10 gene was found to have high variability among the B. abortus strains. The cgMLST analysis revealed distinct sequence types for the standard/vaccine and field strains. B. abortus strains from north-eastern India fall within similar sequence type differing from other strains. In conclusion, the analysis revealed a highly shared core genome among two Brucella species. SNP analysis revealed B. melitensis strains exhibit high diversity as compared to B. abortus strains. Strains with absence or high polymorphism of virulence genes can be exploited for the development of novel vaccine candidates effective against both B. abortus and B. melitensis.},

The MR-6/3H strain was resistant to 19 antimicrobials among 23 tested, including all aminoglycosides, phenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and almost all β-lactams. Phylogenetically, the MR-6/3H was close to clinical origin strains, including those previously isolated in Russia. Comparative genomics revealed the presence of putative antimicrobial resistance genes in the MR-6/3H isolate, mostly associated with efflux systems. Notably, genus-specific OXA-926-like β-lactamase was also detected. In all, 27 putative virulence factors were predicted, the majority of which were associated with motility, adherence, stress survival, siderophore synthesis, and immunomodulation. In the MR-6/3H genome, the five prophage regions were identified, including two with intact levels. Integrons and CRISPR-Cas systems were not detected in the MR-6/3H isolate.

 abstract = {The bacterial foodborne enteropathogen Escherichia albertii, despite enjoying increased attention paid to its pathogenesis, global dissemination, and antimicrobial resistance capacity, remains difficult to identify from human foods. The primary objective of this study was to develop and test a selective and differential plating medium for the isolation of E. albertii from enteric pathogens commonly transmitted via fresh poultry meat, namely E. coli and Salmonella enterica. MacConkey agar supplemented with α-D-+-melibiose and the lactose analogue X-gal was prepared and used to differentially enumerate E. albertii, Salmonella, and E. coli from inoculated ground chicken meat. The medium, MXgMac agar, differentiated the inoculated pathogens with a greater degree of efficiency than did the previously developed E. albertii-selective medium xylose–rhamnose–melibiose (XRM) MacConkey agar, based on differential usage of the lactose analogue and melibiose. Chicken-derived feces and litter samples were subsequently tested using the medium and found not to contain E. albertii by 16S rRNA gene amplification. MXgMac agar facilitates improved differential recovery of E. albertii and other enteric pathogens from poultry meat versus other E. albertii selective/differential media.},

 abstract = {Dairy products play a crucial role in human nutrition as they provide essential nutrients. However, the presence of diverse microorganisms in these products can pose challenges to food safety and quality. Here, we provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of a diverse collection of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and staphylococci isolated from raw sheep’s milk. Whole-genome sequencing, phenotypic characterization, and bioinformatics were employed to gain insight into the genetic composition and functional attributes of these bacteria. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of various genetic elements. Important toxin-related genes in staphylococci that contribute to their pathogenic potential were identified and confirmed using phenotypic assays, while adherence-related genes, which are essential for attachment to host tissues, surfaces in the dairy environment, and the creation of biofilms, were also present. Interestingly, the Staphylococcus aureus isolates belonged to sequence type 5, which largely consists of methicillin-susceptible isolates that have been involved in severe nosocomial infections. Although genes encoding methicillin resistance were not identified, multiple resistance genes (RGs) conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, and fluroquinolones were found. In contrast, LAB had few inherently present RGs and no virulence genes, suggesting their likely safe status as food additives in dairy products. LAB were also richer in bacteriocins and carbohydrate-active enzymes, indicating their potential to suppress pathogens and effectively utilize carbohydrate substrates, respectively. Additionally, mobile genetic elements, present in both LAB and staphylococci, may facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of genetic traits, including RGs, virulence genes, and metabolic factors, with implications for food quality and public health. The molecular and phenotypic characterization presented herein contributes to the effort to mitigate risks and infections (e.g., mastitis) and enhance the safety and quality of milk and products thereof.},

 abstract = {Insects harbour diverse maternally inherited bacteria and viruses, some of which have evolved to kill the male progeny of their hosts (male killing: MK). The fly species Drosophila biauraria carries a maternally transmitted MK-inducing partiti-like virus, but it was unknown if it carries other MK-inducing endosymbionts. Here, we identified two male-killing Wolbachia strains (wBiau1 and wBiau2) from D. biauraria and compared their genomes to elucidate their evolutionary processes. The two strains were genetically closely related but had exceptionally different genome structures with considerable rearrangements compared with combinations of other Wolbachia strains. Despite substantial changes in the genome structure, the two Wolbachia strains did not experience gene losses that would disrupt the male-killing expression or persistence in the host population. The two Wolbachia-infected matrilines carried distinct mitochondrial haplotypes, suggesting that wBiau1 and wBiau2 have invaded D. biauraria independently and undergone considerable genome changes owing to unknown selective pressures in evolutionary history. This study demonstrated the presence of three male-killers from two distinct origins in one fly species and highlighted the diverse and rapid genome evolution of MK Wolbachia in the host.},

 abstract = {The first reports of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales in our hospital date back to 2006. In that period, few ertapenem-resistant but meropenem-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonging to sequence type (ST) 37 were retrieved from clinical samples. These strains produced the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum β-lactamase, OmpK35 was depleted due to a nonsense mutation, and a novel OmpK36 variant was identified. Yet, starting from 2010, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing ST512 isolates started prevailing and ST37 vanished from sight. Since 2018 the clinical use of the combination of ceftazidime–avibactam (CZA) has been introduced in clinical practice for the treatment of bacteria producing serine-β-lactamases, but KPC-producing, CZA-resistant K. pneumoniae are emerging. In 2021, four CZA-resistant ST37 isolates producing KPC variants were isolated from the same number of patients. blaKPC gene cloning in Escherichia coli was used to define the role of those KPC variants on CZA resistance, and whole genome sequencing was performed on these isolates and on three ST37 historical isolates from 2011. CZA resistance was due to mutations in the blaKPC genes carried on related pKpQIL-type plasmids, and three variants of the KPC enzyme have been identified in the four ST37 strains. The four ST37 isolates were closely related to each other and to the historical isolates, suggesting that ST37 survived without notice in our hospital for 10 years, waiting to re-emerge as a CZA-resistant K. pneumoniae clone. The ancestor of these contemporary isolates derives from ST37 wild-type porin strains, with no other mutations in chromosomal genes involved in conferring antibiotic resistance (parC, gyrA, ramR, mgrB, pmrB).},

One of these strains reached high levels of resistance to both CZA and carbapenems and carried two copies of blaKPC-3 and one copy of blaKPC-31 located on plasmid pKpQIL. The genomes and plasmids of CZA-resistant ST307 strains were analyzed to identify the molecular mechanisms leading to the evolution of resistance and compared with ST307 genomes at local and global levels. A complex pattern of multiple plasmids in rearranged configurations, coresident within the CZA-carbapenem–resistant K. pneumoniae strain, was observed. Characterization of these plasmids revealed recombination and segregation events explaining why K. pneumoniae isolates from the same patient had different antibiotic resistance profiles. This study illustrates the intense genetic plasticity occurring in ST307, one of the most worldwide-diffused K. pneumoniae high-risk clones.},

However, direct comparison of hepatocyte models is currently challenging. We systematically searched the literature and compared different HLCs, but reported functions were limited to a small subset of hepatic functions. To enable a more comprehensive comparison, we developed an algorithm to compare transcriptomic data across studies that tested HLCs derived from hepatocytes, biliary cells, fibroblasts, and pluripotent stem cells, alongside primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). This revealed that no HLC covered the complete hepatic transcriptome, highlighting the importance of HLC selection. HLCs derived from hepatocytes had the highest transcriptional resemblance to PHHs regardless of the protocol, whereas the quality of fibroblasts and PSC derived HLCs varied depending on the protocol used. Finally, we developed and validated a web application (HLCompR) enabling comparison for specific pathways and addition of new HLCs. In conclusion, our comprehensive transcriptomic comparison of HLCs allows selection of HLCs for specific research questions and can guide improvements in culturing conditions.},

Thus, the identification of an improved class of inhibitors of PBP3 and PBP5 is imperative, and in this study, phenolics due to their promising antibacterial activities were screened using structure−based pharmacophore and molecular docking approaches against PBP3, and the ability of the lead phenolics to modulate PBP3 and PBP5 was studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The results demonstrated various inhibitory capacities of the lead phenolics, with lysidicichin (−41.66 kcal/mol) and silicristin (−31.11 kcal/mol) being the most potent against PBP3, while epicatechin 3-O-(3-O-methylgallate) (−38.97 kcal/mol) and epigallocatechin-4-benzyl thioether (−37.01 kcal/mol) had higher affinities towards PBP5. Overall, epicatechin gallate had the best broad-spectrum of activity, as the compound was able to bind favourably to both targets. Additionally, the thermodynamic information confirmed the stability of the lead phenolics with both targets. Conclusively, while these observations are suggestive of the modulatory role of the lead phenolics on the growth of E. coli, further in vitro and in vivo validation of the activity elicited by the phenolics in this study is imperative, and efforts are underway in this direction.},

Thus, the development of new modulators with enhanced binding of PBP2x is highly encouraged. In this study, phenolics, due to their reported antibacterial activities, were screened against the active site of PBP2x using structure-based pharmacophore and molecular docking techniques, and the ability of the top-hit phenolics to inhibit the active and allosteric sites of PBP2x was refined through 120 ns molecular dynamic simulation. Except for gallocatechin gallate and lysidicichin, respectively, at the active and allosteric sites of PBP2x, the top-hit phenolics had higher negative binding free energy (ΔGbind) than amoxicillin [active site (− 19.23 kcal/mol), allosteric site (− 33.75 kcal/mol)]. Although silicristin had the best broad-spectrum effects at the active (− 38.41 kcal/mol) and allosteric (− 50.54 kcal/mol) sites of PBP2x, the high thermodynamic entropy (4.90 Å) of the resulting complex might suggest the need for its possible structural refinement for enhanced potency. Interestingly, silicristin had a predicted synthetic feasibility score of {\textless} 5 and quantum calculations using the DFT B3LYP/6-31G+ (dp) revealed that silicristin is less stable and more reactive than amoxicillin. These findings point to the possible benefits of the top-hit phenolics, and most especially silicristin, in the direct and synergistic treatment of infections caused by S. pneumoniae. Accordingly, silicristin is currently the subject of further confirmatory in vitro research.},

 abstract = {Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide worldwide as part of arthropods' exoskeletons and fungal cell walls. Low concentrations in soils and sediments indicate rapid decomposition through chitinolytic organisms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The enacting enzymes, so‐called chitinases, and their products, chitooligosaccharides, exhibit promising characteristics with applications ranging from crop protection to cosmetics, medical, textile, and wastewater industries. Exploring novel chitinolytic organisms is crucial to expand the enzymatical toolkit for biotechnological chitin utilization and to deepen our understanding of diverse catalytic mechanisms. In this study, we present two long‐read sequencing‐based genomes of highly similar Jeongeupia species, which have been screened, isolated, and biochemically characterized from chitin‐amended soil samples. Through metabolic characterization, whole‐genome alignments, and phylogenetic analysis, we could demonstrate how the investigated strains differ from the taxonomically closest strain Jeongeupia naejangsanensis BIO‐TAS4‐2T (DSM 24253). In silico analysis and sequence alignment revealed a multitude of highly conserved chitinolytic enzymes in the investigated Jeongeupia genomes. Based on these results, we suggest that the two strains represent a novel species within the genus of Jeongeupia, which may be useful for environmentally friendly N‐acetylglucosamine production from crustacean shell or fungal biomass waste or as a crop protection agent., In this study, a novel chitinolytic Jeongeupia species “wiesaeckerbachi” was isolated from soil samples, characterized biochemically, and sequenced with the long‐read platform PacBio Sequel IIe. In silico analysis unraveled genomic differences to the closest related type strain Jeongeupia naejangsanensis TAS4‐2 in addition to an usually extensive chitinolytic machinery.},

 abstract = {The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the ventral hypothalamus, synchronizes and maintains daily cellular and physiological rhythms across the body, in accordance with environmental and visceral cues. Consequently, the systematic regulation of spatiotemporal gene transcription in the SCN is vital for daily timekeeping. So far, the regulatory elements assisting circadian gene transcription have only been studied in peripheral tissues, lacking the critical neuronal dimension intrinsic to the role of the SCN as central brain pacemaker. By using histone-ChIP-seq, we identified SCN-enriched gene regulatory elements that associated with temporal gene expression. Based on tissue-specific H3K27ac and H3K4me3 marks, we successfully produced the first-ever SCN gene-regulatory map. We found that a large majority of SCN enhancers not only show robust 24-h rhythmic modulation in H3K27ac occupancy, peaking at distinct times of day, but also possess canonical E-box (CACGTG) motifs potentially influencing downstream cycling gene expression. To establish enhancer–gene relationships in the SCN, we conducted directional RNA-seq at six distinct times across the day and night, and studied the association between dynamically changing histone acetylation and gene transcript levels. About 35\% of the cycling H3K27ac sites were found adjacent to rhythmic gene transcripts, often preceding the rise in mRNA levels. We also noted that enhancers encompass noncoding, actively transcribing enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in the SCN, which in turn oscillate, along with cyclic histone acetylation, and correlate with rhythmic gene transcription. Taken together, these findings shed light on genome-wide pretranscriptional regulation operative in the central clock that confers its precise and robust oscillation necessary to orchestrate daily timekeeping in mammals.},

As a result, we are confronted with a growing landscape of tools, while standards for reproducibility and benchmarking lag behind. This work identifies the challenges for reproducible RNA analysis, and highlights best practices on the processing and dissemination of scientific results. We found that the success of a tool does not solely depend on its performances: equally important is how a tool is received, and then supported within a community. This leads us to a detailed presentation of the RNA workbench, a community effort for sharing workflows and processing tools, built on top of the Galaxy framework. Here, we follow the community guidelines to extend its portfolio of RNA tools with the integration of the TriplexRNA (https://triplexrna.org). Our findings provide the basis for the development of a recommendation system, to guide users in the choice of tools and workflows.},

Although functional roles of eRNAs in the pathophysiology of neoplasms have been reported, their involvement in gastric cancer (GC) is less known. Materials \& methods: A network-based integrative approach was utilized for analyzing transcriptome and epigenome alterations in GC, and an eRNA was selected for experimental validation. Survival analysis and clinicopathological associations were also performed. Results: A hub eRNA, ENSR00000272060, showed significantly increased expression in tumor versus nontumor tissues, as well as an association with clinicopathological features. A seven-gene prognostic model was also constructed. Conclusion: The constructed network provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes implicated in the progression of GC, along with a starting point from which to derive potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers.},

The current investigation emphasizes on in-silico identification and comparative analysis of different fungal lactases present in Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus oryzae, Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium fujikuroi. Prediction of motifs and domains, chromosomal positioning, gene structure, gene ontology, sub-cellular localization and protein modeling were performed using different bioinformatics tools to have an insight into the structural and functional characteristics of β-galactosidases. Evolutionary and homology relationships were established by phylogenetic and synteny analyses. A total of 14 β-gal genes (GH-35) were identified in these species. Identified lactases, having 5 domains, were predicted to be stable, acidic, non-polar and extracellularly localized with roles in polysaccharide catabolic process. Results showed variable exonic/intronic ratios of the gene structures which were randomly positioned on chromosomes. Moreover, synteny blocks and close evolutionary relationships were observed between Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus oryzae. Structural insights allowed the prediction of best protein models based on the higher ERRAT and Q-MEAN values. And RNA-sequencing analysis, performed on A. fumigatus, elucidated the role of β-gal in germ tube development. This study would pave the way for efficient fungal lactase production as it identified β-gal genes and predicted their various features and also it would provide a road-way to further the understanding of A. fumigatus pathogenicity via the expression insights of β-gal in germ tube development.},

@phdthesis{baldwin_evaluating_2019,
 abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate pesticide used extensively in Canada and around the world. Due to its highly conserved mechanism of action involving inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), CPF has the ability to exert toxicity on non-target species in aquatic systems. In fish species, exposure to CPF has been associated with a range of adverse effects across physiological endpoints including abnormal development, inhibition of AChE, immunomodulation, and molecular level effects such as altered expression of specific genes and global transcriptomes. However, the literature on amphibians exposed to CPF is not as extensive despite the known global declines of amphibian species and the hypothesized links between these declines and anthropogenic pesticide contamination of aquatic systems worldwide. The overall objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the sub-lethal effects of CPF exposure on the model amphibian, Xenopus laevis, across levels of biological organization from molecular to whole animal. 
The first study (Chapter 2) examined the molecular toxicity pathways and mechanisms of toxicity after short-term exposure of early life-stage (ELS) X. laevis to CPF using whole body transcriptome analyses. The ELS transcriptomic responses were then compared to apical outcomes of chronic exposure to CPF to determine if identified dysregulated pathways could provide early indicators of these adverse outcomes. Post-hatch individuals were exposed to nominal CPF concentrations of 0.4, 2, or 10 μg L-1. A subset of individuals were sampled at 96 hours (h) for whole-body transcriptomic analysis and remaining individuals were transferred to tanks for long-term exposure through to metamorphic climax ({\textasciitilde} 75 days). Pathway analysis revealed dysregulated pathways that were related to outcomes known to be associated with exposure to CPF such as altered serine hydrolase activity, impacted metabolic processes, and immune-related outcomes. Other dysregulated pathways with less precedence in the literature included vasculature development and sensory perception of light stimulus. Apical outcomes of chronic CPF exposure included inhibition of AChE activity, increased relative liver weight, and a decrease in percentage of individuals that reached metamorphic climax. Dysregulation of serine hydrolase associated pathways after ELS CPF exposure is in agreeance with the decrease in AChE (a serine hydrolase enzyme) activity observed in the brains of individuals at metamorphic climax. Additionally, an increase in relative liver weight after chronic CPF exposure could be related to dysregulation of ELS pathways associated with metabolic processes and immune function. In fact, several pathways related to immune function were depleted.
In Chapter 3, we more closely examined the potential immunotoxicity of sub-lethal CPF exposure. Post-metamorphic individuals were exposed 1 or 10 μg L-1 CPF (nominal) for 7 days (d), then administered a phosphate buffered sodium (PBS) control injection or a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to stimulate an inflammatory response. At 24 h post-injection, morphometric indices were recorded and tissues were sampled for differential leukocyte counts (flow cytometry), liver pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (qPCR), and kidney histopathology. At 1 µg L−1 CPF, there was a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, an increase in circulating granulocytes, and an increase in the granulocyte:lymphocyte (GL) ratio regardless of immune state. Liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and CSF-1 was increased in individuals exposed to 10 µg L−1 CPF, independent of immune state. Exposure to 10 μg L-1 CPF increased kidney epithelial cell height (by 18 \%) and decreased lumen space in the convoluted tubules of the kidney. This study provided evidence that exposure to CPF can lead to changes in key biomarkers of immune status in amphibians in both immune-rested (PBS-injected) and immune-stimulated (LPS-injected) states. Additionally, we found that LPS was an effective mitogen in our study, capable of inducing a robust and measurable stress response in X. laevis. This response included a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, and increase in circulating monocytes, and an increase in the GL ratio. In addition, increased liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and CSF-1 was induced by LPS injection. We conclude that LPS is an appropriate immunostimulatory agent in an immune challenge assay using X. laevis and that exposure to CPF does not appear to impact the response to LPS exposure. 
Overall, our findings show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of CPF has the ability to impact amphibians at multiple levels of biological organization. A number of affected molecular pathways warrant further study in terms of the underlying mechanisms of CPF-mediated toxicity as well as the associated outcomes of CPF exposure in amphibians. This research provides novel data on the effects of CPF exposure to amphibians, which are generally overlooked and under-represented in the literature despite links between pesticide exposure and globally declining amphibian populations.},

 abstract = {Social insects’ nests harbor intruders known as inquilines,1 which are usually related to their hosts.2,3 However, distant non-social inquilines may also show convergences with their hosts,4,5 although the underlying genomic changes remain unclear. We analyzed the genome of the wingless and blind bee louse fly Braula coeca, an inquiline kleptoparasite of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera.6,7 Using large phylogenomic data, we confirmed recent accounts that the bee louse fly is a drosophilid8,9 and showed that it had likely evolved from a sap-breeder ancestor associated with honeydew and scale insects’ wax. Unlike many parasites, the bee louse fly genome did not show significant erosion or strict reliance on an endosymbiont, likely due to a relatively recent age of inquilinism. However, we observed a horizontal transfer of a transposon and a striking parallel evolution in a set of gene families between the honey bee and the bee louse fly. Convergences included genes potentially involved in metabolism and immunity and the loss of nearly all bitter-tasting gustatory receptors, in agreement with life in a protective nest and a diet of honey, pollen, and beeswax. Vision and odorant receptor genes also exhibited rapid losses. Only genes whose orthologs in the closely related Drosophila melanogaster respond to honey bee pheromone components or floral aroma were retained, whereas the losses included orthologous receptors responsive to the anti-ovarian honey bee queen pheromones. Hence, deep genomic convergences can underlie major phenotypic transitions during the evolution of inquilinism between non-social parasites and their social hosts.},

 abstract = {Astyanax mexicanus is a well-known model species, that has two morphotypes, cavefish, from subterranean rivers and surface fish, from surface rivers. They are morphologically distinct due to many troglomorphic traits in the cavefish, such as the absence of eyes. Most studies on A. mexicanus are focused on eye development and protein-coding genes involved in the process. However, lncRNAs did not get the same attention and very little is known about them. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap, identifying, describing, classifying, and annotating lncRNAs expressed in the embryo’s eye tissue of cavefish and surface fish. To do so, we constructed a concise workflow to assemble and evaluate transcriptomes, annotate protein-coding genes, ncRNAs families, predict the coding potential, identify putative lncRNAs, map them and predict interactions. This approach resulted in the identification of 33,069 and 19,493 putative lncRNAs respectively mapped in cavefish and surface fish. Thousands of these lncRNAs were annotated and identified as conserved in human and several species of fish. Hundreds of them were validated in silico, through ESTs. We identified lncRNAs associated with genes related to eye development. This is the case of a few lncRNAs associated with sox2, which we suggest being isomorphs of the SOX2-OT, a lncRNA that can regulate the expression of sox2. This work is one of the first studies to focus on the description of lncRNAs in A. mexicanus, highlighting several lncRNA targets and opening an important precedent for future studies focusing on lncRNAs expressed in A. mexicanus.},

@article{bawin_cuscuta_2024,
 abstract = {The Cuscuta genus comprises obligate parasitic plants that have an unusually wide host range. Whether Cuscuta uses different infection strategies for different hosts or whether the infection strategy is mechanistically and enzymatically conserved remains unknown. To address this, we investigated molecular events during the interaction between field dodder (Cuscuta campestris) and two host species of the Solanum genus that are known to react differently to parasitic infection. We found that host gene induction, particularly of cell wall fortifying genes, coincided with a differential induction of genes for cell wall degradation in the parasite in the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) but not in a wild relative (Solanum pennellii). This indicates that the parasite can adjust its gene expression in response to its host. This idea was supported by the increased expression of C. campestris genes encoding an endo-β-1,4-mannanase in response to exposure of the parasite to purified mono- and polysaccharides in a host-independent infection system. Our results suggest multiple key roles of the host cell wall in determining the outcome of an infection attempt.},

 abstract = {A Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain named A4, isolated from the gut of an Armenian honeybee, was subjected to a probiogenomic characterization because of its unusual origin. A whole-genome sequencing was performed, and the bioinformatic analysis of its genome revealed a reduction in the genome size and the number of the genes—a process typical for the adaptation to endosymbiotic conditions. Further analysis of the genome revealed that Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain named A4 could play the role of a probiotic endosymbiont because of the presence of intact genetic sequences determining antioxidant properties, exopolysaccharides synthesis, adhesion properties, and biofilm formation, as well as an antagonistic activity against some pathogens which is not due to pH or bacteriocins production. Additionally, the genomic analysis revealed significant potential for stress tolerance, such as extreme pH, osmotic stress, and high temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a potentially endosymbiotic Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain adapted to and playing beneficial roles for its host.},

Here, we report on the development of a first-in-class, carbohydrate-coupled inhibitor of microRNA-21 (RCS-21), as a therapeutic means against pulmonary hyperinflammation and fibrosis. MicroRNA-21 is among the strongest upregulated microRNAs in human COVID-19 and in mice with acute inflammatory lung damage, and it is the strongest expressed microRNA in pulmonary macrophages. Chemical linkage of a microRNA-21 inhibitor to trimannose achieves rapid and specific delivery to macrophages upon inhalation in mice. RCS-21 reverses pathological activation of macrophages and prevents pulmonary dysfunction and fibrosis after acute lung damage in mice. In human lung tissue infected with SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo, RCS-21 effectively prevents the exaggerated inflammatory response. Our data imply trimannose-coupling for effective and selective delivery of inhaled oligonucleotides to pulmonary macrophages and report on a first mannose-coupled candidate therapeutic for COVID-19.},

 abstract = {Sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VSs) often exhibit slow or negligible growth. Nevertheless, some VSs increase significantly in volume within a few months or grow continuously. Recent evidence indicates a role of inflammation in promoting VS growth. Therefore, our study aimed to identify cytokines, which are associated with larger VSs. The expression of different cytokines in VS tumor samples and VS primary cultures was investigated. Additionally, the concentration of cytokines in cell culture supernatants of VS primary cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of VS patients and healthy controls were determined. Correlation analysis of cytokine levels with tumor volume, growth rate, Koos grade, age, and hearing was examined with Spearman’s-rank test. The mRNA expression of CC-chemokine ligand (CCL) 18, growth differentiation factor (GDF) 15, and interferon regulatory factor 4 correlated positively with tumor volume. Moreover, the amount of GDF15 in the cell culture supernatant of primary cells correlated positively with tumor volume. The concentrations of the cytokines CCL2, CCL5, and CCL18 and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) 1 in the CSF of the patients were significantly different from those in the CSF controls. Inhibition of immune cell infiltration could be a putative approach to prevent and control VS growth.},

We report findings from a large-scale replicated EW field trial across a typical maize-soybean rotation on an experimental farm in the heart of the United Sates Corn Belt over 4 y (2016 to 2020). We show an average combined loss of major cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) from crushed basalt applied each fall over 4 y (50 t ha−1 y−1) gave a conservative time-integrated cumulative CDR potential of 10.5 ± 3.8 t CO2 ha−1. Maize and soybean yields increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) by 12 to 16\% with EW following improved soil fertility, decreased soil acidification, and upregulation of root nutrient transport genes. Yield enhancements with EW were achieved with significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased key micro- and macronutrient concentrations (including potassium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc), thus improving or maintaining crop nutritional status. We observed no significant increase in the content of trace metals in grains of maize or soybean or soil exchangeable pools relative to controls.

@article{belair_botryosphaeriaceae_2023,
 abstract = {The Botryosphaeriaceae family comprises numerous fungal pathogens capable of causing economically meaningful diseases in a wide range of crops. Many of its members can live as endophytes and turn into aggressive pathogens following the onset of environmental stress events. Their ability to cause disease may rely on the production of a broad set of effectors, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes, secondary metabolites, and peptidases. Here, we conducted comparative analyses of 41 genomes representing six Botryosphaeriaceae genera to provide insights into the genetic features linked to pathogenicity and virulence. We show that these Botryosphaeriaceae genomes possess a large diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes; 128 families) and peptidases (45 families). Botryosphaeria, Neofusicoccum, and Lasiodiplodia presented the highest number of genes encoding CAZymes involved in the degradation of the plant cell wall components. The genus Botryosphaeria also exhibited the highest abundance of secreted CAZymes and peptidases. Generally, the secondary metabolites gene cluster profile was consistent in the Botryosphaeriaceae family, except for Diplodia and Neoscytalidium. At the strain level, Neofusicoccum parvum NpBt67 stood out among all the Botryosphaeriaceae genomes, presenting a higher number of secretome constituents. In contrast, the Diplodia strains showed the lowest richness of the pathogenicity- and virulence-related genes, which may correlate with their low virulence reported in previous studies. Overall, these results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity and virulence in remarkable Botryosphaeriaceae species. Our results also support that Botryosphaeriaceae species could be used as an interesting biotechnological tool for lignocellulose fractionation and bioeconomy.},

@article{ben-oz_dual_2023,
 abstract = {p53-mediated cell cycle arrest during DNA damage is dependent on the induction of p21 protein, encoded by the CDKN1A gene. p21 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases required for cell cycle progression to guarantee accurate repair of DNA lesions. Hence, fine-tuning of p21 levels is crucial to preserve genomic stability. Currently, the multilayered regulation of p21 levels during DNA damage is not fully understood. Herein, we identify the human RNA binding motif protein 42 (RBM42) as a regulator of p21 levels during DNA damage. Genome-wide transcriptome and interactome analysis reveals that RBM42 alters the expression of p53-regulated genes during DNA damage. Specifically, we demonstrate that RBM42 facilitates CDKN1A splicing by counteracting the splicing inhibitory effect of RBM4 protein. Unexpectedly, we also show that RBM42, underpins translation of various splicing targets, including CDKN1A. Concordantly, transcriptome-wide mapping of RBM42-RNA interactions using eCLIP further substantiates the dual function of RBM42 in regulating splicing and translation of its target genes, including CDKN1A. Collectively, our data show that RBM42 couples splicing and translation machineries to fine-tune gene expression during DNA damage response.},

This study aims to investigate the long-term epidemiology of Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM)-producing E. coli in the health district of Bolzano, Northern Italy, by examining the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 26 isolates obtained during 2005–2020. Isolates were identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight, susceptibility testing was by Vitek 2, Sensititre, and Etest; carbapenemase activity was confirmed by Etest and Carbapenemase Inactivation Method (CIM) test; and the VIM-antigen was identified by the NG-Test CARBA 5. Genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations varied across methodologies, and overall category agreement between phenotypic methods was low. All 23 sequenced isolates contained blaVIM-1. Eleven (47.8\%) isolates belonged to the clonal lineage ST131, with fimH30 being the most common subclone. In Bolzano ST131-fimH30 was present as early as 2005. While the ST131 clonal lineage predominated for the first 10 years, various clonal lineages were present, especially in subsequent years, indicating the concurrent circulation of multiple clonal lineages. Future efforts should focus on the implementation of surveillance methods, including genomic analysis, as well as the use of updated infection control strategies and antibiotic stewardship programs to prevent the spread of these carbapenem-resistant strains.},

 abstract = {DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) approved for older AML patients are clinically tested in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). The mechanism of action of these drugs is still under debate. In colon cancer cells, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) can downregulate oncogenes and metabolic genes by reversing gene body DNA methylation, thus implicating gene body methylation as a novel drug target. We asked whether DAC-induced gene body demethylation in AML cells is also associated with gene repression, and whether the latter is enhanced by HDACi. Transcriptome analyses revealed that a combined treatment with DAC and the HDACi panobinostat or valproic acid affected significantly more transcripts than the sum of the genes regulated by either treatment alone, demonstrating a quantitative synergistic effect on genome-wide expression in U937 cells. This effect was particularly striking for downregulated genes. Integrative methylome and transcriptome analyses showed that a massive downregulation of genes, including oncogenes (e.g., MYC) and epigenetic modifiers (e.g., KDM2B, SUV39H1) often overexpressed in cancer, was associated predominantly with gene body DNA demethylation and changes in acH3K9/27. These findings have implications for the mechanism of action of combined epigenetic treatments, and for a better understanding of responses in trials where this approach is clinically tested.},

 abstract = {Introduction
Catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline are key regulators of cardiac function in response to increased demand due to stress, illness, or injury, and are used as therapeutic drugs in intensive care medicine. Continuous overactivation of adrenergic receptors, e.g. in heart failure, clearly aggravates detrimental cardiac remodeling, however, whether transient adrenergic stimulation causes persistent myocardial injury remains debated. In this study, we asked whether the structural alterations of the heart induced by adrenergic stimulation are reversible and investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the remodeling and reverse remodeling process.
Methods and results
Wild-type mice were assigned to 14 days treatment with isoprenaline and phenylephrine (IsoPE), treatment with IsoPE and subsequent recovery, or healthy control groups. IsoPE induced substantial cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy without signs of functional impairment during echocardiography. RNA sequencing from cardiomyocyte nuclei isolated by flow cytometry revealed marked changes in gene expression after IsoPE treatment (295 differentially expressed genes) related to transforming growth factor signaling, vasculature development, or extracellular matrix organization. Analysis of enhancer regions that were linked to differentially expressed genes identified AP-1 family members Jun and Fos as key drivers of these processes and predicted their direct target genes in cardiomyocytes. IsoPE induced marked changes in the gene expression of adrenergic receptors and their downstream signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes that may be related to receptor desensitization. Within two weeks after IsoPE withdrawal, structural remodeling of the heart recovered and {\textasciitilde}95 \% of genes that were differentially expressed with IsoPE treatment returned to baseline expression.
Conclusion
We demonstrate here that prolonged catecholamine treatment at doses that induce left ventricular hypercontractility, but no overt heart failure, resulted in significant yet reversible cardiac injury. Immediate early transcription factors such as Jun and Fos were identified as main drivers of IsoPE induced pathological gene expression in cardiomyocytes.},

 abstract = {Recombinantly produced proteins are indispensable tools for medical applications. Since the majority of them are glycoproteins, their N-glycosylation profiles are major determinants for their activity, structural properties and safety. For therapeutical applications, a glycosylation pattern adapted to product and treatment requirements is advantageous. Physcomitrium patens (Physcomitrella, moss) is able to perform highly homogeneous complex-type N-glycosylation. Additionally, it has been glyco-engineered to eliminate plant-specific sugar residues by knock-out of the β1,2-xylosyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase genes (Δxt/ft). Furthermore, Physcomitrella meets wide-ranging biopharmaceutical requirements such as GMP compliance, product safety, scalability and outstanding possibilities for precise genome engineering. However, all plants, in contrast to mammals, lack the capability to perform N-glycan sialylation. Since sialic acids are a common terminal modification on human N glycans, the property to perform N-glycan sialylation is highly desired within the plant-based biopharmaceutical sector. In this study, we present the successful achievement of protein N-glycan sialylation in stably transformed Physcomitrella. The sialylation ability was achieved in a Δxt/ft moss line by stable expression of seven mammalian coding sequences combined with targeted organelle-specific localization of the encoded enzymes responsible for the generation of β1,4 galactosylated acceptor N glycans as well as the synthesis, activation, transport and transfer of sialic acid. Production of free (Neu5Ac) and activated (CMP-Neu5Ac) sialic acid was proven. The glycosidic anchor for the attachment of terminal sialic acid was generated by the introduction of a chimeric human β1,4 galactosyltransferase gene under the simultaneous knock-out of the gene encoding the endogenous β1,3 galactosyltransferase. Functional complex-type N-glycan sialylation was confirmed via mass spectrometric analysis of a stably co-expressed recombinant human protein.},

 abstract = {Alternative mRNA splicing is common in cancers. In BRAF V600E-mutated malignant melanoma, a frequent mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors involves alternative splicing (AS) of BRAF. The resulting shortened BRAF protein constitutively dimerizes and conveys drug resistance. Here, we have analysed AS in SK-MEL-239 melanoma cells and a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib)-resistant derivative that expresses an AS, shortened BRAF V600E transcript. Transcriptome analysis showed differential expression of spliceosome components between the two cell lines. As there is no consensus approach to analysing AS events, we used and compared four common AS softwares based on different principles, DEXSeq, rMATS, ASpli, and LeafCutter. Two of them correctly identified the BRAF V600E AS in the vemurafenib-resistant cells. Only 12 AS events were identified by all four softwares. Testing the AS predictions experimentally showed that these overlapping predictions are highly accurate. Interestingly, they identified AS caused alterations in the expression of melanin synthesis and cell migration genes in the vemurafenib-resistant cells. This analysis shows that combining different AS analysis approaches produces reliable results and meaningful, biologically testable hypotheses.},

To compare MACE to standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, four healthy conjunctiva from four subjects were collected during vitreoretinal surgery, halved and immediately transferred to RNA lysis buffer without prior fixation and then processed for either standard RNA-Seq or MACE RNA-Seq analysis. To assess the impact of FFPE preparation on MACE, a third part was fixed in formalin and processed for paraffin embedding, and its transcriptional profile was compared with the unfixed specimens analyzed by MACE. To investigate the impact of FFPE storage time on MACE results, 24 FFPE-treated conjunctival samples from 24 patients were analyzed as well. Nineteen thousand six hundred fifty-nine transcribed genes were detected by both MACE and standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, while 3251 and 2213 transcripts were identified explicitly by MACE or RNA-Seq, respectively. Standard RNA-Seq tended to yield longer detected transcripts more often than MACE technology despite normalization, indicating that the MACE technology is less susceptible to a length bias. FFPE processing revealed negligible effects on MACE sequencing results. Several quality-control measurements showed that long-term storage in paraffin did not decrease the diversity of MACE libraries. We noted a nonlinear relation between storage time and the number of raw reads with an accelerated decrease within the first 1000 days in paraffin, while the numbers remained relatively stable in older samples. Interestingly, the number of transcribed genes detected was independent on FFPE storage time. RNA of sufficient quality and quantity can be extracted from FFPE samples to obtain comprehensive transcriptome profiling using MACE technology. We thus present MACE as a novel opportunity for utilizing FFPE samples stored in histological archives.},

In this study we compare its expression profile to conjunctival papilloma (Pap) and healthy conjunctival tissue (Ctrl) and develop a classification tool to differentiate these entities. Seven conjunctival SCC, seven Pap and ten Ctrl were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and analyzed using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and gene ontology (GO) clusters were explored and the abundance of involved cell types was quantified by xCell. Finally, a classification model was developed to distinguish SCC from Pap and Ctrl. Among the most prominent DEG in SCC a plethora of keratins were upregulated when compared to Pap and Ctrl. xCell analysis revealed an enrichment of immune cells, including activated dendritic cells and T-helper type 1 cells (Th1), in SCC when compared to Ctrl. The generated classification model could reliably discriminate between the three entities according to the expression pattern of 30 factors. This study provides a transcriptome-wide gene expression profile of rare conjunctival SCC. The analysis identifies distinct keratins, as well as dendritic and Th1 cells as important mediators in SCC. Finally, the provided gene expression classifier may become an aid to the conventional histological classification of conjunctival tumors in uncertain cases.},

This study involves a total of 13 patients of advanced age with disorders of the vitreoretinal interface undergoing vitrectomy at the University Eye Hospital Freiburg between 2018 and 2019. Vitreal hyalocytes were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and isolated as CD45+CD11b+CX3CR1+Mat-Mac+ cells using a FACS-based sorting protocol. RNA extraction, library preparation and RNA sequencing were performed and the sequencing data was analyzed using the Galaxy web platform. The transcriptome of human hyalocytes was compared to the transcriptional profile of human blood-derived monocytes, macrophages and brain microglia obtained from public databases. Protein validation for selected factors was performed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections from three human donor eyes. On average, 383 ± 233 hyalocytes were isolated per patient, resulting in 128 pg/µl ± 76 pg/µl total RNA per sample. RNA sequencing revealed that SPP1, FTL, CD74 and HLA-DRA are among the most abundantly expressed genes in hyalocytes, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence for CD74, FTL and HLA-DRA. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that biological processes such as “humoral immune response”, “leukocyte migration” and “antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen” (adjusted p \&lt; 0.001) are dominating in vitreal hyalocytes. While the comparison of the gene expression profiles of hyalocytes and other myeloid cell populations showed an overall strong similarity (R2 \&gt; 0.637, p \&lt; 0.001), hyalocytes demonstrated significant differences with respect to common leukocyte-associated factors. In particular, transcripts involved in the immune privilege of the eye, such as POMC, CD46 and CD86, were significantly increased in hyalocytes compared to other myeloid cell subsets. Human hyalocytes represent a unique and distinct innate immune cell population specialized and adapted for the tissue-specific needs in the human vitreous. Vitreal hyalocytes are characterized by a strong expression of genes related to antigen processing and presentation as well as immune modulation. Thus, hyalocytes may represent an underestimated mediator in vitreoretinal disease and for the immune privilege of the eye.},

Salmon lice have a life cycle consisting of eight life stages. Sex determination by eye is only possible from the sixth stage onwards. A molecular sex determination has not been carried out so far, even though few individual sex-linked SNPs have been reported. In the present study, we used known sex-specific SNPs as a basis to sequence the complete sex-specific gene variants and used the sequence information to develop a sex determination assay. This assay could be used to determine the developmental speed of the two sexes already in the earliest life stages. Additionally, we sampled salmon lice in the nauplius II stage, determined the sex of each individual, pooled their RNA according to their sex, and used RNA sequencing to search for differences in gene expression and further sex-specific SNPs. We succeeded in developing a sex-determination assay that works on DNA or RNA from even the earliest larval stages of the salmon louse after hatching. At these early developmental stages, male salmon lice develop slightly quicker than females. We detected several previously unknown, sex-specific SNPs in our RNA-data seq, but only very few genes showed a differential expression between the sexes. Potential connections between SNPs, gene expression, and development are discussed.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Metaproteomics has matured into a powerful tool to assess functional interactions in microbial communities. While many metaproteomic workflows are available, the impact of method choice on results remains unclear. Here, we carried out the first community-driven, multi-lab comparison in metaproteomics: the critical assessment of metaproteome investigation study (CAMPI). Based on well-established workflows, we evaluated the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, lab-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observed that variability at the peptide level was predominantly due to wet-lab workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level differences largely disappeared at protein group level. While differences were observed for predicted community composition, similar functional profiles were obtained across workflows. CAMPI demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics research, serves as a template for multi-lab studies in metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for benchmarking future developments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {The disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) mediates methylation of histone H3 at position lysine 79 (H3K79). Conditional knockout of Dot1l in mouse cerebellar granule cells (Dot1l-cKOAtoh1) led to a smaller external granular layer with fewer precursors of granule neurons. Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 mice had impaired proliferation and differentiation of granular progenitors, which resulted in a smaller cerebellum. Mutant mice showed mild ataxia in motor behavior tests. In contrast, Purkinje cell-specific conditional knockout mice showed no obvious phenotype. Genome-wide transcription analysis of Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 cerebella using microarrays revealed changes in genes that function in cell cycle, cell migration, axon guidance, and metabolism. To identify direct DOT1L target genes, we used genome-wide profiling of H3K79me2 and transcriptional analysis. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DR) and differentially expressed genes (DE) revealed in total 12 putative DOT1L target genes in Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 affecting signaling (Tnfaip8l3, B3galt5), transcription (Otx1), cell migration and axon guidance (Sema4a, Sema5a, Robo1), cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Lss, Cyp51), cell cycle (Cdkn1a), calcium-dependent cell-adhesion or exocytosis (Pcdh17, Cadps2), and unknown function (Fam174b). Dysregulated expression of these target genes might be implicated in the ataxia phenotype observed in Dot1l-cKOAtoh1.},

We use up-to-date models of the gravitational wave power spectra to compare constraints on the parameters of the phase transition for the three different available PTA measurements and to work out a refined estimate of the cosmological magnetic field that should result from this transition. We find that the PTA data, combined with a constraint from the abundance of primordial black holes, are consistent with a possibility of a moderate strength first-order phase transition during quark confinement and yield a rather precise prediction for the initial parameters of the magnetic field, with the magnetic field energy density in near equipartition with photon energy density and correlation length close to one co-moving parsec.},

 abstract = {Cyanobacteria are highly promising microorganisms in forthcoming biotechnologies. Besides the systematic development of molecular tools for genetic engineering, the design of chassis strains and novel reactor concepts are in focus. The latter includes capillary biofilm reactors (CBR), which offer a high surface area-to-volume ratio and very high cell densities. In this context, Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7712 was found to be highly suited for this reactor system due to maximal surface coverage, extraordinarily strong biofilm attachment, and high biomass formation. Here, we provide the genome sequence of Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7712 to potentially allow targeted strain engineering. Surprisingly, it was almost identical to an available incomplete genome draft of Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7601. Thus, we completely sequenced this strain as well and compared it in detail to strain PCC 7712. Comparative genome analysis revealed 257 and 80 unique protein-coding sequences for strains PCC 7601 and PCC 7712, respectively. Clustering genomes based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 16S rRNA homology showed 99.98\% similarity and only minor distance, respectively, between the two strains in contrast to 21 other cyanobacterial genomes. Despite these high similarities, both strains differ in the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and show specific sequence variations, which are discussed in the paper.},

 abstract = {Objectives
This study reports the genomic characterization of the multidrug resistant Salmonella Newport strain 195\_20 recovered from the diarrheic faeces of a foal in Brazil and co-harbouring the mcr-9, blaCMY-2 and qnrB19 antibiotic resistance genes.
Methods
Bacterial isolate positive for mobile colistin resistance gene (mcr-9) was submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion and broth microdilution for colistin and polymyxin B. The isolate was submitted to whole genome sequencing by Illumina technology and Nanopore Sequencing. Conjugation assays, plasmid sizes determined by S1-PFGE and plasmid content were investigated by hybrid assembly after MinIon long reads sequencing.
Results
Isolate 195\_20 was identified as sequence type ST45, resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins (ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime), aminoglycosides (streptomycin and gentamicin), phenicol (chloramphenicol), quinolones and fluoroquinolones (nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and pefloxacin), folate pathway antagonists (sulfonamides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and tetracycline. A transferable IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid sized ca. 262kb was found to carry the mcr-9 gene in a module consisting of IS903-mcr-9-wbuC-IS26. In addition, an 174kb IncC and a 48kb IncN plasmid were also identified in the 195\_20 isolate, carrying blaCMY-2 and qnrB19, respectively.
Conclusions
Not surprisingly, isolate 195\_20 was susceptible to polymyxins, possibly due to absence of qseBC regulatory operon. Presence of mobile colistin resistance (mcr-9), third-generation cephalosporins (blaCMY-2) and quinolone (qnrB19) resistance determinants in zoonotic pathogens from animals in close contact with humans alerts for the possible route of transmission between these different reservoirs.},

 abstract = {Harmful algal blooms plague bodies of freshwater globally. These blooms are often composed of outgrowths of cyanobacteria capable of producing the heptapeptide Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) which is a well-known hepatotoxin. Recently, MC-LR has been detected in aerosols generated from lake water. However, the risk for human health effects due to MC-LR inhalation exposure have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we exposed a fully differentiated 3D human airway epithelium derived from 14 healthy donors to MC-LR-containing aerosol once a day for 3 days. Concentrations of MC-LR ranged from 100 pM to 1 µM. Although there were little to no detrimental alterations in measures of the airway epithelial function (i.e. cell survival, tissue integrity, mucociliary clearance, or cilia beating frequency), a distinct shift in the transcriptional activity was found. Genes related to inflammation were found to be upregulated such as C-C motif chemokine 5 (CCL5; log2FC = 0.57, p = 0.03) and C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7; log2FC = 0.84, p = 0.03). Functionally, conditioned media from MC-LR exposed airway epithelium was also found to have significant chemo-attractive properties for primary human neutrophils. Additionally, increases were found in the concentration of secreted chemokine proteins in the conditioned media such as CCL1 (log2FC = 5.07, p = 0.0001) and CCL5 (log2FC = 1.02, p = 0.046). These results suggest that MC-LR exposure to the human airway epithelium is capable of inducing an inflammatory response that may potentiate acute or chronic disease.},

 abstract = {Chromatin properties are regulated by complex networks of epigenome modifications. Currently, it is unclear how these modifications interact and if they control downstream effects such as gene expression. We employed promiscuous chromatin binding of a zinc finger fused catalytic domain of DNMT3A to introduce DNA methylation in HEK293 cells at many CpG islands (CGIs) and systematically investigated the dynamics of the introduced DNA methylation and the consequent changes of the epigenome network. We observed efficient methylation at thousands of CGIs, but it was unstable at about 90\% of them, highlighting the power of genome-wide molecular processes that protect CGIs against DNA methylation. Partially stable methylation was observed at about 1000 CGIs, which showed enrichment in H3K27me3. Globally, the introduced DNA methylation strongly correlated with a decrease in gene expression indicating a direct effect. Similarly, global but transient reductions in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac were observed after DNA methylation but no changes were found for H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. Our data provide a global and time-resolved view on the network of epigenome modifications, their connections with DNA methylation and the responses triggered by artificial DNA methylation revealing a direct repressive effect of DNA methylation in CGIs on H3K4me3, histone acetylation, and gene expression.},

 abstract = {While cytosine-C5 methylation of DNA is an essential regulatory system in higher eukaryotes, the presence and relevance of 6-methyladenine (m6dA) in human cells is controversial. To study the role of m6dA in human DNA, we introduced it in human cells at a genome-wide scale at GANTC and GATC sites by expression of bacterial DNA methyltransferases and observed concomitant reductions in cell viability, in particular after global GANTC methylation. We identified several genes that are directly regulated by m6dA in a GANTC context. Upregulated genes showed m6dA-dependent reduction of H3K27me3 suggesting that the PRC2 complex is inhibited by m6dA. Genes downregulated by m6dA showed enrichment of JUN family transcription factor binding sites. JUN binds m6dA containing DNA with reduced affinity suggesting that m6dA can reduce the recruitment of JUN transcription factors to target genes. Our study documents that global introduction of m6dA in human DNA has physiological effects. Furthermore, we identified a set of target genes which are directly regulated by m6dA in human cells, and we defined two molecular pathways with opposing effects by which artificially introduced m6dA in GANTC motifs can directly control gene expression and phenotypes of human cells.},

It has a high potential for basic research and biotechnological applications, e.g., it can be used for the cell-free production of (labeled) heterologous proteins, for synthetic biological applications, and for the production of various compounds. However, the ploidy level in V. natriegens remains unknown. At nine time points throughout the growth curve, we analyzed the numbers of origins and termini of both chromosomes with qPCR and the relative abundances of all genomic sites with marker frequency analyses. During the lag phase until early exponential growth, the origin copy number and origin/terminus ratio of chromosome 1 increased severalfold, but the increase was lower for chromosome 2. This increase was paralleled by an increase in cell volume. During the exponential phase, the origin/terminus ratio and cell volume decreased again. This highly dynamic and fast regulation has not yet been described for any other species. In this study, the gene dosage increase in origin-adjacent genes during the lag phase is discussed together with the nonrandom distribution of genes on the chromosomes of V. natriegens. Taken together, the results of this study provide the first comprehensive overview of the chromosome dynamics in V. natriegens and will guide the optimization of molecular biological characterization and biotechnological applications.},

However, a growing number of studies report expression of proteins from allegedly non-coding regions, challenging the accuracy of current genome annotations. These novel proteins were found encoded either within non-coding RNAs, 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, or overlapping a known coding sequence (CDS) in an alternative ORF. OpenProt is the first database that enforces a polycistronic model for eukaryotic genomes, allowing annotation of multiple ORFs per transcript. OpenProt is freely accessible and offers custom downloads of protein sequences across 10 species. Using OpenProt database for proteomic experiments enables novel proteins discovery and highlights the polycistronic nature of eukaryotic genes. The size of OpenProt database (all predicted proteins) is substantial and need be taken in account for the analysis. However, with appropriate false discovery rate (FDR) settings or the use of a restricted OpenProt database, users will gain a more realistic view of the proteomic landscape. Overall, OpenProt is a freely available tool that will foster proteomic discoveries.},

 abstract = {DNA replication produces a global disorganization of chromatin structure that takes hours to be restored. However, how these chromatin rearrangements affect the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of cell identity is not clear. Here, we use ChOR-seq and ChrRNA-seq experiments to analyze RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity and nascent RNA synthesis during the first hours after chromatin replication in human cells. We observe that transcription elongation is rapidly reactivated in nascent chromatin but that RNAPII abundance and distribution are altered, producing heterogeneous changes in RNA synthesis. Moreover, this first wave of transcription results in RNAPII blockages behind the replication fork, leading to changes in alternative splicing. Altogether, our results deepen our understanding of how transcriptional programs are regulated during cell division and uncover molecular mechanisms that explain why chromatin replication is an important source of gene expression variability.},

PIM kinases are downstream of several cytokine signaling pathways that drive immune-mediated diseases. Uncontrolled T helper 17 (Th17) cell activation has been associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. However, the detailed molecular function of PIMs in human Th17 cell regulation has yet to be studied. In the present study, we comprehensively investigated how the three PIMs simultaneously alter transcriptional gene regulation during early human Th17 cell differentiation. By combining PIM triple knockdown with bulk and scRNA-seq approaches, we found that PIM deficiency promotes the early expression of key Th17-related genes while suppressing Th1-lineage genes. Further, PIMs modulate Th cell signaling, potentially via STAT1 and STAT3. Overall, our study highlights the inhibitory role of PIMs in human Th17 cell differentiation, thereby suggesting their association with autoimmune phenotypes.},

This strain A2879T was isolated from an abscess swab of a patient sampled during routine care at hospital. Phylogenetic analyses (full-­length 16S rRNA gene and whole-­genome sequence) revealed the strain to belong to the genus Prevotella, but to be distant from recognized species, with the closest relationship to Prevotella veroralis. Unambiguous identification also proved possible by MALDI-­TOF MS. The genomic DNA G+C content was 41.5 mol\%. Strain A2879T was moderately saccharolytic and proteolytic. The most abundant cellular long-­chain fatty acids were anteiso-C­ 15 : 0 and iso-C­ 15 : 0. In view of these data, strain A2879T is considered to represent a novel species within the genus Prevotella, for which the name Prevotella vespertina sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A2879T (=DSM 108027T=CCOS 1233T=CCUG72808T). As this strain has been isolated from a clinical sample, it is considered relevant for human medicine and health in general, and in particular for the fields of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases. This description will enable routine and research laboratories alike to easily identify the novel taxon, allowing its role in the context of human health and disease or microbiota to be further elucidated.},

This study provides a detailed description of Pectobacterium phage CB7 (vB\_PatM\_CB7), which specifically infects P. atrosepticum. Host range, morphology, latent period, burst size and stability at different conditions of temperature and pH were examined. Analysis of its genome (142.8 kbp) shows that the phage forms a new species of Certrevirus, sharing sequence similarity with other members, highlighting conservation within the genus. Conserved elements include a putative early promoter like that of the Escherichia coli sigma70 promoter, which was found to be shared with other genus members. A number of dissimilarities were observed, relating to DNA methylation and nucleotide metabolism. Some members do not have homologues of a cytosine methylase and anaerobic nucleotide reductase subunits NrdD and NrdG, respectively. Furthermore, the genome of CB7 contains one of the largest numbers of homing endonucleases described in a single phage genome in the literature to date, with a total of 23 belonging to the HNH and LAGLIDADG families. Analysis by RT-PCR of the HNH homing endonuclease residing within introns of genes for the large terminase, DNA polymerase, ribonucleotide reductase subunits NrdA and NrdB show that they are splicing competent. Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was also performed on the virion of CB7, allowing the identification of 26 structural proteins\&mdash;20 of which were found to be shared with the type phages of the genera of Vequintavirus and Seunavirus. The results of this study provide greater insights into the phages of the Certrevirus genus as well as the subfamily Vequintavirinae.},

Therefore, evaluation of novel antimicrobial drugs is needed to identify potential treatments with better outcomes. We evaluated the in vitro activity of novel antimicrobial drugs/combinations against 97 KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from different hospitals in Brazil during 2021–2022. Clonality, resistance and virulence genes were detected by whole-genome sequencing. The majority of the isolates (54.6\%) were classified as extensively drug resistant or multidrug resistant (44.3\%); one isolate showed a pandrug resistance phenotype. The most active antimicrobial agents were meropenem-vaborbactam, cefiderocol, and ceftazidime-avibactam, with sensitivities higher than 90\%; resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam was associated with KPC-33 or KPC-44 variants. Colistin and polymyxin B were active against 58.6\% of the isolates. The 97 isolates were distributed into 17 different sequence types, with a predominance of ST11 (37.4\%). Although high in vitro susceptibility rates were detected for meropenem-vaborbactam and cefiderocol, only ceftazidime-avibactam is currently available in Brazil. Our findings showed limited susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs employed for infection treatment of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, underscoring the urgent need for stringent policies for antimicrobial stewardship to preserve the activity of such drugs.},

In recent years, the frequency of carbapenemases in P. aeruginosa has decreased, which allows use of new beta-lactams/combinations in antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, the in vitro evaluation of these drugs in contemporary isolates is warranted. We evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility and genomic aspects of 119 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from 24 different hospitals in Brazil in 2021–2022. Identification was performed via MALDI-TOF-MS, and antimicrobial susceptibility was identified through broth microdilution, gradient tests, or disk diffusion. Whole-genome sequencing was carried out using NextSeq equipment. The most active drug was cefiderocol (100\%), followed by ceftazidime–avibactam (94.1\%), ceftolozane–tazobactam (92.4\%), and imipenem–relebactam (81.5\%). Imipenem susceptibility was detected in 59 isolates (49.6\%), and the most active aminoglycoside was tobramycin, to which 99 (83.2\%) isolates were susceptible. Seventy-one different sequence types (STs) were detected, including twelve new STs described herein. The acquired resistance genes blaCTX-M-2 and blaKPC-2 were identified in ten (8.4\%) and two (1.7\%) isolates, respectively. Several virulence genes (exoSTUY, toxA, aprA, lasA/B, plcH) were also identified. We found that new antimicrobials are effective against the diverse P. aeruginosa population that has been circulating in Brazilian hospitals in recent years.},

 abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequent extracranial solid tumour in childhood. The clinical diagnosis of NB is difficult due to the age of the patient and the vague appearance of the symptoms. Moreover, there are two groups of aggressive NBs, one with MYCN amplification and the other with an 11q deletion. Some genes could be a candidate suppressor for NB, e.g., the DLG2 gene that resides within the 11q-deleted region. The DLG2 gene has a large number of exons and multiple isoforms depending on the alternative splicing process. Moreover, these isoforms can include the L27 domain or not. This study aimed to analyse, by applying bioinformatic tools, if isoform 2, which does not have L27 domain, could be a candidate suppressor for this disease. RNA-seq samples from different human cell lines were collected from NCBI and a quality analysis was performed. The filtered samples were run in R and Python programs to do a visualization of the exon expression level and the prediction of Rsubread for exon-exon junctions. The results showed that isoform 2 of DLG2 gene was not expressed in the samples of NB, which is a promising result for being a candidate suppressor of NB. Furthermore, the prediction of exon-exon junctions by Rsubread was confirmed to be very accurate. In conclusion, this study shows that isoform 2 of DLG2 gene could be a candidate tumour suppressor in NB that could, in the future, be used as a target to help to detect earlier the presence of NB and increase the life expectancy of children who suffer from this disease.},

@phdthesis{cantarella_insights_2020,
 abstract = {A large portion of the human genome is composed of repeated sequences, with Alu retrotransposons representing the most abundant repetitive elements. Alu sequences belong to the class of the Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) and depend on the Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) for their mobilization into the genome. The efficiency of Alu amplification during primate evolution suggests a positive driving force for their accumulation, bringing up to 1 million copies in the human genome. For unclear reasons, the majority of Alu sequences is repressed by tight epigenetic silencing, which is released in response to cell stresses such as virus infection and cancer progression. Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is known to cause an increase of Alu transcription in HeLa, myelogenous leukemia and embryonic kidney cell lines, even though the virus factors that are responsible for this transcriptional enhancement have not been identified yet. Potential candidates could be represented by oncovirus proteins that induce a global remodeling of the host epigenetic landscape. For example, the Adenovirus early E1A protein interacts with the host tumor suppressor Rb, the lysine acetylase p300 and the p400 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, resulting in the induction of quiescent fibroblasts to enter the S-phase of the cell cycle. 
The exceptional success of Alu expansion and their retention even at the cost of a strong epigenetic silencing, which is released by virus infection, led us to investigate the molecular mechanism of Alus activation and their potential involvement in various cell processes.  
Firstly, genome-wide Alu profiling was performed in quiescent human primary fibroblasts infected with the Ad5 dl1500 mutant, which only expresses the oncovirus small E1A protein. A total of 1880 Polymerase III (Pol III) transcribed Alus were detected through high throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), revealing a 4-fold increase of the average Alu expression induced by small E1A.   
With the aim of identifying small E1A-host protein interactions that are crucial for the activation of Alu expression, the host proteins Rb, p300 and p400 were put under investigation. Alu expression profiling was performed in cells infected with small E1A mutants that are not capable to bind Rb, p300 or p400. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data revealed that the small E1A-p400 binding mutant was the least efficient in activating Alu expression, whereas a milder effect was reported for small E1A-Rb and small E1A-p300 binding mutants. Moreover, ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of dl1500 infected fibroblasts revealed an enrichment of H3K4me1 within the body of small E1A-induced Alus. Our data point toward the existence of H3K4me1 Alu loci that are recognized by p400 bound by small E1A, resulting in Alu transcription in response to virus infection. 
Secondly, two Alu sequences were stably overexpressed in one primary and one cancer cell line (human fibroblasts and HeLa cells, respectively) and differential gene expression in Alu-overexpressing cells was performed through RNA-seq data analysis. Among the two Alu- overexpressing fibroblast cell lines, 330 genes were detected as Differentially Expressed (DE), whereas only two genes were differentially expressed in HeLa cells. Interestingly, DE genes detected in Alu-overexpressing fibroblasts were significantly enriched in pathways belonging to cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. The promotion of cell cycle was also supported by a significantly higher percentage of cells in the S-phase compared to control samples as revealed by flow cytometry.  
The studies conducted in this work identify Ad5 small E1A as one of the virus factors that enhance Alu transcription, possibly through binding with the p400 complex. Interestingly, the overexpression of two Alu sequences in human fibroblasts leads to the stimulation of cell cycle progression, resulting in the same phenotype as previously observed in Ad5 infected fibroblasts. This brings us to speculate that the overexpression of Alu sequences during stress response to viral infection could be exploited by Ad5 to sustain cell proliferation.},

 abstract = {Providencia stuartii is a member of the Morganellaceae family, notorious for its intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics, including last-resort drugs such as colistin and tigecycline. Between February and March 2022, a four-patient outbreak sustained by P. stuartii occurred in a hospital in Rome. Phenotypic analyses defined these strains as eXtensively Drug-Resistant (XDR). Whole-genome sequencing was performed on the representative P. stuartii strains and resulted in fully closed genomes and plasmids. The genomes were highly related phylogenetically and encoded various virulence factors, including fimbrial clusters. The XDR phenotype was primarily driven by the presence of the blaNDM-1 metallo-β-lactamase alongside the rmtC 16S rRNA methyltransferase, conferring resistance to most β-lactams and every aminoglycoside, respectively. These genes were found on an IncC plasmid that was highly related to an NDM-IncC plasmid retrieved from a ST15 Klebsiella pneumoniae strain circulating in the same hospital two years earlier. Given its ability to acquire resistance plasmids and its intrinsic resistance mechanisms, P. stuartii is a formidable pathogen. The emergence of XDR P. stuartii strains poses a significant public health threat. It is essential to monitor the spread of these strains and develop new strategies for their control and treatment.},

Pannonibacter spp. is an environmental Gram-negative bacterium not commonly associated with nosocomial infections. Species identification was performed using Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) for both strains. Genomic analyses for the two isolates, BLAST similarity search, and phylogeny for the 16S rDNA sequences lead to an assignment to the species Pannonibacter phragmitetus. However, by performing ANIb, ANIm, tetranucleotide correlation, and DNA-DNA digital hybridization, analyses of the two draft genomes showed that they were very different from those of the species P. phragmitetus. MALDI-TOF analysis, assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility by E-test method, and Analytical Profile Index (API) tests were also performed. This result highlights how environmental bacterial species can easily adapt to the human host and, especially in nosocomial environments, also gain pathogenic potential through antimicrobial resistance.},

@article{cermak_unexpected_2020,
 abstract = {In plants, posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is induced by small RNAs (sRNAs) generated from various dsRNA precursors. To assess the impact of dsRNA origin, we compared downregulation of GFP expression triggered by inverted repeat (IR), antisense (AS) and unterminated sense (UT) transcripts transiently expressed from the estradiol-inducible promoter. The use of homogeneously responding tobacco BY-2 cell lines allowed monitoring the onset of silencing and its reversibility. In this system, IR induced the strongest and fastest silencing accompanied by dense DNA methylation. At low induction, silencing in individual cells was binary (either strong or missing), suggesting that a certain threshold sRNA level had to be exceeded. The AS variant specifically showed a deviated sRNA-strand ratio shifted in favor of antisense orientation. In AS lines and weakly induced IR lines, only the silencer DNA was methylated, but the same target GFP sequence was not, showing that DNA methylation accompanying PTGS was influenced both by the level and origin of sRNAs, and possibly also by the epigenetic state of the locus. UT silencing appeared to be the least effective and resembled classical sense PTGS. The best responding UT lines behaved relatively heterogeneously possibly due to complexly arranged T-DNA insertions. Unlike IR and AS variants that fully restored GFP expression upon removal of the inducer, only partial reactivation was observed in some UT lines. Our results pointed out several not yet described phenomena and differences between the long-known silencer variants that may direct further research and affect selection of proper silencer variants for specific applications.},

 abstract = {Common sage (Salvia officinalis L.), the type species of the genus Salvia, is a historically acknowledged medicinal and aromatic plant that is utilized in several different industries for manufacturing diverse end products, including food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, personal hygiene products and insect repellants. The medical uses of sage essential oil terpenoids have made these secondary metabolites a focus of medical/pharmaceutical chemistry research. In the present work, the common sage genome was resequenced and assembled, and the protein-encoding gene content was annotated. The terpenoid biosynthesis gene repertoire, which includes 75 terpene synthase and 67 terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway genes, was predicted and located on assembly scaffolds, revealing tandem duplication blocks on the chromosomes. Variant analysis identified 188 variable single-nucleotide loci in the coding sequences of sage terpenoid biosynthesis genes. A total of 24,570 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the common sage total exome, representing a database of potential variable loci for targeted genotyping research. Given that terpene synthase activity is highly prone to modulation by point mutations and that the genotype plays an important role in the complex traits of terpenoid composition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in coding sequences constitute candidate functional markers that can be associated with terpenoid compositional traits in future research.},

 abstract = {Actinobacteria are well known as a rich source of diversity of bioactive secondary metabolites. Kutzneria, a rare actinobacteria belonging to the family Pseudonocardiaceae has abundance of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and is one of important source of natural products and worthy of priority investigation. Currently, Kutzneria chonburiensis SMC256T has been the latest type-strain of the genus and its genome sequence has not been reported yet. Therefore, we present the first report of new complete genome sequence of SMC256T (genome size of 10.4 Mbp) with genome annotation and feature comparison between SMC256T and other publicly available Kutzneria species. The results from comparative and functional genomic analyses regarding the phylogenomic and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) analyses indicated that SMC256T is most closely related to Kutzneria sp. 744, Kutzneria kofuensis, Kutzneria sp. CA-103260 and Kutzneria buriramensis. Furthermore, a total of 322 BGCs were also detected and showed diversity among the Kutzneria genomes. Out of which, 38 clusters showing the best hit to the most known BGCs were predicted in the SMC256Tgenome. We observed that six clusters responsible for biosynthesis of antimicrobials/antitumor metabolites were strain-specific in Kutzneria chonburiensis. These putative metabolites include virginiamycin S1, lysolipin I, esmeraldin, rakicidin, aclacinomycin and streptoseomycin. Based on these findings, the genome of Kutzneria chonburiensis contains distinct and unidentified BGCs different from other members of the genus, and the use of integrative genomic-based approach would be a useful alternative effort to target, isolate and identify putative and undiscovered secondary metabolites suspected to have new and/or specific bioactivity in the Kutzneria.},

 abstract = {The risk of developing drug addiction is strongly influenced by the epigenetic landscape and chromatin remodeling. While histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation have been studied in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens (NAc), the role of H2A monoubiquitination remains unknown. Our investigations, initially focused on the scaffold protein melanoma-associated antigen D1 (Maged1), reveal that H2A monoubiquitination in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) significantly contributes to cocaine-adaptive behaviors and transcriptional repression induced by cocaine. Chronic cocaine use increases H2A monoubiquitination, regulated by Maged1 and its partner USP7. Accordingly, Maged1 specific inactivation in thalamic Vglut2 neurons, or USP7 inhibition, blocks cocaine-evoked H2A monoubiquitination and cocaine locomotor sensitization. Additionally, genetic variations in MAGED1 and USP7 are linked to altered susceptibility to cocaine addiction and cocaine-associated symptoms in humans. These findings unveil an epigenetic modification in a non-canonical reward pathway of the brain and a potent marker of epigenetic risk factors for drug addiction in humans.},

@article{cherrad_new_2023,
 abstract = {Downy mildew is caused by Plasmopara viticola, an obligate oomycete plant pathogen, a devasting disease of grapevine. To protect plants from the disease, complex III inhibitors are among the fungicides widely used. They specifically target the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) of the pathogen to block cellular respiration mechanisms. In the French vineyard, P. viticola has developed resistance against a first group of these fungicides, the Quinone outside Inhibitors (QoI), with a single amino acid substitution G143A in its cytb mitochondrial sequence. The use of QoI was limited and another type of fungicide, the Quinone inside Inhibitors, targeting the same gene and highly effective against oomycetes, was used instead. Recently however, less sensitive P. viticola populations were detected after treatments with some inhibitors, in particular ametoctradin and cyazofamid. By isolating single-sporangia P. viticola strains resistant to these fungicides, we characterized new variants in the cytb sequences associated with cyazofamid resistance: a point mutation (L201S) and more strikingly, two insertions (E203-DE-V204, E203-VE-V204). In parallel with the classical tools, pyrosequencing and qPCR, we then benchmarked short and long-reads NGS technologies (Ion Torrent, Illumina, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to sequence the complete cytb with a view to detecting and assessing the proportion of resistant variants of P. viticola at the scale of a field population. Eighteen populations collected from French vineyard fields in 2020 were analysed: 12 showed a variable proportion of G143A, 11 of E203-DE-V204 and 7 populations of the S34L variant that confers resistance to ametoctradin. Interestingly, the long reads were able to identify variants, including SNPs, with confidence and to detect a small proportion of P. viticola with multiple variants along the same cytb sequence. Overall, NGS appears to be a promising method for assessing fungicide resistance of pathogens linked to cytb modifications at the field population level. This approach could rapidly become a robust decision support tool for resistance management in the future.},

 abstract = {Gall mites (Eriophyoidea) are cosmopolitan microscopic phytoparasites that often transmit viruses and induce gallogenesis. The tribe Calacarini is diagnosed by a set of plesiomorphic and homoplastic traits, including elimination of setae sc shared with other lineages of Eriophyoidea. We reviewed data on the generic diversity of calacarines, revised the concept of the type genus Calacarus Keifer 1940, and proposed three zones (MZ, SMZ, LZ) in the prodorsal shields of calacarines to simplify descriptions of their shield patterns. We describe three new calacarine species (Calacarus baviensisn. sp., C. burchelliaen. sp., and Viginticus searsiaen. sp.) from indigenous dicotyledonous trees from South Africa and Vietnam and report on new findings of Paracalacarus podocarpi Keifer in Brazil, Jiangsuacarus sp. in the USA, and Calacarus pusillus Pye in Latvia and Russia. The latter represents the new most northern locality of Calacarini. Reinvestigating the type species of Jaranasia Chandrapatya \& Boczek 2000 revealed that absence of setae l’’ II is the only character separating it from Jiangsuacarus Xue 2009. We proposed two new combinations: Jiangsuacarus sesleriae (Skoracka 2004) n. comb. (transferred from Jaranasia) and Procalacarus mussaendae (Keifer 1977) n. comb. (transferred from Calacarus). Partial sequences of Cox1 and 28S genes were obtained for six calacarines, some of them originating from old ethanol material kept at room temperature. Molecular phylogenetics revealed a stable cluster of “true” calacarine sequences comprising Calacarus, Jaranasia, Latitudo, and Viginticus and a polyphyletic group of erroneous sequences assigned to Calacarini in GenBank. All investigated females of calacarines have a pair of genital tubules associated with the vestibulum and hypothesized to participate in fertilization. This finding may contribute to resolving the question on how the fusion of gametes happens in gall mites.},

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses one of the greatest global threats in modern history and has already caused severe social and economic costs. The development of efficient and rapid sequencing methods to reconstruct the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been fundamental for the design of diagnostic molecular tests and to devise effective measures and strategies to mitigate the diffusion of the pandemic.Diverse approaches and sequencing methods can, as testified by the number of available sequences, be applied to SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, each technology and sequencing approach has its own advantages and limitations. In the current review, we will provide a brief, but hopefully comprehensive, account of currently available platforms and methodological approaches for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We also present an outline of current repositories and databases that provide access to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and associated metadata. Finally, we offer general advice and guidelines for the appropriate sharing and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 data and metadata, and suggest that more efficient and standardized integration of current and future SARS-CoV-2-related data would greatly facilitate the struggle against this new pathogen. We hope that our ‘vademecum’ for the production and handling of SARS-CoV-2-related sequencing data, will contribute to this objective.},

 abstract = {Ciborinia camelliae Kohn is the causal agent of camellia flower blight. The fungus infects only the flowers of camellias causing serious damage to the plant, particularly from an aesthetic point of view. The disease has been reported in almost all countries where camellia is grown for ornamental purposes, but there are not many studies on the variability of the population of this phytopathogen. The main objective of this study was to contribute to study the level of variability within the Italian population. More than 130 C. camelliae strains were collected from six localities distributed in five Italian regions and identified also based on molecular characterization of the ITS nucleotide sequences. The population variability was assessed by comparing the morphological characters. From a phenological point of view, 11 different colony morphotypes were identified, whose presence/absence and frequency are different in the various locations considered. The study of the taxonomically valid nucleotide sequences to differentiate fungi at the species level confirmed that the strains under study belong to a single species. To further investigate Italian population of C. camelliae we sequenced by a combination of long and short reads technologies the genome of a representative strain. This genome represents a worldwide reference for future C. cameliae diversity and pathogenicity studies.},

Here, we characterize PCI domain-containing 2 (PCID2) protein, a subunit of the transcription and export complex 2 (TREX2) complex, to enforce transcriptional repression and post-transcriptional blocks to HIV-1 gene expression during latency. PCID2 bound the latent HIV-1 LTR (long terminal repeat) and repressed transcription initiation during latency. Depletion of PCID2 remodeled the chromatin landscape at the HIV-1 promoter and resulted in transcriptional activation and latency reversal. Immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry identified PCID2-interacting proteins to include negative viral RNA (vRNA) splicing regulators, and PCID2 depletion resulted in over-splicing of intron-containing vRNA in cell lines and primary cells obtained from PWH. MCM3AP and DSS1, two other RNA-binding TREX2 complex subunits, also inhibit transcription initiation and vRNA alternative splicing during latency. Thus, PCID2 is a novel HIV-1 latency-promoting factor, which in context of the TREX2 sub-complex PCID2-DSS1-MCM3AP blocks transcription and dysregulates vRNA processing.},

 abstract = {Cave animals are an excellent model system for studying adaptive evolution. At present, however, little is known about the mechanisms that enable surface colonizers to survive in the challenging environment of caves. One possibility is that these species have the necessary genetic background to respond with plastic changes to the pressures of underground habitats. To gain insight into this process, we conducted a comparative study with the fish species Telestes karsticus, which occurs in a hydrological system consisting of an interconnected stream and a cave. Results showed that T. karsticus resided year-round and spawned in Sušik cave, making it the first known cavefish in the Dinaric Karst. Cave and surface populations differed in morphological and physiological characteristics, as well as in patterns of gene expression without any evidence of genetic divergence. To test whether observed trait differences were plastic or genetic, we placed adult fish from both populations under light/dark or constant dark conditions. Common laboratory conditions erased all morphometric differences between the two morphs, suggesting phenotypic plasticity is driving the divergence of shape and size in wild fish. Lighter pigmentation and increased fat deposition exhibited by cave individuals were also observed in surface fish kept in the dark in the laboratory. Our study also revealed that specialized cave traits were not solely attributed to developmental plasticity, but also arose from adult responses, including acclimatization. Thus, we conclude that T. karsticus can adapt to cave conditions, with phenotypic plasticity playing an important role in the process of cave colonization.},

 abstract = {Recent studies support the assumption that mutation of the X-linked Pig-a gene is most likely responsible for the mutant phenotype of the cells deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins quantified in the rodent Pig-a gene mutation assay. In humans, however, mutations in both alleles of one of the 30 other genes involved in GPI-anchor synthesis, e.g., PIG-L and PIG-O, cause reduced expression of surface GPI-anchored proteins. Here, we investigated the possibility that the loss of the GPI-anchor detected by the rat Pig-a assay also could be caused by mutation in other GPI-biosynthesis genes. 31 samples were obtained from 8 inbred and outbred rat strains commonly used for genetic toxicology assays. In order to investigate possible sources of variation in the Pig-a assay, variant DNA sequences were evaluated in Cd59 and 24 GPI-biosynthesis genes. In some genes, such as Pig-n and Pig-u, homozygous variations occurred in all animals, suggesting that these variations are due to deviations in the reference genome. Heterozygous Pig-s, Pig-w, Pig-o, Pig-c, Pgap1, Pgap2, Pig-k and Pig-t variations were found, however, indicating that these genes could serve as targets for mutation in the assay. Protein alignment for these altered genes was conducted with possible human, mouse and rat phenotypic mutants from the literature; this analysis demonstrated that many of the variations that we detected were in non-conserved sequences and that no phenotypes for any of these variants could be inferred from known mutants from the literature. All heterozygous variants were in outbred rats. Overall, the findings of this study cannot totally rule out the possibility that mutations in GPI-biosynthesis genes other than Pig-a are detected in the Pig-a assay, but suggest that if it occurs, it must occur only rarely and therefore mutations in genes other than Pig-a have little impact on rat-based experiments.},

The role(s) in virulence of Fg genes include genetic studies that involve the transformation of the fungus with different expression cassettes. We have observed in several studies where Fg genes functions were characterised that integration of expression cassettes occurred randomly. Random insertion of a cassette may disrupt gene expression and/or protein functions and hence the overall conclusion of the study. Target site integration (TSI) is an approach that consists of identifying a chromosomal region where the cassette can be inserted. The identification of a suitable locus for TSI in Fg would avert the potential risks of ectopic integration.},

@article{darkow_small_2021,
 abstract = {In search of more efficacious and safe pharmacological treatments for atrial fibrillation (AF), atria-selective antiarrhythmic agents have been promoted that target ion channels principally expressed in the atria. This concept allows one to engage antiarrhythmic effects in atria, but spares the ventricles from potentially proarrhythmic side effects. It has been suggested that cardiac small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels may represent an atria-selective target in mammals including humans. However, there are conflicting data concerning the expression of SK channels in different stages of AF, and recent findings suggest that SK channels are upregulated in ventricular myocardium when patients develop heart failure. To address this issue, RNA-sequencing was performed to compare expression levels of three SK channels (KCNN1, KCNN2, and KCNN3) in human atrial and ventricular tissue samples from transplant donor hearts (no cardiac disease), and patients with cardiac disease in sinus rhythm or with AF. In addition, for control purposes expression levels of several genes known to be either chamber-selective or differentially expressed in AF and heart failure were determined. In atria, as compared to ventricle from transplant donor hearts, we confirmed higher expression of KCNN1 and KCNA5, and lower expression of KCNJ2, whereas KCNN2 and KCNN3 were statistically not differentially expressed. Overall expression of KCNN1 was low compared to KCNN2 and KCNN3. Comparing atrial tissue from patients with AF to sinus rhythm samples we saw downregulation of KCNN2 in AF, as previously reported. When comparing ventricular tissue from heart failure patients to non-diseased samples, we found significantly increased ventricular expression of KCNN3 in heart failure, as previously published. The other channels showed no significant difference in expression in either disease. Our results add weight to the view that SK channels are not likely to be an atria-selective target, especially in failing human hearts, and modulators of these channels may prove to have less utility in treating AF than hoped. Whether targeting SK1 holds potential remains to be elucidated.},

 abstract = {This study analyzes the genomic findings of the first report of Salmonella isolate carrying the blaCTX-M-55 gene, recovered from a bacteremic patient from Brazil. A bacterial isolate positive for the blaCTX-M-55 gene was submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion and epsilometric test. Whole genome sequencing was performed using Illumina technology. Conjugation assay was performed; plasmid sizes determined by S1-PFGE and plasmid content were investigated by hybrid assembly after MinION long reads sequencing. Isolate 288\_18 was identified as sequence type ST13, resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and aztreonam. A transferable IncFII plasmid sized approximately 67 kb was found to carry the blaTEM-1 and blaCTX-M-55 in a module consisting of IS26-blaTEM-1B-WbuC-blaCTX-M-55-IS26. In addition, an 117 kb IncI1plasmid was also identified in the 288\_18 isolate, but without additional resistance genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of blaCTX-M-55 in Salmonella isolated from human infection in Brazil. The occurrence of blaCTX-M-55 in the IncFII epidemic plasmid in a relevant clinical human isolate of Salmonella Agona underscores the urgent need for enhanced and effective continuous surveillance for controlling its dissemination.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND:
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an acquired genetic risk factor for both leukemia and cardiovascular disease. It results in proinflammatory myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood; however, how these cells behave in the cardiovascular tissue remains unclear. Our study aimed at investigating whether CHIP-mutated macrophages accumulate preferentially in cardiovascular tissues and examining the transcriptome of tissue macrophages from DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha) or TET2 (Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) mutation carriers.
METHODS:
We recruited patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or heart surgeries to screen for CHIP mutation carriers using targeted genomic sequencing. Myeloid and lymphoid cells were isolated from blood and cardiovascular tissue collected during surgeries using flow cytometry. DNA and RNA extracted from these sorted cells were subjected to variant allele frequency measurement using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and transcriptomic profiling using bulk RNA sequencing, respectively.
RESULTS:
Using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, we detected similar variant allele frequency of CHIP in monocytes from blood and macrophages from atheromas and heart tissues, even among heart macrophages with and without CCR2 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 2) expression. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a proinflammatory gene profile of myeloid cells from DNMT3A or TET2 mutation carriers compared with those from noncarriers.
CONCLUSIONS:
Quantitatively, CHIP-mutated myeloid cells did not preferentially accumulate in cardiovascular tissues, but qualitatively, they expressed a more disease-prone phenotype.},

@article{dehghanian_zfp982_2024,
 abstract = {Background
Understanding the genetic underpinnings of protein networks conferring stemness is of broad interest for basic and translational research.
Methods
We used multi-omics analyses to identify and characterize stemness genes, and focused on the zinc finger protein 982 (Zfp982) that regulates stemness through the expression of Nanog, Zfp42, and Dppa3 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC).
Results
Zfp982 was expressed in stem cells, and bound to chromatin through a GCAGAGKC motif, for example near the stemness genes Nanog, Zfp42, and Dppa3. Nanog and Zfp42 were direct targets of ZFP982 that decreased in expression upon knockdown and increased upon overexpression of Zfp982. We show that ZFP982 expression strongly correlated with stem cell characteristics, both on the transcriptional and morphological levels. Zfp982 expression decreased with progressive differentiation into ecto-, endo- and mesodermal cell lineages, and knockdown of Zfp982 correlated with morphological and transcriptional features of differentiated cells. Zfp982 showed transcriptional overlap with members of the Hippo signaling pathway, one of which was Yap1, the major co-activator of Hippo signaling. Despite the observation that ZFP982 and YAP1 interacted and localized predominantly to the cytoplasm upon differentiation, the localization of YAP1 was not influenced by ZFP982 localization.
Conclusions
Together, our study identified ZFP982 as a transcriptional regulator of early stemness genes, and since ZFP982 is under the control of the Hippo pathway, underscored the importance of the context-dependent Hippo signals for stem cell characteristics.},

New sequencing technologies make it possible to investigate genomic variations associated with resistant phenotypes at the genome-wide scale. Based on the use of hemisynthetic nanopores, the PromethION technology from Oxford Nanopore Technologies can produce long-read sequences, in contrast to previous short-read technologies used as the gold standard to sequence Plasmodium. Two clones of P. falciparum (Pf3D7 and PfW2) were sequenced in long-read using the PromethION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies without genomic amplification. This made it possible to create a processing analysis pipeline for human Plasmodium with ONT Fastq only. De novo assembly revealed N50 lengths of 18,488 kb and 17,502 kb for the Pf3D7 and PfW2, respectively. The genome size was estimated at 23,235,407 base pairs for the Pf3D7 clone and 21,712,038 base pairs for the PfW2 clone. The average genome coverage depth was estimated at 787X and 653X for the Pf3D7 and PfW2 clones, respectively. This study proposes an assembly processing pipeline for the human Plasmodium genome using software adapted to large ONT data and the high AT percentage of Plasmodium. This search provides all the parameters which were optimized for use with the software selected in the pipeline.},

Here, we analyzed the regulatory landscape of cardiac endothelial cells by assessing chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and 3D chromatin organization and confirmed the functional relevance of enhancer-promoter interactions by CRISPRi-mediated enhancer silencing. We used this dataset to explore mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in cardiovascular disease and compared six different experimental models of heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes. Enhancers that regulate gene expression in diseased endothelial cells were enriched with binding sites for a distinct set of transcription factors, including the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a known drug target in heart failure and hypertension. For proof of concept, we applied endothelial cell-specific MR deletion in mice to confirm MR-dependent gene expression and predicted direct MR target genes. Overall, we have compiled here a comprehensive atlas of cardiac endothelial cell enhancer elements that provides insight into the role of transcription factors in cardiovascular disease.},

A stable, in vitro cardiac endothelial cell line could provide high cell numbers as needed for many epigenetic analyses and facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial cell biology. To test their suitability for transcriptomic or epigenetic studies, we compared the transcriptome of cultured immortalized mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) to primary cardiac endothelial cells (pEC). Whole transcriptome comparison of MCEC and pEC showed a correlation of 0.75–0.77. Interestingly, correlation of gene expression declined in endothelial cell-typical genes. In MCEC, we found a broad downregulation of genes that are highly expressed in pEC, including well-described markers of endothelial cell differentiation. Accordingly, systematic analysis revealed a downregulation of genes associated with typical endothelial cell functions in MCEC, while genes related to mitotic cell cycle were upregulated when compared to pEC. In conclusion, the findings from this study suggest that primary cardiac endothelial cells should preferably be used for genome-wide transcriptome or epigenome studies. The suitability of in vitro cell lines for experiments investigating single genes or signaling pathways should be carefully validated before use.},

However, current in vivo editing of endogenous genes either lacks flexibility or is limited to discrete codons and short gene fragments, preventing a comprehensive exploration of genotype-phenotype relationships. To enable facile saturation editing of full-length genes, we used a protospacer adjacent motif–relaxed Cas9 variant and homology-directed repair to achieve above 60\% user-defined codon replacement efficiencies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Coupled with massively parallel DNA design and synthesis, we developed a saturation gene editing method termed CRISPR-Cas9– and homology-directed repair–assisted saturation editing (CHASE) and achieved highly saturated codon swapping of long genomic regions. By applying CHASE to massively edit a well-studied global transcription factor gene, we found known and unreported genetic variants affecting an industrially relevant microbial trait. The user-defined codon editing capability and wide targeting windows of CHASE substantially expand the scope of saturation gene editing.},

However, it still has ambiguous scientific multiple names, such as Azadirachta excelsa , Protium javanicum , and Dysoxylum mollissimum. Additional tools such as molecular approaches can be used to verify whether it is true or not that Kayu bawang is scientifically named as Azadirachta excelsa based on previous morphological identification. This study aimed to construct draft chloroplast genome and verify the scientific name based on molecular identification using a single rbc L gene marker. Genomic DNA was extracted from bark cambium originated from three different provenances in Bengkulu, Indonesia, namely TBT-A, TBT-K, and TBT-S. MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies was used to sequence the samples following manufacture protocols SQK-LSK109 yielding 481.6 Mb for TBT-A, 597.4 Mb for TBT-K, and 853.1 Mb for TBT-S, respectively. Generated data were assembled and constructed, namely 58,780 bp (14 tRNAs and 47 encoding genes) for TBT-A, 142,139 bp (4 rRNAs, 24 tRNAs, and 78 encoding genes) for TBT-K, and 84,906 bp (24 tRNAs and 53 encoding genes) for TBT-S.

In a pan-cancer analysis, we curated and analysed 3,412 nonstop mutations from 62 tumour entities, generating a comprehensive database at http://NonStopDB.dkfz.de. Six different nonstop extension mutations affected the tumour suppressor SMAD4, extending its carboxy terminus by 40 amino acids. These caused rapid degradation of the SMAD4 mutants via the ubiquitin–proteasome system. A hydrophobic degron signal sequence of ten amino acids within the carboxy-terminal extension was required to induce complete loss of the SMAD4 protein. Thus, we discovered that nonstop mutations can be functionally important in cancer and characterize their loss-of-function impact on the tumour suppressor SMAD4.},

We collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of paired APA and concurrent aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCCs) (n = 6).DNA methylation levels were evaluated by quantitative bisulfite next-generation sequencing in fresh-frozen tissues (CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17A1, CYP21A2, HSD3B1, HSD3B2, NR5A1, STAR, and TSPO) and FFPE APA/APCC paired samples (CYP11B2). CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17, CYP21, and STAR gene expressions were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.The main outcome measure was DNA methylation.CYP11B2 methylation levels were significantly lower in APA than in other adrenal tissues (P \&lt; .001). Methylation levels of the remaining genes were comparable among groups. Overall, CYP11B2 expression and DNA methylation were negatively correlated (ρ = –0.379; P = .003). In FFPE-paired APA/APCC samples, CYP11B2 methylation level was significantly lower in APA than in concurrent APCCs (P = .028).DNA methylation plays a regulatory role for CYP11B2 expression and may contribute to aldosterone hypersecretion in APA. Lower CYP11B2 methylation levels in APA than in APCCs may suggest an APCC-to-APA switch via progressive CYP11B2 demethylation. Conversely, DNA methylation seems not to be relevant in regulating the expression of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes other than CYP11B2.},

 abstract = {Necrosis- and ethylene-inducing proteins are effector molecules of microorganisms able to induce cell death in plant tissues and/or ethylene biosynthesis. The fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, which causes the witches' broom disease in Theobroma cacao, contains five genes that encode these proteins (MpNep1-5) in its genome. Among these, MpNep2 is the most expressed Nep during disease's development, especially in the necrotic phase. Although widely studied, little is known about the mechanisms by which these proteins induce cell death. In this perspective, the present study aimed to identify potential MpNEP2 target proteins in protein extracts of Theobroma cacao (genotype Catongo) and propose, from the results achieved, mechanisms by which MpNEP2 can induce the process of cell death. Molecular targets captured in vitro by rMpNEP2 immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose were identified by ms/ms. Candidate targets were identified as an Auxin Response Factor, Sphingosine Kinase and a Formin like protein. These proteins are known to participate in important processes in primary metabolism, molecular function and regulation of the plant's response. The targets:MpNEP2 interactions were validated in silico. We discussed the different signaling pathways, membrane modulation and cell cytoskeleton, by which MpNEP2 can act and induce responses in the plant that leads to necrosis.},

 abstract = {Influenza type A virus (IAV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during influenza epidemics. Recently, a specific link between IAV infection and neurodegenerative disease progression has been established. The non-structural NS1 protein of IAV regulates viral replication during infection and antagonizes host antiviral responses, contributing to influenza virulence. In the present study, we have prepared a mouse lung-to-lung adapted to the NS1-truncated virus (NS80ad). Transcriptome analysis of the gene expression in the lungs revealed that infection with wild-type A/WSN/33 (WSN), NS80, and NS80ad viruses resulted in different regulation of genes involved in signaling pathways associated with the cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and development of neurodegenerative diseases. NS1 protein did not influence the genes involved in the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway in the brains. Lethal infection with IAVs dysregulated expression of proteins associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases (CX3CL1/Fractalkine, Coagulation factor III, and CD105/Endoglin, CD54/ICAM-1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, IGFBP-5, IGFBP-6, chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Osteopontin (OPN), cystatin C, and LDL R). Transcription of GATA3 mRNA was decreased, and expression of MPO was inhibited in the brain infected with NS80 and NS80ad viruses. In addition, the truncation of NS1 protein led to reduced expression of IGFBP-2, CHI3L1, MPO, and LDL-R proteins in the brains. Our results indicate that the influenza virus influences the expression of proteins involved in brain function, and this might occur mostly through the NS1 protein. These findings suggest that the abovementioned proteins represent a promising target for the development of potentially effective immunotherapy against neurodegeneration.},

 abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the major causes of cancer-associated deaths worldwide, with a dismal prognosis that has not significantly changed over the last decades. Transcriptional analysis has provided valuable insights into pancreatic tumorigenesis. Specifically, pancreatic cancer subtypes were identified, characterized by specific mutations and gene expression changes associated with differences in patient survival. In addition to differentially regulated mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were shown to have subtype-specific expression patterns. Hence, we aimed to characterize prognostic lncRNAs with deregulated expression in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which has the worst prognosis. Extensive in silico analyses followed by in vitro experiments identified long intergenic non-coding RNA 261 (LINC00261) as a downregulated lncRNA in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which is generally associated with transforming growth factor \&beta; (TGF\&beta;) signaling in human cancer cells. Its genomic neighbor, the transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), regulated LINC00261 expression by direct binding of the LINC00261 promoter. CRISPR-mediated knockdown and promoter knockout validated the importance of LINC00261 in TGF\&beta;-mediated epithelial\&ndash;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and established the epithelial marker E-cadherin, an important cell adhesion protein, as a downstream target of LINC00261. Consequently, depletion of LINC00261 enhanced motility and invasiveness of PANC-1 cells in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that LINC00261 is an important tumor-suppressive lncRNA in PDAC that is involved in maintaining a pro-epithelial state associated with favorable disease outcome.},

Hydration is the key trigger to initiate germination, but the mechanism by which seeds sense water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates upon hydration and allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that biophysical states of FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo in suppressing seed germination under unfavorable environments. We find intragenic, intraspecific, and interspecific natural variation in FLOE1 expression and phase separation and show that intragenic variation is associated with adaptive germination strategies in natural populations. This combination of molecular, organismal, and ecological studies uncovers FLOE1 as a tunable environmental sensor with direct implications for the design of drought-resistant crops, in the face of climate change.},

 abstract = {The DNA methyltransferase DNMT3C appeared as a duplication of the DNMT3B gene in muroids and is required for silencing of young retrotransposons in the male germline. Using specialized assay systems, we investigate the flanking sequence preferences of DNMT3C and observe characteristic preferences for cytosine at the -2 and -1 flank that are unique among DNMT3 enzymes. We identify two amino acids in the catalytic domain of DNMT3C (C543 and V547) that are responsible for the DNMT3C-specific flanking sequence preferences and evolutionary conserved in muroids. Reanalysis of published data shows that DNMT3C flanking preferences are consistent with genome-wide methylation patterns in mouse ES cells only expressing DNMT3C. Strikingly, we show that CpG sites with the preferred flanking sequences of DNMT3C are enriched in murine retrotransposons that were previously identified as DNMT3C targets. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that DNMT3C has elevated methylation activity on substrates derived from these biological targets. Our data show that DNMT3C flanking sequence preferences match the sequences of young murine retrotransposons which facilitates their methylation. By this, our data provide mechanistic insights into the molecular co-evolution of repeat elements and (epi)genetic defense systems dedicated to maintain genomic stability in mammals.},

 abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is a powerful source of innovations in prokaryotes that can affect almost any cellular system, including microbial organelles. The formation of magnetosomes, one of the most sophisticated microbial mineral-containing organelles synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria for magnetic navigation in the environment, was also shown to be a horizontally transferrable trait. However, the mechanisms determining the fate of such genes in new hosts are not well understood, since non-adaptive gene acquisitions are typically rapidly lost and become unavailable for observation. This likely explains why gene clusters encoding magnetosome biosynthesis have never been observed in non-magnetotactic bacteria. Here, we report the first discovery of a horizontally inherited dormant gene clusters encoding biosynthesis of magnetosomes in a non-magnetotactic phototrophic bacterium Rhodovastum atsumiense. We show that these clusters were inactivated through transcriptional silencing and antisense RNA regulation, but retain functionality, as several genes were able to complement the orthologous deletions in a remotely related magnetotactic bacterium. The laboratory transfer of foreign magnetosome genes to R. atsumiense was found to endow the strain with magnetosome biosynthesis, but strong negative selection led to rapid loss of this trait upon subcultivation, highlighting the trait instability in this organism. Our results provide insight into the horizontal dissemination of gene clusters encoding complex prokaryotic organelles and illuminate the potential mechanisms of their genomic preservation in a dormant state.},

In most studied species with compound leaves, class 1 KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX genes expressed in developing leaf primordia sustain morphogenetic activity, allowing leaf dissection and the development of leaflets. Other genes, such as, SINGLE LEAFLET1 in Medicago truncatula and Trifoliate in Solanum lycopersicum, are also implicated in regulating compound leaf patterning. To set the pace for an in-depth understanding of the genetics of compound leaf development in cowpea, we applied RNA-seq and whole genome shotgun sequence datasets of a spontaneous cowpea unifoliate mutant and its trifoliate wild-type cultivar to conduct comparative reference-based gene expression, de novo genome-wide isoform switch, and genome variant analyses between the two genotypes. Our results suggest that genomic variants upstream of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and down-stream of REVEILLE4, BRASSINOSTERIOD INSENSITIVE1 and LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES result in down-regulation of key components of cowpea circadian rhythm central oscillator and brassinosteroid signaling, resulting in unifoliate leaves and brassinosteroid-deficient-like phenotypes.

One approach relies on the definition of families, which can be encoded as covariance models (CMs) or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). While being powerful tools, their complexity makes it tedious to investigate them in their (default) tabulated form. This specifically applies to the interpretation of comparisons between multiple models as in family clans. The Covariance model visualization tools (CMV) visualize CMs or HMMs to: I) Obtain an easily interpretable representation of HMMs and CMs; II) Put them in context with the structural sequence alignments they have been created from; III) Investigate results of model comparisons and highlight regions of interest.AvailabilitySource code (http://www.github.com/eggzilla/cmv), web-service (http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CMVS) Contactegg@informatik.uni-freiburg.de, choener@bioinf.uni-leipzig.deSupplementary informationSupplementary data available online.},

Although the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) has a well-established role in safeguarding liver function and its cistrome spans around 50\% of liver-specific genes, its role in the acute-phase response has received little attention so far. We demonstrate that HNF4A binds to and represses acute-phase genes under basal conditions. The reprogramming of hepatic transcription during inflammation necessitates loss of HNF4A function to allow expression of acute-phase genes while liver homeostatic genes are repressed. In a pre-clinical liver organoid model overexpression of HNF4A maintained liver functionality in spite of inflammation-induced cell damage. Conversely, HNF4A overexpression potently impaired the acute-phase response by retaining chromatin at regulatory regions of acute-phase genes inaccessible to transcription. Taken together, our data extend the understanding of dual HNF4A action as transcriptional activator and repressor, establishing HNF4A as gatekeeper for the hepatic acute-phase response.},

 abstract = {Background: Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a malignant soft tissue tumor of mesenchymal origin that frequently occurs in young adults. Translocation of the SYT gene on chromosome 18 to the SSX genes on chromosome X leads to the formation of oncogenic fusion genes, which lead to initiation and proliferation of tumor cells. The detection and quantification of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can serve as a non-invasive method for diagnostics of local or distant tumor recurrence, which could improve survival rates due to early detection. Methods: We developed a subtype-specific targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach specifically targeting SS t(X;18)(p11;q11), which fuses SS18 (SYT) in chromosome 18 to SSX1 or SSX2 in chromosome x, and recurrent point mutations. In addition, patient-specific panels were designed from tumor exome sequencing. Both approaches were used to quantify ctDNA in patients’ plasma. Results: The subtype-specific assay allowed detection of somatic mutations from 25/25 tumors with a mean of 1.68 targetable mutations. The minimal limit of detection was determined at a variant allele frequency of 0.05\%. Analysis of 29 plasma samples from 15 tumor patients identified breakpoint ctDNA in 6 patients (sensitivity: 40\%, specificity 100\%). The addition of more mutations further increased assay sensitivity. Quantification of ctDNA in plasma samples (n = 11) from one patient collected over 3 years, with a patient-specific panel based on tumor exome sequencing, correlated with the clinical course, response to treatment and tumor volume. Conclusions: Targeted NGS allows for highly sensitive tumor profiling and non-invasive detection of ctDNA in SS patients, enabling non-invasive monitoring of tumor dynamics.},

Eliciting these responses and coordinating the necessary energy shifts likely involves retrograde signalling by mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs). Members of the group were suggested before to play a role in heterothermic physiology, a key component of hibernation and daily torpor. Here we studied the mitochondrial single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) m.3017C{\textgreater}T that resides in the evolutionarily conserved gene MT-SHLP6. The substitution occurring in several mammalian orders causes truncation of SHLP6 peptide size from twenty to nine amino acids. Public mass spectrometric (MS) data of human SHLP6 indicated a canonical size of 20 amino acids, but not the use of alternative translation initiation codons that would expand the peptide. The shorter isoform of SHLP6 was found in heterothermic rodents at higher frequency compared to homeothermic rodents (p {\textless} 0.001). In heterothermic mammals it was associated with lower minimal body temperature (Tb, p {\textless} 0.001). In the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, brown adipose tissue—a key organ required for hibernation, showed dynamic changes of the steady-state transcript level of mt-Shlp6. The level was significantly higher before hibernation and during interbout arousal and lower during torpor and after hibernation. Our finding argues to further explore the mode of action of SHLP6 size isoforms with respect to mammalian thermoregulation and possibly mitochondrial retrograde signalling.},

The assembly findings indicate that strain LGMB417 possesses a genome size of 4,654,011 bp, with a G + C content of 66.50\%. The draft genome sequence revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites and carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), glycoside hydrolases (23), glycosyltransferases (18), carbohydrate esterases (5), polysaccharide lyases (2), carbohydrate-binding modules (2), and auxiliary activities (1). Several genes related to growth promotion were found in the genome, including those associated with phosphate transport and solubilization, nitrogen metabolism, siderophore production and iron transport, hormonal modulation, stress responses (such as to drought, temperature fluctuations, osmotic challenges, and oxidative conditions), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Subsequent phases will encompass investigations utilizing gene expression methodologies, with future explorations concentrating on facets pertinent to agricultural production, including comprehensive field studies.},

 abstract = {Apolipoprotein E ({\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater}) is a key regulator of lipoprotein metabolism, and consequently, affects the plasma and tissue lipid contents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the parallel effects of {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} genetic variants and promoter methylation levels of six CpGs on the risk of diabetic dyslipidemia. A total of 204 Palestinian type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients (mean age ± SD: 62.7±10.2) were enrolled in the present study (n=96 with dyslipidemia and n=108 without dyslipidemia). Next generation sequencing was performed to analyze five single nucleotide polymorphisms: Two variants rs7412 and rs429358 that determine {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} ε alleles, and three variants in the promoter region (rs769446, rs449647, and rs405509). For all subjects, the most common genotype was ε3/ε3 (79.4\%). No statistical differences were observed in the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} ε polymorphisms and the three promoter variants among T2D patients with and without dyslipidemia (P\&gt;0.05). A comparison of lipid parameters between ε3/ε3 subjects and ε4 carriers in both groups revealed no significant differences in the mean values of LDL‑C, HDL‑C, TG, and TC levels (P\&gt;0.05). Six CpG sites in the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} promoter on chromosome 19:44905755‑44906078 were identified, and differential DNA methylation in these CpGs were observed between the study groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association of DNA methylation level at the six CpGs with an increased risk of diabetic dyslipidemia (odds ratio, 1.038; 95\% confidence interval, 1.012‑1.064; P=0.004). In conclusion, the present study revealed that DNA methylation levels in six CpGs in the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} promoter region was associated with the risk of diabetic dyslipidemia independently of the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} ε4 variant which could be a potential therapeutic target to reverse the methylation of the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} promoter.},

 abstract = {The present investigation utilized in silico methodologies to explore the diverse pharmacological activities, toxicity profiles, and chemical reactivity of a series of fluoro-flavonoid compounds (1–14), which are secondary metabolites of plants known for their broad range of biological effects. A comprehensive strategy is utilized, incorporating methods such as prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS) prediction, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) assessments, and density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations using three basis sets: 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), and 6-311++G(d,p). Furthermore, the study employed molecular docking technique to identify target proteins, including HER2 (7JXH), EGFR (4UV7), FPPS (1YQ7), HPGDS (1V40), DCK (1P60), and KEAP1 on Nrf2 (1X2J), for the investigated compounds, with cianidanol and genistein serving as reference drugs for the docking process. The investigated fluoro-flavonoid compounds exhibited significantly greater binding affinities (ranging from −8.3 to −10.6 kcal mol−1) toward HER2, HPGDS, and KEAP1 compared to the reference drugs, cianidanol and genistein, which displayed binding affinities ranging from −8.4 to −9.4 kcal mol−1. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand interaction, using the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg) parameters and principle component analysis (PCA). Among the tested fluoro-flavonoid analogs, analog 11 showed a RMSD value of .15 nm with the HER2 protein target, indicating a stable interaction. Based on in silico results, it appears that the fluoro-flavonoid compound 11 has the potential to serve as a targeted anti-lung cancer drug. However, additional in vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.},

 abstract = {The aerial surfaces of plants harbour diverse communities of microorganisms. The rising awareness concerning the potential roles of these phyllosphere microbiota for airborne pollutant remediation and plant growth promotion, advocates for a better understanding of their community structure and dynamics in urban ecosystems. Here, we characterised the epiphytic microbial communities on leaves of Platanus x hispanica trees in the city centre of Hasselt (Belgium), and the nearby forest area of Bokrijk, Genk (Belgium). We compared the influences of season, site, and air pollutants concentration variations on the tree’s phyllosphere microbiome by determining the intra- and inter-individual variation in leaf bacterial communities. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed large variation in the bacterial community structure and diversity throughout the years but also allowed to discriminate an environment effect on community assembly. Partial drivers for this environment effect on composition can be correlated with the huge differences in ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) and black carbon on the leaves. A change in bacterial community composition was noted for trees growing in the city centre compared to the natural site, and also more human-associated genera were found colonising the leaves from the city centre. These integrated results offer an original and first insight in the Platanus phyllomicrobiota, which can offer new opportunities to use phyllosphere microorganisms to enhance air pollution degradation.},

 abstract = {Owls (Strigiformes) evolved speciﬁc adaptations to their nocturnal predatory lifestyle, such as asymmetrical ears, a facial disk, and a feather structure allowing silent ﬂight. Owls also share some traits with diurnal raptors and other nocturnal birds, such as cryptic plumage patterns, reversed sexual size dimorphism, and acute vision and hearing. The genetic basis of some of these adaptations to a nocturnal predatory lifestyle has been studied by candidate gene approaches but rarely with genome-wide scans. Here, we used a genome-wide comparative analysis to test for selection in the early history of the owls. We estimated the substitution rates in the coding regions of 20 bird genomes, including 11 owls of which ﬁve were newly sequenced. Then, we tested for functional overrepresentation across the genes that showed signals of selection. In the ancestral branch of the owls, we found traces of positive selection in the evolution of genes functionally related to visual perception, especially to phototransduction, and to chromosome packaging. Several genes that have been previously linked to acoustic perception, circadian rhythm, and feather structure also showed signals of an accelerated evolution in the origin of the owls. We discuss the functions of the genes under positive selection and their putative association with the adaptation to the nocturnal predatory lifestyle of the owls.},

 abstract = {Mutations of cilia-associated molecules cause multiple developmental defects that are collectively termed ciliopathies. However, several ciliary proteins, involved in gating access to the cilium, also assume localizations at other cellular sites including the nucleus, where they participate in DNA damage responses to maintain tissue integrity. Molecular insight into how these molecules execute such diverse functions remains limited. A mass spectrometry screen for ANKS6-interacting proteins suggested an involvement of ANKS6 in RNA processing and/or binding. Comparing the RNA-binding properties of the known RNA-binding protein BICC1 with the three ankyrin-repeat proteins ANKS3, ANKS6 (NPHP16) and INVERSIN (NPHP2) confirmed that certain nephronophthisis (NPH) family members can interact with RNA molecules. We also observed that BICC1 and INVERSIN associate with stress granules in response to translational inhibition. Furthermore, BICC1 recruits ANKS3 and ANKS6 into TIA-1-positive stress granules after exposure to hippuristanol. Our findings uncover a novel function of NPH family members, and provide further evidence that NPH family members together with BICC1 are involved in stress responses to maintain tissue and organ integrity.},

 abstract = {Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the most commonly used technique in explorative proteomic research. A variety of open-source tools for peptide-spectrum matching have become available. Most analyses of explorative MS data are performed using conventional settings, such as fully specific enzymatic constraints. Here we evaluated the impact of the fragment mass tolerance in combination with the enzymatic constraints on the performance of three search engines. Three open-source search engines (Myrimatch, X! Tandem, and MSGF+) were evaluated concerning the suitability in semi- and unspecific searches as well as the importance of accurate fragment mass spectra in non-specific peptide searches. We then performed a semispecific reanalysis of the published NCI-60 deep proteome data applying the most suited parameters. Semi- and unspecific LC-MS/MS data analyses particularly benefit from accurate fragment mass spectra while this effect is less pronounced for conventional, fully specific peptide-spectrum matching. Search speed differed notably between the three search engines for semi- and non-specific peptide-spectrum matching. Semispecific reanalysis of NCI-60 proteome data revealed hundreds of previously undescribed N-terminal peptides, including cases of proteolytic processing or likely alternative translation start sites, some of which were ubiquitously present in all cell lines of the reanalyzed panel. Highly accurate MS2 fragment data in combination with modern open-source search algorithms enable the confident identification of semispecific peptides from large proteomic datasets. The identification of previously undescribed N-terminal peptides in published studies highlights the potential of future reanalysis and data mining in proteomic datasets.},

We performed functional characterization of a promising candidate effector of M. perniciosa. The inoculation of rBASIDIN at 4 µmol L−1 in the mesophyll of leaflets of Solanum lycopersicum caused symptoms of shriveling within 6 h without the presence of necrosis. However, when sprayed on the plant at a concentration of 11 µmol L−1, it caused wilting symptoms only 2 h after application, followed by necrosis and cell death at 48 h. rBASIDIN applied to Theobroma cacao leaves at the same concentration caused milder symptoms. rBASIDIN caused hydrogen peroxide production in leaf tissue, damaging the leaf membrane and negatively affecting the photosynthetic rate of Solanum lycopersicum plants. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BASIDIN has orthologs in other phytopathogenic basidiomycetes. Analysis of the transcripts revealed that BASIDIN and its orthologs are expressed in different fungal species, suggesting that this protein is differentially regulated in these basidiomycetes. Therefore, the results of applying BASIDIN allow the inference that it is an effector of the fungus M. perniciosa, with a strong potential to interfere in the defense system of the host plant.},

 abstract = {Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger proteins (KZNFs) recognize and repress transposable elements (TEs); TEs are DNA elements that are capable of replicating themselves throughout our genomes with potentially harmful consequences. However, genes from this family of transcription factors have a much wider potential for genomic regulation. KZNFs have become integrated into gene-regulatory networks through the control of TEs that function as enhancers and gene promoters; some KZNFs also bind directly to gene promoters, suggesting an additional, more direct layer of KZNF co-option into gene-regulatory networks. Binding site analysis of ZNF519, ZNF441, and ZNF468 suggests the structural evolution of KZNFs to recognize TEs can result in coincidental binding to gene promoters independent of TE sequences. We show a higher rate of sequence turnover in gene promoter KZNF binding sites than neighboring regions, implying a selective pressure is being applied by the binding of a KZNF. Through CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic deletion of ZNF519, ZNF441, and ZNF468, we provide further evidence for genome-wide co-option of the KZNF-mediated gene-regulatory functions; KZNF knockout leads to changes in expression of KZNF-bound genes in neuronal lineages. Finally, we show that the opposite can be established upon KZNF overexpression, further strengthening the support for the role of KZNFs as bona-fide gene regulators. With no eminent role for ZNF519 in controlling its TE target, our study may provide a snapshot into the early stages of the completed co-option of a KZNF, showing the lasting, multilayered impact that retrovirus invasions and host response mechanisms can have upon the evolution of our genomes.},

 abstract = {The large family of KRAB zinc finger (KZNF) genes are transcription factors implicated in recognizing and repressing repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs) in our genome. Through successive waves of retrotransposition-mediated insertions, various classes of TEs have invaded mammalian genomes at multiple timepoints throughout evolution. Even though most of the TE classes in our genome lost the capability to retrotranspose millions of years ago, it remains elusive why the KZNFs that evolved to repress them are still retained in our genome. One hypothesis is that KZNFs become repurposed for other regulatory roles. Here, we find evidence that evolutionary changes in KZNFs provide them not only with the ability to repress TEs, but also to bind to gene promoters independent of TEs. Using KZNF binding site data in conjunction with gene expression values from the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that KZNFs have the ability to regulate gene expression in the human brain in a region-specific manner. Our analysis shows that the expression of KZNFs shows correlation with the expression of their target genes, suggesting that KZNFs have a direct influence on gene expression in the developing human brain. The extent of this regulation and the impact it has on primate brain evolution are still to be determined, but our results imply that KZNFs have become widely integrated into neuronal gene regulatory networks. Our analysis predicts that gene expression networks have been repeatedly innovated throughout primate evolution, continuously gaining new layers of gene regulation mediated by both TEs and KZNFs in our genome.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Crossroads between transposons and gene regulation’.},

 abstract = {Elusive aquatic wildlife, such as endangered sea turtles, are difficult to monitor and conserve. As novel molecular and genetic technologies develop, it is possible to adapt and optimize them for wildlife conservation. One such technology is environmental (e)DNA – the detection of DNA shed from organisms into their surrounding environments. We developed species-specific green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle probe-based qPCR assays, which can detect and quantify sea turtle eDNA in controlled (captive tank water and sand samples) and free ranging (oceanic water samples and nesting beach sand) settings. eDNA detection complemented traditional in-water sea turtle monitoring by enabling detection even when turtles were not visually observed. Furthermore, we report that high throughput shotgun sequencing of eDNA sand samples enabled sea turtle population genetic studies and pathogen monitoring, demonstrating that noninvasive eDNA techniques are viable and efficient alternatives to biological sampling (e.g., biopsies and blood draws). Genetic information was obtained from sand many hours after nesting events, without having to observe or interact with the target individual. This greatly reduces the sampling stress experienced by nesting mothers and emerging hatchlings, and avoids sacrificing viable eggs for genetic analysis. The detection of pathogens from sand indicates significant potential for increased wildlife disease monitoring capacity and viral variant surveillance. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of eDNA approaches to ultimately help understand and conserve threatened species such as sea turtles.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT


Reef-building corals depend on symbiosis with photosynthetic algae that reside within their cells. As important as this relationship is for maintaining healthy reefs, it is strikingly delicate. When ocean temperatures briefly exceed the average summer maximum, corals can bleach, losing their endosymbionts. Although the mechanisms governing bleaching are unknown, studies implicate uncoupling of coral and algal cell divisions at high temperatures. Still, little is known regarding the coordination of host and algal cell divisions. Control of nutrient exchange is one likely mechanism. Both nitrogen and phosphate are necessary for dividing cells, and although nitrogen enrichment is known to increase symbiont density in the host, the consequences of phosphate enrichment are poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of phosphate depletion on symbiont growth in culture and compared the physiology of phosphate-starved symbionts in culture to symbionts that were freshly isolated from a host. We found that available phosphate is as low in freshly isolated symbionts as it is in phosphate-starved cultures. Furthermore, RNAseq revealed that phosphate-limited and freshly isolated symbionts have similar patterns of gene expression for phosphate-dependent genes, most notably upregulation of phosphatases, which is consistent with phosphate recycling. Similarly, lipid profiling revealed a substantial decrease in phospholipid abundance in both phosphate-starved cultures and freshly isolated symbionts. These findings are important because they suggest that limited access to phosphate controls algal cell divisions within a host.


IMPORTANCE
The corals responsible for building tropical reefs are disappearing at an alarming rate as elevated sea temperatures cause them to bleach and lose the algal symbionts they rely on. Without these symbionts, corals are unable to harvest energy from sunlight and, therefore, struggle to thrive or even survive in the nutrient-poor waters of the tropics. To devise solutions to address the threat to coral reefs, it is necessary to understand the cellular events underpinning the bleaching process. One model for bleaching proposes that heat stress impairs algal photosynthesis and transfer of sugar to the host. Consequently, the host’s demands for nitrogen decrease, increasing nitrogen availability to the symbionts, which leads to an increase in algal proliferation that overwhelms the host. Our work suggests that phosphate may play a similar role to nitrogen in this feedback loop.

 abstract = {Abstract Invasion, metastasis and therapy resistance are the major cause of cancer-associated deaths, and the EMT-inducing transcription factor ZEB1 is a crucial stimulator of these processes. While work on ZEB1 has mainly focused on its role as a transcriptional repressor, it can also act as a transcriptional activator. To further understand these two modes of action, we performed a genome-wide ZEB1 binding study in triple-negative breast cancer cells. We identified ZEB1 as a novel interactor of the AP-1 factors FOSL1 and JUN and show that, together with the Hippo pathway effector YAP, they form a transactivation complex, predominantly activating tumour-promoting genes, thereby synergising with its function as a repressor of epithelial genes. High expression of ZEB1, YAP, FOSL1 and JUN marks the aggressive claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, indicating the translational relevance of our findings. Thus, our results link critical tumour-promoting transcription factors: ZEB1, AP-1 and Hippo pathway factors. Disturbing their molecular interaction may provide a promising treatment option for aggressive cancer types.},

 abstract = {In eukaryotes, members of transcription factor families often exhibit similar DNA binding properties in vitro, yet orchestrate paralog-specific gene regulatory networks in vivo. The serially homologous first (T1) and third (T3) thoracic legs of Drosophila, which are specified by the Hox proteins Scr and Ubx, respectively, offer a unique opportunity to address this paradox in vivo. Genome-wide analyses using epitope-tagged alleles of both Hox loci in the T1 and T3 leg imaginal discs, the precursors to the adult legs and ventral body regions, show that {\textasciitilde}8\% of Hox binding is paralog-specific. Binding specificity is mediated by interactions with distinct cofactors in different domains: the Hox cofactor Exd acts in the proximal domain and is necessary for Scr to bind many of its paralog-specific targets, while in the distal leg domain, the homeodomain protein Distal-less (Dll) enhances Scr binding to a different subset of loci. These findings reveal how Hox paralogs, and perhaps paralogs of other transcription factor families, orchestrate alternative downstream gene regulatory networks with the help of multiple, context-specific cofactors.},

 abstract = {Infertility is linked to different functions of male gametes, one of which is 
caused by impaired motility due to anomalies in sperm flagella. Several genetic 
defects culminate in the loss of fertility when viewed from an evolutionary 
perspective, where sperm flagellar function is extremely conserved across all 
kingdoms. The model moss Physcomitrium patens has genes copies homologous to 
human that are related to the architecture of microtubules that enable sperm motility. 
The moss P. patens has been an important model system for studying issues of 
evolutionary and developmental biology, as well as being an excellent model for 
studies of cellular reprogramming, in addition to collaborating with studies of 
flagellated organisms from various domains of biodiversity. Although the genes 
involved in the process of organogenesis of the reproductive structures of mosses 
are still little explored, it is believed that these may be involved in the construction of 
the motility of the flagellum and other elements of the architecture of the tissues and 
organs involved in evolution. Based on this hypothesis, our objective is to identify the 
genes responsible for the differentiation of reproductive structures and how these 
can identify problems in the formation of Organs reproductive organs of mosses. To 
achieve the objectives, a differential gene expression analysis was carried out with 
the aid of data obtained in the RNA-Seq technique. The reads used were obtained 
from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database, on the 
Sequence Reads Archives (SRA) platform SRR19502729, SRR19502730, 
SRR19502731, SRR19502732, SRR19502733, SRR19502734, SRR4454535 and 
SRR9901085. The raw reads were filtered by size and quality (Phred-Score 28) and 
then analyzed for transcript counts and differential gene expression analysis (DEGs) 
using the Salmon tool. As a result, the genes Pp3c10\_9456v3.1, Pp3c17\_1640V3.1 
and Pp3c17\_13470V3.1 were identified as possible genes involved in the sexual 
differentiation between sexual organs of moss, where these genes are 
over-expressed when there is formation of antheridia and under-expressed when 
there is formation of antheridia. archegoniums. Through the analysis of gene function 
and ontology, it was observed that the Pp3c10\_9456v3.1 gene is responsible for the 
determination of symmetry, morphogenesis of the anatomical structure, assembly of 
cellular components and development of organs in P. patens, being an ideal target 
for tests of gene knockout to validate its role in the differentiation of reproductive 
organs in this plant.},

TcSERPIN has 390 amino acid residues and shows conservation of the main active site, RCL.

The YY1 dimer is shown to bind tandem repeats of a canonical recognition DNA sequence with high affinity, and analysis of human YY1 regulatory sites shows that many contain repeats of its recognition elements. YY1 dimerization may compete with partner protein interactions, making control by zinc ion concentration a previously unrecognized factor affecting YY1 gene regulation.

This translation, however, proves difficult, since while research has investigated the application of these viruses, there are no universally applicable rules in vector design for non-classical adenovirus types. In this paper, we describe a generalized workflow that allows vectorization, rescue, and cloning of all adenoviral species to enable the rapid development of new vector variants.

Here, we report a peptide that mimics the high-affinity BC-box of the PRC2-associated protein EPOP. This peptide tightly binds to the ELOB/C dimer (kD = 0.46 ± 0.02 nM) and blocks the association of ELOB/C with its interaction partners, both in vitro and in the cellular environment. Cancer cells treated with our peptide inhibitor showed decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and perturbed gene expression. Therefore, our work proposes that blocking the BC-box-binding pocket of ELOB/C is a feasible strategy to impair its function and inhibit cancer cell growth. Our peptide inhibitor promises novel mechanistic insights into the biological function of the ELOB/C dimer and offers a starting point for therapeutics linked to ELOB/C dysfunction.},

@article{flores_orozco_evaluation_2024,
 abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) has shown the potential to reduce the abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in animal manures. It stands as a promising option to reduce the risk of the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to livestock production and manure applications. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these changes still need to be fully understood. This multidisciplinary study aimed to utilize metagenomics to investigate the molecular and microbial mechanisms associated with the evolution of ARGs and MGEs during the anaerobic digestion (AD) of bovine dairy manure. The research focused on three main aspects: 1) examining the long-term effects of mesophilic (MAD) and thermophilic (TAD) anaerobic digestion on the entire set of ARGs (resistome) and MGEs (mobilome) in manure; 2) comparing the impact of alternative manure treatments, such as storage and solid-liquid separation, on resistomes and mobilomes; 3) identifying microbial groups potentially associated with ARGs and MGEs and microbial shifts potentially driving changes in resistomes and mobilomes. A meta-analysis conducted early in this research informed the primary focus of this research. Two anaerobic digesters operating at mesophilic (36 °C) and the other at thermophilic (55 °C) temperatures were set up, operated, monitored, and studied for 4 and 2 years, respectively. Metagenomics analyses were used to evaluate resistomes, mobilomes, and microbiomes in the mesophilic and thermophilic digesters operating under steady state and in the bovine manure used as substrate. The results indicated that MAD and TAD lowered ARG levels in fresh cattle manure by over 50\% and MGEs by over 65\%. Surprisingly, TAD did not outperform MAD at reducing ARGs and MGEs. Co-occurrence analysis indicated a strong association between microbial groups from the phyla Bacillota (e.g., Jeotgalicoccus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus), Actinomycetota (e.g., Brevibacterium, Rhodococcus), and Pseudomonadota (e.g., Acinetobacter, Comamonas) with these AMR elements. The decline in the abundance of aerobic and facultative anaerobes likely linked to hydrolytic functions was suggested as one of the main drivers of the changes in resistomes and mobilomes. The proximity of toxin-antitoxin systems and transposon structures to specific ARGs (e.g., Erm, tet, Ant(6)-la) was discovered, which could explain the persistence of such ARGs in digestates. The study of the effects of other manure treatments, such as aerobic storage in an open tank and solid-liquid separation, revealed that they are less efficient in reducing ARGs and MGEs from manures than AD. In this study, the high levels of ARGs and genes conferring resistance to heavy metals in a farm operating in an antibiotic-free environment suggested that other antimicrobials, such as foot bathing solutions, may be causing the indirect selection of ARGs. Overall, this research made several contributions to understanding AMR in the context of anaerobic digestion of animal manure that could be extrapolated to other manure treatments. These contributions not only bridge existing gaps in the literature but also pave the way for future research, providing valuable insights that can be used to inform the development of more effective strategies to mitigate the dissemination of AMR associated with manure management, application, and disposal.},

@article{foll_moving_2021,
 abstract = {Background Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) derives spatial molecular distribution maps directly from clinical tissue specimens. This allows for spatial characterization of molecular compositions of different tissue types and tumor subtypes, which bears great potential for assisting pathologists with diagnostic decisions or personalized treatments. Unfortunately, progress in translational MSI is often hindered by insufficient quality control and lack of reproducible data analysis. Raw data and analysis scripts are rarely publicly shared. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Galaxy MSI tool set for the reproducible analysis of an urothelial carcinoma dataset.
Methods Tryptic peptides were imaged in a cohort of 39 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human urothelial cancer tissue cores with a MALDI-TOF/TOF device. The complete data analysis was performed in a fully transparent and reproducible manner on the European Galaxy Server. Annotations of tumor and stroma were performed by a pathologist and transferred to the MSI data to allow for supervised classifications of tumor vs. stroma tissue areas as well as for muscle-infiltrating and non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas. For putative peptide identifications, m/z features were matched to the MSiMass list.
Results Rigorous quality control in combination with careful pre-processing enabled reduction of m/z shifts and intensity batch effects. High classification accuracy was found for both, tumor vs. stroma and muscle-infiltrating vs. non-muscle invasive tumors. Some of the most discriminative m/z features for each condition could be assigned a putative identity: Stromal tissue was characterized by collagen type I peptides and tumor tissue by histone and heat shock protein beta-1 peptides.Intermediate filaments such as cytokeratins and vimentin were discriminative between the tumors with different muscle-infiltration status. To make the study fully reproducible and to advocate the criteria of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) research data, we share the raw data, spectra annotations as well as all Galaxy histories and workflows. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026459 and Galaxy results via https://github.com/foellmelanie/Bladder\_MSI\_Manuscript\_Galaxy\_links.
Conclusion Here, we show that translational MSI data analysis in a fully transparent and reproducible manner is possible and we would like to encourage the community to join our efforts.},

@article{formenti_gfastats_2022,
 abstract = {With the current pace at which reference genomes are being produced, the availability of tools that can reliably and efficiently generate genome assembly summary statistics has become critical. Additionally, with the emergence of new algorithms and data types, tools that can improve the quality of existing assemblies through automated and manual curation are required.We sought to address both these needs by developing gfastats, as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) effort to generate high-quality reference genomes at scale. Gfastats is a standalone tool to compute assembly summary statistics and manipulate assembly sequences in FASTA, FASTQ or GFA [.gz] format. Gfastats stores assembly sequences internally in a GFA-like format. This feature allows gfastats to seamlessly convert FAST* to and from GFA [.gz] files. Gfastats can also build an assembly graph that can in turn be used to manipulate the underlying sequences following instructions provided by the user, while simultaneously generating key metrics for the new sequences.Gfastats is implemented in C++. Precompiled releases (Linux, MacOS, Windows) and commented source code for gfastats are available under MIT licence at https://github.com/vgl-hub/gfastats. Examples of how to run gfastats are provided in the GitHub. Gfastats is also available in Bioconda, in Galaxy (https://assembly.usegalaxy.eu) and as a MultiQC module (https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC). An automated test workflow is available to ensure consistency of software updates.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Key determinants of successful library preparation are the available amount of input DNA and the efficiency of the conversion of this DNA into functional library molecules. While the standard blunt-end ligation protocol for Ion Torrent libraries has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 25\%, Y-adapters enable highly efficient library preparation by (i) sticky-end ligation and (ii) rendering both DNA strands functional for sequencing, hence resulting in a theoretical efficiency of up to 100\%. Moreover, the generation of adapter dimers is reduced. Therefore, we designed, optimized and validated Y-adapters compatible with Ion Torrent sequencing.

@article{foschini_methylation_2020,
 abstract = {Background: Androgen Receptor (AR) has been described to play a prominent role in Male Breast Cancer (MBC). It maps on chromosome X, and recent reports indicate that X chromosome polysomy is frequent in MBC. Since the response to anti-androgen therapy may depend on AR polysomy and on its overexpression similarly to prostate cancer, aim of the present study was to investigate the DNA methylation level of AR and its coregulators, especially those mapped on the X chromosome, that may influence the activity of AR in MBC. Methods: The DNA methylation level of AR, MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC1, MAGEC2, FLNA, HDAC6, and UXT, mapped on the X chromosome, was evaluated by quantitative Bisulfite-NGS. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in a GalaxyProject environment using BWA-METH, MethylDackel, and Methylation Plotter tools. The study population consisted of MBC (41 cases) compared with gynecomastia (15 cases). Results: MAGEA family members, especially MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC, and UXT and HDAC6 showed hypomethylation of several CpGs, reaching statistical significance by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p{\textless}0.01) in MBC when compared to gynecomastia. AR showed almost no methylation at all. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that MAGEA family members mapped on X chromosome and coregulators of AR, are hypomethylated in male IDC. This may lead to their overexpression, enhancing AR activity, while AR itself shows very little methylation.},

@article{friedrich_tryptophan_2021,
 abstract = {The dynamics and phenotypes of intratumoral myeloid cells during tumor progression are poorly understood. Here we define myeloid cellular states in gliomas by longitudinal single-cell profiling and demonstrate their strict control by the tumor genotype: in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant tumors, differentiation of infiltrating myeloid cells is blocked, resulting in an immature phenotype. In late-stage gliomas, monocyte-derived macrophages drive tolerogenic alignment of the microenvironment, thus preventing T cell response. We define the IDH-dependent tumor education of infiltrating macrophages to be causally related to a complex re-orchestration of tryptophan metabolism, resulting in activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. We further show that the altered metabolism of IDH-mutant gliomas maintains this axis in bystander cells and that pharmacological inhibition of tryptophan metabolism can reverse immunosuppression. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a glioma genotype-dependent intratumoral network of resident and recruited myeloid cells and identify tryptophan metabolism as a target for immunotherapy of IDH-mutant tumors.},

We present a benchmark dataset comprising real-world inter-patient heterogeneity, which we use for in-depth benchmarking of DIA data analysis workflows for clinical settings. Combining spectral libraries, DIA software, sparsity reduction, normalization, and statistical tests results in 1428 distinct data analysis workflows, which we evaluate based on their ability to correctly identify differentially abundant proteins. From our dataset, we derive bootstrap datasets of varying sample sizes and use the whole range of bootstrap datasets to robustly evaluate each workflow. We find that all DIA software suites benefit from using a gas-phase fractionated spectral library, irrespective of the library refinement used. Gas-phase fractionation-based libraries perform best against two out of three reference protein lists. Among all investigated statistical tests non-parametric permutation-based statistical tests consistently perform best.},

Among various known virus-control strategies, RNAi-mediated defence has shown the potential to protect plants against various pathogens including viral infections. Micro(mi)RNAs play a major role in RNAi-mediated defence. Methods Using in silico analyses, we investigated the possibility of tomato-encoded miRNAs (TomiRNA) to target PhCMoV and ToBRFV genomes using five different algorithms, i.e., miRanda, RNAhybrid, RNA22, Tapirhybrid and psRNATarget. Results The results revealed that 14 loci on PhCMoV and 10 loci on ToBRFV can be targeted by the TomiRNAs based on the prediction of at least three algorithms. Interestingly, one TomiRNA, miR6026, can target open reading frames from both viruses, i.e., the phosphoprotein encoding gene of PhCMoV, and the two replicase components of ToBRFV. There are currently no commercially available PhCMoV- or ToBRFV-resistant tomato varieties, therefore the predicted data provide useful information for the development of PhCMoV- and ToBFRV-resistant tomato plants.},

The study aimed to investigate the role of the PGN2012 gene of the periodontitis contributing pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis. PGN2012 is a homolgue of TolC and is a gene our group previously showed was overexpressed in hyperinvasive cells.
Methods
The study used a combination of bioinformatics, knockout mutagenesis, growth experiments, biofilm assays and human cell invation assays to investigate PGN2012 function.
Results
Bioinformatics identified that PGN2012 is part of one of four TolC containing gene loci in P. gingivalis that we predicted may encode a metal resistance RND family tripartite pump, similar to those present in other Gram-negative bacteria, but which are not well understood in anaerobic bacteria. A ΔPGN2012 deletion displayed slightly reduced growth in liquid culture but did not effect biofilm formation or human cell invasion. When metal ions were included in the medium the mutant displayed significantly increased sensitivity to the divalent metal ions Zn2+ (500 μM), Co2+ (2 mM), and Cd2+(0.1 mM) but not Cu2+.
Conclusions
We propose to rename the PGN2012-2014 genes czcCBA, which we suggest plays a role in intracellular stress resistance where zinc is often employed by host cells in antibacterial defence with implications for chronic infection in humans.},

Accordingly, based on the antimicrobial properties of Thyme Essential Oil (TEO), the present study evaluated the effects of TEO on the reduction of common microbial contaminants and Salmonella on poultry litter. A litter bulk sample was collected in a broiler farm and qualitative/quantitative investigations identified Escherichia coli and Mammaliicoccus lentus. The experimental contamination with Salmonella Derby wild strain was also performed. All pathogens showed phenotypic and genotypic resistance to different classes of antibiotics. The litter, split in different units, was treated with aqueous solutions of TEO at different concentrations (5\% to 1.25\%), demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the total number of bacteria. The strongest antibacterial action was observed at the lowest concentration against Enterobacteriaceae, with a growth reduction compared to the positive control of 73.3\% and 77.8\% against E. coli and Salmonella Derby, respectively, while towards M. lentus the reduction was 50\%. Our data confirm the antimicrobial activity of TEO and suggest its possible application for the treatment of poultry litter as an effective and natural approach for the prevention of diseases caused by the most common bacteria that colonize poultry farms, counteracting the onset of antibiotic resistance.},

@article{galvis_dimet_2024,
 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many diseases, such as cancer, are characterized by an alteration of cellular metabolism allowing cells to adapt to changes in the microenvironment. Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics and downstream data analyses are widely used techniques for unraveling cells' metabolic activity to understand the altered functioning of metabolic pathways in the diseased state. While a number of bioinformatic solutions exist for the differential analysis of Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics data, there is currently no available resource providing a comprehensive toolbox.
RESULTS: In this work, we present DIMet, a one-stop comprehensive tool for differential analysis of targeted tracer data. DIMet accepts metabolite total abundances, isotopologue contributions, and isotopic mean enrichment, and supports differential comparison (pairwise and multi-group), time-series analyses, and labeling profile comparison. Moreover, it integrates transcriptomics and targeted metabolomics data through network-based metabolograms. We illustrate the use of DIMet in real SIRM datasets obtained from Glioblastoma P3 cell-line samples. DIMet is open-source, and is readily available for routine downstream analysis of isotope-labeled targeted metabolomics data, as it can be used both in the command line interface or as a complete toolkit in the public Galaxy Europe and Workfow4Metabolomics web platforms.
AVAILABILITY: DIMet is freely available at https://github.com/cbib/DIMet, and through https://usegalaxy.eu and https://workflow4metabolomics.usegalaxy.fr. All the datasets are available at Zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/10925786.

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Mammalian DNA methylation patterns are established by two \textit{de novo} DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which exhibit both redundant and distinctive methylation activities. However, the related molecular basis remains undetermined. Through comprehensive structural, enzymology and cellular characterization of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, we here report a multi-layered substrate-recognition mechanism underpinning their divergent genomic methylation activities. A hydrogen bond in the catalytic loop of DNMT3B causes a lower CpG specificity than DNMT3A, while the interplay of target recognition domain and homodimeric interface fine-tunes the distinct target selection between the two enzymes, with Lysine 777 of DNMT3B acting as a unique sensor of the +1 flanking base. The divergent substrate preference between DNMT3A and DNMT3B provides an explanation for site-specific epigenomic alterations seen in ICF syndrome with DNMT3B mutations. Together, this study reveals crucial and distinctive substrate-readout mechanisms of the two DNMT3 enzymes, implicative of their differential roles during development and pathogenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Awakening of zygotic transcription in animal embryos relies on maternal pioneer transcription factors. The interplay of global and specific functions of these proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed nucleosome positioning, H3K27 acetylation, transcription, and gastrulation rates in zebrafish embryos lacking pluripotency factors Pou5f3 and Sox19b. We show that the bulk transcriptional onset does not require Sox19b and Pou5f3, but is sensitive to their balance. Pou5f3 docks H3K27ac on the enhancers of genes involved in gastrulation and ventral fate specification. Sox19b facilitates Pou5f3 access to one-third of these enhancers. The genes regulating mesendodermal and dorsal fates are primed for activation independently on Pou5f3 and Sox19b. Strikingly, the loss of either factor results in activation of silent enhancers; simultaneous loss of both leads to premature expression of differentiation genes. Our results uncover how independent activities of maternal Pou5f3 and Sox19b add up or antagonize to determine the early gene expression repertoire.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study comprehensively investigates 133 human-origin {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Campylobacter{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} spp. strains (102 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. jejuni{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and 31 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) collected in Italy from 2013 to 2021. The predominant Multilocus Sequence Typing Clonal complexes (CCs) were ST-21 CC and ST-206 CC in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. jejuni{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and ST-828 CC in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Ciprofloxacin and tetracycline resistance, mainly attributed to GyrA (T86I) mutation and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}tet{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}(O) presence, were prevalent, while erythromycin resistance was associated with 23S rRNA gene mutation (A2075G), particularly in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} exhibiting multidrug-resistant pattern CipTE. Notable disparities in virulence factors among strains were observed, with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. jejuni{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} exhibiting a higher abundance compared to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Notably, specific {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. jejuni{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} sequence types, including ST-21, ST-5018, and ST-1263, demonstrated significantly elevated counts of virulence genes. This finding underscores the significance of considering both the species and strain-level variations in virulence factor profiles, shedding light on potential differences in the pathogenicity and clinical outcomes associated with distinct {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C. jejuni{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} lineages. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Campylobacter{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} spp. plasmids were classified into three groups comprising pVir-like and pTet-like plasmids families, exhibiting diversity among {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Campylobacter{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} spp. The study underscores the importance of early detection through Whole Genome Sequencing to identify potential emergent virulence, resistance/virulence plasmids, and new antimicrobial resistance markers.

 abstract = {Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division occurring in sexually reproducing organisms to generate haploid cells known as gametes. In flowering plants, male gametes are produced in anthers, being encased in pollen grains. Understanding the genetic regulation of meiosis key events such as chromosome recognition and pairing, synapsis and recombination, is needed to manipulate chromosome associations for breeding purposes, particularly in important cereal crops like wheat. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyse gene expression and to validate the results obtained by other transcriptomic analyses, like RNA-seq. Selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is essential to obtain reproducible and accurate expression data. In this work, twelve candidate reference genes were evaluated using the mainstream algorithms geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and ΔCt, then ranked from most to least suitable for normalization with RefFinder. Different sets of reference genes were recommended to normalize gene expression data in anther meiosis of bread and durum wheat, their corresponding genotypes in the absence of the Ph1 locus and for comparative studies among wheat genotypes. Comparisons between meiotic (anthers) and somatic (leaves and roots) wheat tissues were also carried out. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first comprehensive list of reference genes for robust RT-qPCR normalization to study differentially expressed genes during male meiosis in wheat in a breeding framework.},

@article{gener_full-coverage_2019,
 abstract = {Objective: To evaluate native RNA sequencing for sequencing HIV-1 viral genomes. Methods: Fifteen HIV-1 strains were processed with Direct RNA Sequencing (SQK-RNA002) library kits and sequenced on MinION Mk1B devices with RevD flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). Raw reads were converted to FASTQ, aligned to reference sequences, and assembled into contigs. Multi-sequence alignments of the contigs were generated and used for cladistics analysis. Results: We sequenced full-length HIV-1 from the transcriptional start site to 39 LTR (100\% virion genome) in 3 out of 15 isolates (89.6, NLAD8, AD17), achieving majority coverage (defined as \&gt; 50\%) in another 7 out of 15 isolates. Inspection of NLAD8 sequence alignments revealed splicing or deletion signatures. Despite the strong 3′ bias, read coverage was sufficient to evaluate single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions in 9 isolates, and to assemble HIV-1 genomes directly from viral RNA, achieving a maximum of 94\% assembly coverage for NLAD8. Phylogenetic relationships were maintained at the level of contigs, as well as individual reads. Conclusions: ONT native RNA sequencing performed as expected, covering full-length HIV-1 RNA without PCR or cDNA sequencing. Native single-molecule RNA sequencing supported previous models of HIV-1 replication, and samples exhibited strain-specific transcriptional signals. We propose Context Dependency Variant Classification to describe variants occurring in information-dense regions of HIV. These data provide a rich resource for emerging RNA modification detection schemes. Future work will expand HIV-1 transcript profiling to infection models and clinical samples.},

@article{genolet_identification_2020,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}X-chromosomal genes contribute to sex differences, in particular during early development, when both X chromosomes are active in females. Here, double X-dosage shifts female pluripotent cells towards the naive stem cell state by increasing pluripotency factor expression, inhibiting the differentiation-promoting MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and delaying differentiation. To identify the genetic basis of these sex differences, we have performed a series of CRISPR knockout screens in murine embryonic stem cells to comprehensively identify X-linked genes that cause the female pluripotency phenotype. We found multiple genes that act in concert, among which Klhl13 plays a central role. We show that this E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor protein promotes pluripotency factor expression, delays differentiation and represses MAPK target genes, and we identify putative substrates. We thus elucidate the mechanisms that drive sex-induced differences in pluripotent cells with implications for gender medicine in the context of induced pluripotent stem cell based therapies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: The study population included 49 consecutive patients treated for OSCC. Oral brushing sample collection was performed at two different times: before any cancer treatment in the tumor mass and during patient follow-up almost 6 months after OSCC treatment, within the regenerative area after OSCC resection. Each sample was considered positive or negative in relation to a predefined cut-off value. Results: Before any cancer treatment, 47/49 specimens exceeded the score and were considered as positive. Six months after OSCC resection, 16/49 specimens also had positive scores in the samples collected from the regenerative area. During the follow-up period, 7/49 patients developed locoregional relapse: 6/7 patients had a positive score in the regenerative area after OSCC resection. The presence of a positive score after oral cancer treatment was the most powerful variable related to the appearance of locoregional relapse. Conclusion: 13-gene DNA methylation analysis by oral brushing may have a clinical application as a prognostic non-invasive tool in the follow-up of patients surgically treated for OSCC.},

In this study, we analyzed a ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI)-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate obtained from a patient previously exposed to CAZ-AVI expressing a novel K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-3 variant. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using reference broth microdilution. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using Illumina and Nanopore Technologies. Short- and long-reads were combined with Unicycler. Assemblies were investigated for multilocus sequence typing (MLST), antimicrobial resistance genes, porins, and plasmids. Results: The K. pneumoniae isolate (KP\_RM\_1) was resistant to CAZ-AVI, expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, amikacin, ertapenem, and cefiderocol (FDC) but was susceptible to tigecycline, colistin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, meropenem–vaborbactam, and imipenem–relebactam. WGS revealed that the KP\_RM\_1 genome is composed of a single chromosome of 5 Mbp and five circular plasmids. Further analysis showed the presence of novel blaKPC-216 located on a 72 kb plasmid. KPC-216 differs from KPC-3 by a Lysin (K) insertion at position 168 (+K168). Conclusions: We report the identification of a new KPC-3 variant associated with CAZ-AVI resistance. The KPC variants associated with CAZ-AVI resistance should be determined to promptly inform clinicians and start the appropriate antimicrobial therapy.},

We observed layer-specific changes in the dendritic complexity and spine density of CA1 pyramidal cells. In addition, transcriptomic analysis highlighted significant changes in the expression of synapse-related genes across development. Finally, we were able to identify significant changes in the expression levels of latrophilin 2, a postsynaptic guidance molecule known for its role in the entorhinal-hippocampal connectivity. These findings were supported by changes in the synaptic proteomic content in CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare.

The application of omics technologies—mainly studying nucleic acids—has significantly improved MB classification and stratification, but treatment options are still unsatisfactory. The proteome and their N-glycans hold the potential to discover clinically relevant phenotypes and targetable pathways. We compile a harmonized proteome dataset of 167 MBs and integrate findings with DNA methylome, transcriptome and N-glycome data. We show six proteome MB subtypes, that can be assigned to two main molecular programs: transcription/translation (pSHHt, pWNT and pG3myc), and synapses/immunological processes (pSHHs, pG3 and pG4). Multiomic analysis reveals different conservation levels of proteome features across MB subtypes at the DNA methylome level. Aggressive pGroup3myc MBs and favorable pWNT MBs are most similar in cluster hierarchies concerning overall proteome patterns but show different protein abundances of the vincristine resistance-associated multiprotein complex TriC/CCT and of N-glycan turnover-associated factors. The N-glycome reflects proteome subtypes and complex-bisecting N-glycans characterize pGroup3myc tumors. Our results shed light on targetable alterations in MB and set a foundation for potential immunotherapies targeting glycan structures.},

 abstract = {Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) is an obligately biotrophic downy mildew that is routinely cultured on Arabidopsis thaliana hosts that harbour complex microbiomes. We hypothesized that the culturing procedure proliferates Hpa-associated microbiota (HAM) in addition to the pathogen and exploited this model system to investigate which microorganisms consistently associate with Hpa. Using amplicon sequencing, we found nine bacterial sequence variants that are shared between at least three out of four Hpa cultures in the Netherlands and Germany and comprise 34\% of the phyllosphere community of the infected plants. Whole-genome sequencing showed that representative HAM bacterial isolates from these distinct Hpa cultures are isogenic and that an additional seven published Hpa metagenomes contain numerous sequences of the HAM. Although we showed that HAM benefit from Hpa infection, HAM negatively affect Hpa spore formation. Moreover, we show that pathogen-infected plants can selectively recruit HAM to both their roots and shoots and form a soil-borne infection-associated microbiome that helps resist the pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms by which infection-associated microbiomes are formed might enable breeding of crop varieties that select for protective microbiomes.},

@article{gosch_spitting_2023,
 abstract = {Forensic trace contextualization, i.e., assessing information beyond who deposited a biological stain, has become an issue of great and steadily growing importance in forensic genetic casework and research. The human transcriptome encodes a wide variety of information and thus has received increasing interest for the identification of biomarkers for different aspects of forensic trace contextualization over the past years. Massively parallel sequencing of reverse-transcribed RNA (“RNA sequencing”) has emerged as the gold standard technology to characterize the transcriptome in its entirety and identify RNA markers showing significant expression differences not only between different forensically relevant body fluids but also within a single body fluid between forensically relevant conditions of interest. Here, we analyze the quality and composition of four RNA sequencing datasets (whole transcriptome as well as miRNA sequencing) from two different research projects (the RNAgE project and the TrACES project), aiming at identifying contextualizing forensic biomarker from the forensically relevant body fluid saliva. We describe and characterize challenges of RNA sequencing of saliva samples arising from the presence of oral bacteria, the heterogeneity of sample composition, and the confounding factor of degradation. Based on these observations, we formulate recommendations that might help to improve RNA biomarker discovery from the challenging but forensically relevant body fluid saliva.},

@article{greenfield_modification_2020,
 abstract = {Dysregulation of epigenetic processes is increasingly understood to play a role in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Ruxolitinib, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, has proved a useful addition to the therapeutic arsenal for these disorders, but has limited disease modifying activity. We determined the effect of JAK inhibition on the histone landscape of MPN cells in cell line models of MPNs and validated using samples from the MAJIC randomised clinical trial of ruxolitinib in polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia. We demonstrated an epigenetic modifying effect of ruxolitinib using a histone modification assay. The majority of 21 histone H3 modifications were upregulated, with H3K27me3 and H3K36me2 significant in the combined cell line results. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CHIP-seq) for three marks of interest, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, was consistent with the histone modification assay showing a significant increase in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks at promoter regions, both marks of active transcription. In contrast, RNA sequencing demonstrates a coordinated reduction in gene expression in a number of cell pathways including PI3K-AKT signalling, transcriptional misregulation in cancer and JAK-STAT signalling in spite of these histone changes. This highlights the complex mechanisms of transcriptional control within the cells which was reflected in analysis of the histone landscape in patient samples following ruxolitinib treatment.},

@article{gress_prostaglandin_2024,
 abstract = {Increased production of Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is linked to development and progression of asthma and allergy. PGD2 is rapidly degraded to its metabolites, which initiate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) migration and IL-5/IL-13 cytokine secretion in a PGD2 receptor 2 (DP2)-dependent manner. Blockade of DP2 has shown therapeutic benefit in subsets of asthma patients. Cellular mechanisms of ILC2 activity in response to PGD2 and its metabolites are still unclear. We hypothesized that ILC2 respond non-uniformly to PGD2 metabolites. ILC2s were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with atopic asthma. ILC2s were stimulated with PGD2 and four PGD2 metabolites (Δ12-PGJ2, Δ12-PGD2, 15-deoxyΔ12,14-PGD2, 9α,11β-PGF2) with or without the selective DP2 antagonist fevipiprant. Total RNA was sequenced, and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified by DeSeq2. Differential gene expression analysis revealed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory DEGs in ILC2s stimulated with PGD2 (14 DEGs), Δ12-PGD2 (27 DEGs), 15-deoxyΔ12,14-PGD2 (56 DEGs) and Δ12-PGJ2 (136 DEGs), but not with 9α,11β-PGF2. Common upregulated DEGs were i.e. ARG2, SLC43A2, LAYN, IGFLR1, or EPHX2. Inhibition of DP2 via fevipiprant mainly resulted in downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as DUSP4, SPRED2, DUSP6, ETV1, ASB2, CD38, ADGRG1, DDIT4, TRPM2, or CD69. DEGs were related to migration and various immune response-relevant pathways such as “chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 production”, “cell migration”, “interleukin-13 production”, “regulation of receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT”, or “lymphocyte apoptotic process”, underlining the pro-inflammatory effects of PGD2 metabolite-induced immune responses in ILC2s as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of DP2 inhibition via fevipiprant. Furthermore, PGD2 and metabolites showed distinct profiles in ILC2 activation. Overall, these results expand our understanding of DP2 initiated ILC2 activity.},

 abstract = {Segmental instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by bronchoscopy safely induces transient airway inflammation in human lungs. This model enables investigation of pulmonary inflammatory mechanisms as well as pharmacodynamic analysis of investigational drugs. The aim of this work was to describe the transcriptomic profile of human segmental LPS challenge with contextualization to major respiratory diseases. Pre-challenge bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and biopsies were sampled from 28 smoking, healthy participants, followed by segmental instillation of LPS and saline as control. Twenty-four hours post instillation, BAL and biopsies were collected from challenged lung segments. Total RNA of cells from BAL and biopsy samples were sequenced and analysed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After challenge with LPS compared with saline, 6316 DEGs were upregulated and 241 were downregulated in BAL, but only one DEG was downregulated in biopsy samples. Upregulated DEGs in BAL were related to molecular functions such as “Inflammatory response” or “chemokine receptor activity”, and upregulated pro-inflammatory pathways such as “Wnt-"/“Ras-"/“JAK-STAT” “-signaling pathway”. Furthermore, the segmental LPS challenge model resembled aspects of the five most prevalent respiratory diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, tuberculosis and lung cancer and featured similarities with acute exacerbations in COPD (AECOPD) and community-acquired pneumonia. Overall, our study provides extensive information about the transcriptomic profile from BAL cells and mucosal biopsies following LPS challenge in healthy smokers. It expands the knowledge about the LPS challenge model providing potential overlap with respiratory diseases in general and infection-triggered respiratory insults such as AECOPD in particular.},

No comparable activity is observed with cytarabine, a cytidine analogue without DNA-hypomethylating properties. As evidence exists for compounding hypermethylation and gene silencing of hemizygous tumor suppressor genes (TSG), we thus hypothesized that this effect may preferentially be reversed by the HMAs decitabine and azacitidine. An unbiased RNA-sequencing approach was developed to interrogate decitabine-induced transcriptome changes in AML cell lines with or without a deletion of chromosomes 7q, 5q or 17p. HMA treatment preferentially upregulated several hemizygous TSG in this genomic region, significantly derepressing endogenous retrovirus (ERV)3–1, with promoter demethylation, enhanced chromatin accessibility, and increased H3K4me3 levels. Decitabine globally reactivated multiple transposable elements, with activation of the dsRNA sensor RIG-I and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7. Induction of ERV3–1 and RIG-I mRNA was also observed during decitabine treatment in vivo in serially sorted peripheral blood AML blasts. In patient-derived monosomal karyotype AML murine xenografts, decitabine treatment resulted in superior survival rates compared with cytarabine. Collectively, these data demonstrate preferential gene derepression and ERV reactivation in AML with chromosomal deletions, providing a mechanistic explanation that supports the clinical observation of superiority of HMA over cytarabine in this difficult-to-treat patient group.
Significance: These findings unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the intriguing clinical activity of HMAs in AML/MDS patients with chromosome 7 deletions and other monosomal karyotypes.See related commentary by O'Hagan et al., p. 813

Using genome-wide single-cell transcriptional profiling of intestinal mononuclear phagocytes and multidimensional flow cytometry, we found that CP- and ILF-associated CD11c+ cells were a transcriptionally distinct subset of intestinal cDCs, which we term CIA-DCs. CIA-DCs required programming by CP- and ILF-resident CCR6+ ILC3 via lymphotoxin-β receptor signaling in cDCs. CIA-DCs differentially expressed genes associated with immunoregulation and were the major cellular source of IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) at steady state. Mice lacking CIA-DC-derived IL-22BP exhibited diminished expression of epithelial lipid transporters, reduced lipid resorption, and changes in body fat homeostasis.

In-silico profiling derived from whole genome sequencing (NCBI accession number: PRJNA780809), was confirmed. This discovery suggested that T. halophilus was part of the human digestive microbiota and that its potential role on human health should be considered.},

 abstract = {Streptococcussuis is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe invasive disease in pigs and humans. Current methods for genome engineering of S. suis rely on the insertion of antibiotic resistance markers, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive and does not allow the precise introduction of small genomic mutations. Here we developed a system for CRISPR-based genome editing in S. suis, utilizing linear DNA fragments for homologous recombination (HR) and a plasmid-based negative selection system for bacteria not edited by HR. To enable the use of this system in other bacteria, we engineered a broad-host-range replicon in the CRISPR plasmid. We demonstrated the utility of this system to rapidly introduce multiple gene deletions in successive rounds of genome editing and to make precise nucleotide changes in essential genes. Furthermore, we characterized a mechanism by which S. suis can escape killing by a targeted Cas9-sgRNA complex in the absence of HR. A characteristic of this new mechanism is the presence of very slow-growing colonies in a persister-like state that may allow for DNA repair or the introduction of mutations, alleviating Cas9 pressure. This does not impact the utility of CRISPR-based genome editing because the escape colonies are easily distinguished from genetically edited clones due to their small colony size. Our CRISPR-based editing system is a valuable addition to the genetic toolbox for engineering of S. suis, as it accelerates the process of mutant construction and simplifies the removal of antibiotic markers between successive rounds of genome editing.},

 abstract = {Mucociliary epithelia provide a first line of defense against pathogens. Impaired regeneration and remodeling of mucociliary epithelia are associated with dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in chronic airway diseases, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and studies yield seemingly contradicting results. Employing the Xenopus mucociliary epidermis, the mouse airway, and human airway Basal cells, we characterize the evolutionarily conserved roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vertebrates. In multiciliated cells, Wnt is required for cilia formation during differentiation. In Basal cells, Wnt prevents specification of epithelial cell types by activating ΔN-TP63, a master transcription factor, which is necessary and sufficient to mediate the Wnt-induced inhibition of specification and is required to retain Basal cells during development. Chronic Wnt activation leads to remodeling and Basal cell hyperplasia, which are reversible in vivo and in vitro, suggesting Wnt inhibition as a treatment option in chronic lung diseases. Our work provides important insights into mucociliary signaling, development, and disease.},

 abstract = {Increased life expectancy in modern society comes at the cost of age-associated disabilities and diseases. Aged brains not only show reduced excitability and plasticity, but also a decline in inhibition. Age-associated defects in inhibitory circuits likely contribute to cognitive decline and age-related disorders. Molecular mechanisms that exert epigenetic control of gene expression contribute to age-associated neuronal impairments. Both DNA methylation, mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and histone modifications maintain neuronal function throughout lifespan. Here we provide evidence that DNMT1 function is implicated in the age-related loss of cortical inhibitory interneurons. Dnmt1 deletion in parvalbumin-positive interneurons attenuates their age-related decline in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, DNMT1-deficient mice show improved somatomotor performance and reduced aging-associated transcriptional changes. A decline in the proteostasis network, responsible for the proper degradation and removal of defective proteins, is implicated in age- and disease- related neurodegeneration. Our data suggest that DNMT1 acts indirectly on interneuron survival in aged mice by modulating the proteostasis network during life-time.},

Additionally, the study aimed to explore the potential exposures related to Cryptosporidium mortiferum (Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype I) infections via interview. Species identification was carried out with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and 18S sequencing. Further typing was performed with gp60 subtyping. Over 70\% of the samples were identified as Cryptosporidium parvum and 20\% as C. mortiferum, which had not been identified in Finland before. Two cases of Cryptosporidium hominis were identified from patients reported to have travelled outside Europe. The C. parvum subtype IIaA15G2R1 and the C. mortiferum subtype XIVaA20G2T1 were the most common subtypes identified. The interviewed C. mortiferum cases did not report shared exposures such as contact with wild rodents. In conclusion, C. parvum and C. mortiferum were the major causes of cryptosporidiosis in the five studied Finnish hospital districts.},

@article{hardtner_comparative_2023,
 abstract = {Background and aims
Atherosclerosis is a systemic and chronic inflammatory disease propagated by monocytes and macrophages. Yet, our knowledge on how transcriptome of these cells evolves in time and space is limited. We aimed at characterizing gene expression changes in site-specific macrophages and in circulating monocytes during the course of atherosclerosis.
Methods
We utilized apolipoprotein E-deficient mice undergoing one- and six-month high cholesterol diet to model early and advanced atherosclerosis. Aortic macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and circulating monocytes from each mouse were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We constructed a comparative directory that profiles lesion- and disease stage-specific transcriptomic regulation of the three cell types in atherosclerosis. Lastly, the regulation of one gene, Gpnmb, whose expression positively correlated with atheroma growth, was validated using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of atheroma plaque from murine and human.
Results
The convergence of gene regulation between the three investigated cell types was surprisingly low. Overall 3245 differentially expressed genes were involved in the biological modulation of aortic macrophages, among which less than 1\% were commonly regulated by the remote monocytes/macrophages. Aortic macrophages regulated gene expression most actively during atheroma initiation. Through complementary interrogation of murine and human scRNA-seq datasets, we showcased the practicality of our directory, using the selected gene, Gpnmb, whose expression in aortic macrophages, and a subset of foamy macrophages in particular, strongly correlated with disease advancement during atherosclerosis initiation and progression.
Conclusions
Our study provides a unique toolset to explore gene regulation of macrophage-related biological processes in and outside the atheromatous plaque at early and advanced disease stages.},

We present an open-source, semi-automated workflow for the in silico prediction of electron ionization high-resolution mass spectra based on the QCxMS software. The workflow was applied to predict the spectra of 367 environmental chemicals and accuracy evaluated by comparison to experimental reference spectra acquired. The molecular flexibility, number of rotatable bonds and number of electronegative atoms of a compound were negatively correlated with prediction accuracy. Few analytes are predicted to sufficient accuracy for the direct application of predicted spectra in spectral matching workflows. The m/z values of the top 5 most abundant ions of predicted spectra rarely match ions in experimental spectra, evidencing the disconnect between simulated fragmentation pathways and empirical reaction mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Self-incompatibility in Prunus species is governed by a single locus consisting of two highly multi-allelic and tightly linked genes, one coding for an F-box protein—i.e., SFB in Prunus- controlling the pollen specificity and one coding for an S-RNase gene controlling the pistil specificity. Genotyping the allelic combination in a fruit tree species is an essential procedure both for cross-based breeding and for establishing pollination requirements. Gel-based PCR techniques using primer pairs designed from conserved regions and spanning polymorphic intronic regions are traditionally used for this task. However, with the great advance of massive sequencing techniques and the lowering of sequencing costs, new genotyping-by-sequencing procedures are emerging. The alignment of resequenced individuals to reference genomes, commonly used for polymorphism detection, yields little or no coverage in the S-locus region due to high polymorphism between different alleles within the same species, and cannot be used for this purpose. Using the available sequences of Japanese plum S-loci concatenated in a rosary-like structure as synthetic reference sequence, we describe a procedure to accurately genotype resequenced individuals that allowed the analysis of the S-genotype in 88 Japanese plum cultivars, 74 of them are reported for the first time. In addition to unraveling two new S-alleles from published reference genomes, we identified at least two S-alleles in 74 cultivars. According to their S-allele composition, they were assigned to 22 incompatibility groups, including nine new incompatibility groups reported here for the first time (XXVII-XXXV).},

Measuring the microbial biocontrol agent (mBCA) populations in the environment is essential for an accurate risk assessment and to optimize the usage of an mBCA-based plant protection product. In this manuscript, a workflow to obtain a large number of qPCR markers suitable for robust strain-specific detection and quantification is presented. The workflow starts from whole genome sequencing data and consists on (i) identifying the strain-specific sequences, (ii) designing specific primer/probe sets for qPCR assays, and (iii) empirically verifying the performance of the assays. The first two stages involve exclusively computer work, but they are intended for researchers with little or no bioinformatic background: only knowledge of the BLAST suite tools and working with spreadsheets are required, and familiarity with the Galaxy environment and next-generation sequencing concepts are strongly advised. All bioinformatic work can be implemented using publically available resources and a regular desktop computer, no matter the operating system, connected to the Internet. The workflow was tested with 5 bacterial strains from different species under development as mBCAs, and yielded thousands of candidate markers and a triplex qPCR assay for each candidate mBCA. The qPCR assays were successfully tested in soils of different nature, water from different sources, and samples from different plant tissues. The mBCA detection limits and population dynamics in the different matrices are similar to those in qPCR assasys designed by other means. In summary a new accessible, amenable, cost-effective and robust, workflow to obtain a large number of strain-specific qPCR markers, is presented.},

 abstract = {We previously found that OsCUL3c is involved in the salt stress response. However, there are no definitive reports on the diversity of OsCUL3c in local Thai rice. In this study, we showed that the CUL3 group was clearly separated from the other CUL groups; next, we focused on OsCUL3c, the third CUL3 of the CUL3 family in rice, which is absent in Arabidopsis. A total of 111 SNPs and 28 indels over the OsCUL3c region, representing 79 haplotypes (haps), were found. Haplotyping revealed that group I (hap A and hap C) and group II (hap B1 and hap D) were different mutated variants, which showed their association with phenotypes under salt stress. These results were supported by cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) analyses. We found that LTR, MYC, [AP2; ERF], and NF-YB, which are related to salt stress, drought stress, and the response to abscisic acid (ABA), have distinct positions and numbers in the haplotypes of group I and group II. An RNA Seq analysis of the two predominant haplotypes from each group showed that the OsCUL3c expression of the group I representative was upregulated and that of group II was downregulated, which was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Promoter changes might affect the transcriptional responses to salt stress, leading to different regulatory mechanisms for the expression of different haplotypes. We speculate that OsCUL3c influences the regulation of salt-related responses, and haplotype variations play a role in this regulation.},

Several organic compounds such as proline, glutamate, sucrose, and 2-aminobutyrate accumulated in salt-treated thalli and might contribute to osmotic potential acclimation, whereas the amount of K+ decreased. We quantified transcript levels for 17,387 genes, of which 95 were up-regulated and 44 down-regulated after salt addition. Genes encoding proteins of the functional groups ion/solute transport and cell wall synthesis/modulation were enriched among the up-regulated genes 24–48 h after salt stress, indicating their role in osmotic acclimation. However, a homolog to land plant ERD4 osmosensors was transiently upregulated after 6 h, and phylogenetic analyses suggested that these sensors evolved in Charophyceae. Down-regulated genes were mainly related to photosynthesis and carbon metabolism/fixation, consistent with the observed lowered growth after extended cultivation. The changed expression of genes encoding proteins for inorganic carbon acquisition might be related to the impact of salt on ionic relations and inorganic carbon uptake. The results indicate that C. braunii can tolerate enhanced salt concentrations in a defined acclimation process, including distinct gene expression changes to achieve new metabolic homeostasis.},

 abstract = {Charophyceae are the most complex streptophyte algae, possessing tissue-like structures, rhizoids and a cellulose-pectin-based cell wall akin to embryophytes. Together with the Zygnematophyceae and the Coleochaetophycae, the Charophyceae form a grade in which the Zygnematophyceae share a last common ancestor with land plants. The availability of genomic data, its short life cycle, and the ease of non-sterile cultivation in the laboratory have made the species Chara braunii an emerging model system for streptophyte terrestrialization and early land plant evolution. In this study, tissue containing nodal cells was prepared under the stereomicroscope, and an RNA-seq dataset was generated and compared to transcriptome data from whole plantlets. In both samples, transcript coverage was high for genes encoding ribosomal proteins and a homolog of the putative PAX3- and PAX7-binding protein 1. Gene ontology was used to classify the putative functions of the differently expressed genes. In the nodal cell sample, main upregulated molecular functions were related to protein, nucleic acid, ATP- and DNA binding. Looking at specific genes, several signaling-related genes and genes encoding sugar-metabolizing enzymes were found to be expressed at a higher level in the nodal cell sample, while photosynthesis-and chloroplast-related genes were expressed at a comparatively lower level. We detected the transcription of 21 different genes encoding DUF4360-containing cysteine-rich proteins. The data contribute to the growing understanding of Charophyceae developmental biology by providing a first insight into the transcriptome composition of Chara nodal cells.},

 abstract = {The adult mammalian heart consists of mononuclear and binuclear cardiomyocytes (CMs) with various ploidies. However, it remains unclear whether a variation in ploidy or number of nuclei is associated with distinct functions and injury responses in CMs, including regeneration. Therefore, we investigated transcriptomes and cellular as well as nuclear features of mononucleated and binucleated CMs in adult mouse hearts with and without injury. To be able to identify the role of ploidy we analyzed control and failing human ventricular CMs because human CMs show a larger and disease-sensitive degree of polyploidization. Using transgenic Myh6-H2BmCh to identify mononucleated and binucleated mouse CMs, we found that cellular volume and RNA content were similar in both. On average nuclei of mononuclear CMs showed a 2-fold higher ploidy, as compared to binuclear CMs indicating that most mononuclear CMs are tetraploid. After myocardial infarction mononucleated and binucleated CMs in the border zone of the lesion responded with hypertrophy and corresponding changes in gene expression, as well as a low level of induction of cell cycle gene expression. Human CMs allowed us to study a wide range of polyploidy spanning from 2n to 16n. Notably, basal as well as pathological gene expression signatures and programs in failing CMs proved to be independent of ploidy. In summary, gene expression profiles were induced in proximity to injury, but independent of number of nuclei or ploidy levels in CMs.},

 abstract = {Balanced signal transduction is crucial in tissue patterning, particularly in the vasculature. Heterotopic ossification (HO) is tightly linked to vascularization with increased vessel number in hereditary forms of HO, such as Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). FOP is caused by mutations in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 leading to aberrant SMAD1/5 signaling in response to ActivinA. Whether observed vascular phenotype in human FOP lesions is connected to aberrant ActivinA signaling is unknown. Blocking of ActivinA prevents HO in FOP mice indicating a central role of the ligand in FOP. Here, we established a new FOP endothelial cell model generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iECs) to study ActivinA signaling. FOP iECs recapitulate pathogenic ActivinA/SMAD1/5 signaling. Whole transcriptome analysis identified ActivinA mediated activation of the BMP/NOTCH pathway exclusively in FOP iECs, which was rescued to WT transcriptional levels by the drug candidate Saracatinib. We propose that ActivinA causes transcriptional pre-patterning of the FOP endothelium, which might contribute to differential vascularity in FOP lesions compared to non-hereditary HO.},

 abstract = {Background Reticulated platelets (RP) are the youngest circulating platelets in blood. An increased amount of this subpopulation is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and mortality. Objectives It is unknown to what extent intrinsic properties of RP contribute to their hyperreactive features. This study is the first providing a multifactorial approach based on ultrastructural, transcriptional, and functional analysis of RP compared to non-RP sorted by flow cytometry. Methods Reticulated platelets and non-RP were sorted after platelet staining with SYTO 13. Employing transmission electron microscopy, 1089 micrographs were analyzed for platelet size, amounts of intracellular structures, and anatomical surrogates indicating activation. Long and small RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for analyzing differential gene expression. Functional analysis of P-selectin—an upregulated mRNA in RP—was performed in healthy subjects and patients on P2Y12-inhibitors. Results Electron micrographs uncovered distinct ultrastructural differences in RP versus non-RP. Cross sections were 1.9-fold larger in RP (P {\textless} .0001). Amounts of α-granules, dense granules, open canalicular system-openings, and mitochondria were increased in RP, which persisted after adjustment for platelet size. Long RNA-seq showed 1212 upregulated transcripts that are predominantly associated to platelet shape change, aggregation, and activation; 1264 mRNAs were downregulated in RP. Small RNA-seq did not reveal any differentially expressed transcripts. Functional analysis displayed higher P-selectin expression as compared to non-RP upon ADP- or TRAP-stimulation. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that altered intrinsic structural and molecular properties contribute to the hyperreactivity of RP. These properties and an increased amount of RP may account for the association with cardiovascular risk.},

Its etiology remains not fully understood, with factors such as allergies, autoimmune responses and genetics playing a role. This study explores the potential of blood microbiome dysbiosis, defined as an imbalance in the microbial ecosystem, as a missing piece of the puzzle in understanding the etiology of the disease. Our objective was to apply a decision-tree supervised machine learning hierarchical model to distinguish potential patterns of microbiome dysbiosis in blood samples from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis as compared to healthy age-matched controls. Blood microbiome analysis, being individually-specific and stable, offers a unique perspective. Utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the blood microbiome composition characterized by non-normally distributed and sparse data. Because of the rarity of the disease in Bulgaria, we studied a relatively small patient group, n = 7. The findings were compared to 21 healthy age-matched controls. Bioinformatics and statistical analysis play a pivotal role in microbiome analysis, especially when discerning associations between taxonomic composition and disorders such as pulmonary sarcoidosis. By analyzing the microbial diversity, we identified alterations in the blood microbiome composition between healthy individuals and those with sarcoidosis, which potentially may trigger the disease. Advanced machine learning techniques provided additional power to the analysis, that might be overlooked by the usual group statistics, confirming the differentiation of the diversity within the studied microbiome.},

 abstract = {Epigenome editing is a promising technology, potentially allowing the stable reprogramming of gene expression profiles without alteration of the DNA sequence. Targeted DNA methylation has been successfully documented by many groups for silencing selected genes, but recent publications have raised concerns regarding its specificity. In the current work, we developed new EpiEditors for programmable DNA methylation in cells with a high efficiency and improved specificity. First, we demonstrated that the catalytically deactivated Cas9 protein (dCas9)-SunTag scaffold, which has been used earlier for signal amplification, can be combined with the DNMT3A-DNMT3L single-chain effector domain, allowing for a strong methylation at the target genomic locus. We demonstrated that off-target activity of this system is mainly due to untargeted freely diffusing DNMT3A-DNMT3L subunits. Therefore, we generated several DNMT3A-DNMT3L variants containing mutations in the DNMT3A part, which reduced their endogenous DNA binding. We analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation of selected variants and confirmed a striking reduction of untargeted methylation, most pronounced for the R887E mutant. For all potential applications of targeted DNA methylation, the efficiency and specificity of the treatment are the key factors. By developing highly active targeted methylation systems with strongly improved specificity, our work contributes to future applications of this approach.},

Various computational techniques, including molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking, density functional theory, and global chemical descriptors, were employed to analyze the interactions between the ligands and target proteins. Docking results indicated that ligands 6, 7, 8, and rifampin exhibited binding affinities of −8.4, −7.4, −9.2, and − 7.2 kcal mol−1, respectively, against mycobacterium tuberculosis enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (INHA), with ligand 8 demonstrating superior inhibition. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were utilized to assess the stability of protein-ligand interactions. Remarkably, the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the INHA-ligand 8 complex remained minimal, with peak values at .40, .56, .37, and .50 nm at temperatures of 300, 305, 310, and 320 K, respectively. This suggests superior stability compared to the reference drug rifampin and INHA complex, which exhibited an RMSD range of .2 to .8 nm at 300 K. Furthermore, analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) revealed that the Egap value of ligand 8 (4.407 eV) is lower than all the reference drugs except rifampin. This comprehensive theoretical analysis positions ligand 8 as a promising candidate for anti-tuberculosis drug development, underscoring the need for further exploration through in vitro and in vivo studies.},

 abstract = {Heat stress in poultry houses, especially in warm areas, is one of the main environmental factors that restrict the growth of broilers or laying performance of layers, suppresses the immune system, and deteriorates egg quality and feed conversion ratio. The molecular mechanisms underlying the response of chicken to acute heat stress (AHS) have not been comprehensively elucidated. Therefore, the main object of the current work was to investigate the liver gene expression profile of chickens under AHS in comparison with their corresponding control groups, using four RNA-seq datasets. The meta-analysis, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, WGCNA, machine-learning, and eGWAS analyses were performed. The results revealed 77 meta-genes that were mainly related to protein biosynthesis, protein folding, and protein transport between cellular organelles. In other words, under AHS, the expression of genes involving in the structure of rough reticulum membrane and in the process of protein folding was adversely influenced. In addition, genes related to biological processes such as “response to unfolded proteins,” “response to reticulum stress” and “ERAD pathway” were differentially regulated. We introduce here a couple of genes such as HSPA5, SSR1, SDF2L1, and SEC23B, as the most significantly differentiated under AHS, which could be used as bio-signatures of AHS. Besides the mentioned genes, the main findings of the current work may shed light to the identification of the effects of AHS on gene expression profiling of domestic chicken as well as the adaptive response of chicken to environmental stresses.},

 abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are functional bridges connecting the genome with phenotypes by interacting with DNA, mRNA, and proteins. Using publically available acute heat stress (AHS)-related RNA-seq data, we discovered novel lncRNAs and tested their association with AHS along with {\textasciitilde} 8800 known lncRNAs and {\textasciitilde} 28,000 mRNA transcripts. Our pipeline discovered a total of 145 potentially novel-lncRNAs. One of them (Fishcomb\_p-value = 0.06) along with another novel transcript (annotated as protein-coding; Fishcomb\_p-value = 0.03) were identified as significantly associated with AHS. We found five  known-lncRNAs and 134 mRNAs transcripts that were significantly associated with AHS. Four novel lncRNAs interact cis-regulated with 12 mRNA transcripts and are targeted by 11 miRNAs. Also six meta-lncRNAs associate with 134 meta-mRNAs through trans-acting co-expression, each targeted by 15 and 216 miRNAs, respectively. Three of the known-lncRNAs significantly co-expressed with almost 97 of the significant mRNAs (Pearson correlation p-value {\textless} 0.05). We report the mentioned three known-lncRNAs (ENSGALT00000099876, ENSGALT00000107573, and ENSGALT00000106323) as the most, significantly regulatory elements of AHS in chicken. It can be concluded that in order to alleviate the adverse effects of AHS on chicken, the manipulation of the three regulatory lncRNAs could lead to a more desirable result than the manipulation of the most significant mRNAs.},

 abstract = {Ethylene plays essential roles in rice growth, development and stress adaptation. Translational control of ethylene signaling remains unclear in rice. Here, through analysis of an ethylene-response mutant mhz9, we identified a glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine (GYF) domain protein MHZ9, which positively regulates ethylene signaling at translational level in rice. MHZ9 is localized in RNA processing bodies. The C-terminal domain of MHZ9 interacts with OsEIN2, a central regulator of rice ethylene signaling, and the N-terminal domain directly binds to the OsEBF1/2 mRNAs for translational inhibition, allowing accumulation of transcription factor OsEIL1 to activate the downstream signaling. RNA-IP seq and CLIP-seq analyses reveal that MHZ9 associates with hundreds of RNAs. Ribo-seq analysis indicates that MHZ9 is required for the regulation of {\textasciitilde} 90\% of genes translationally affected by ethylene. Our study identifies a translational regulator MHZ9, which mediates translational regulation of genes in response to ethylene, facilitating stress adaptation and trait improvement in rice.},

@article{huszarik_external_2023,
 abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used to analyze the diet of arthropods, including spiders. However, high sensitivity to DNA contamination makes it difficult to apply to organisms obtained from mass-sampling methods such as pitfall traps. An alternative is to hand-sample spiders, but it is unclear how effectively this prevents external contamination, especially with new knowledge showing the wide spread of eDNA in the environment. Protocols using bleach to remove external DNA have been tested on several invertebrates, though testing with both mass-sampling methods and spiders is lacking. Here, we used wolf spiders (Lycosidae) to assess the risk of external DNA contamination from pitfall trapping and hand sampling, and the efficacy of bleach decontamination. We first conducted a contamination experiment where we placed spiders in pitfall traps containing trapping medium and a nonprey insect species to simulate external DNA contamination. We also compared sampling methods by collecting spiders using pitfall traps and hand sampling. Spiders from the contamination experiment and sampling method comparison were either bleached or untreated, then metabarcoded using multiple primer pairs. The contamination experiment resulted in the contamination of almost all spiders from pitfall traps, which was successfully eliminated with bleaching. Interestingly, there was no difference in the number of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) detected per spider between pitfall trapping and hand sampling but bleaching resulted in significantly fewer ASV detections for both methods. Additionally, bleaching, but not sampling method, affected the taxonomic diet composition for both hand-sampled and pitfall-trapped spiders, indicating similar levels of external contamination. Our results are the first to confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used together with bleaching for spiders sampled from pitfall traps, and that hand sampling does not necessarily exclude external DNA contamination. Thus, diet studies using metabarcoding should address the risk of external contamination with field-sampled arthropods, regardless of sampling method.},

@article{hwang_reduction_2024,
 abstract = {A hallmark of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is neurobehavioral deficits that still do not have effective treatment. Here, we present that reduction of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is critically involved in neurobehavioral deficits in FASD. We show that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) changes chromatin accessibility of Apoe locus, and causes reduction of APOE levels in both the brain and peripheral blood in postnatal mice. Of note, postnatal administration of an APOE receptor agonist (APOE-RA) mitigates motor learning deficits and anxiety in those mice. Several molecular and electrophysiological properties essential for learning, which are altered by PAE, are restored by APOE-RA. Our human genome-wide association study further reveals that the interaction of PAE and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the APOE enhancer which chromatin is closed by PAE in mice is associated with lower scores in the delayed matching-to-sample task in children. APOE in the plasma is also reduced in PAE children, and the reduced level is associated with their lower cognitive performance. These findings suggest that controlling the APOE level can serve as an effective treatment for neurobehavioral deficits in FASD.},

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) tarafından 2021 yılında yayımlanan raporda gıdalarda kullanılacak bakterilerin tüm genom dizileri üzerinden risk değerlendirmesi yapılması gerekliliği vurgulanmıştır. Bu nedenle, laktik asit bakterilerinde dirençlilik geni araştırmaları önem kazanmıştır. Çünkü antibiyotik direnç genlerinin bağırsak sisteminde bulunan patojen bakterilere aktarılma olasılığı vardır ya da laktik asit bakterilerini barındıran gıdalar aracılığıyla alınmaları olasıdır. Bu nedenle, çalışmada, farklı fermente gıdalardan izole edilen dört laktik asit bakterisi (Lentilactobacillus buchneri Egmn17, Levilactobacillus brevis Atlas17, Levilactobacillus namurensis Ozge01, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Gmze16) ve probiyotik bir bakteri olan Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v suşu kullanılmıştır. Çalışmada, laktik asit bakterileri arasında en yaygın antibiyotik dirençliliği gözlenen tetrasiklin seçilmiştir. 3 bakterinin tetrasiklin antibiyotiğine orta derecede dirençli (zon çapı 15-18 mm) (299v, Gmze16 ve Egmn17) ve 2 bakterinin duyarlı (zon çapı {\textgreater}19 mm) (Atlas17 ve Ozge01) olduğu belirlenmiştir. Laktik asit bakterilerinin tüm genom sekanslarının incelenmesi sonucu, orta dirençli bakterilerin tetrasikline bağlı antimikrobiyal direnç (AMR) genlerinden tetA (MFS dışa atım pompası) ve tetO’ya (ribozomal koruma proteini) sahip oldukları görülmüştür. Levilactobacillus brevis Atlas17’de ise TetA proteini mevcutken 322. aminoasit sekansında M → T değişimi gözlenmiştir. Ayrıca probiyotik bakteri olan Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v’nin direnç genlerine sahip olması bu genlerin bağırsaktaki patojenlere aktarılma riskini de arttırmaktadır. tetA genine sahip olduğu gözlenen Levilactobacillus brevis Atlas17 gibi fenotipi duyarlı olan türler de sessiz dirençlilik genlerine sahip olduklarında bunu diğer bakterilere aktarabilmeleri olasıdır.

 abstract = {The Doñana wetlands comprise an emblematic Mediterranean landscape protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some parts of these wetlands have been transformed into intensive rice cultivation areas, which are currently the most productive rice-growing areas in Europe. We examined the bacterial communities in these domesticated soils as they are key for plant health and productivity and have a strong influence on biochemical cycles. To identify the bacteria, we used metabarcoding analysis coupled with metabolic predictions and co-occurrence networks. This analysis was performed in the bulk and rhizosphere soils during different stages in the growing season. These soil compartments had a greater effect on the bacterial communities than the plant phenological stages. The diversity and richness of the bacterial population inhabiting the rhizosphere was much lower than that in the bulk soil, comprising taxa that were significantly more represented in this soil compartment, such as bacteria from the genus Hydrogenophaga, three genera from the order Rhizobiales, and unclassified genera from the families Desulfocapsaceae and Actinobacteria. Rhizosphere co-occurrence networks revealed a high number of negative connections, indicating unstable bacterial communities that may be highly influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. Rhizosphere networks mostly rely on two taxa belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, which are the predicted network hubs in this soil compartment. The bulk soil conserved high bacterial diversity and richness that was stable throughout the growth period of rice. Anaerobic bacteria from genera Marmoricola, the uncultured Gemmatimonadota bacteria SDR1034 terrestrial group, Anaerolinea, and the sulphur oxidizer, Thiobacillus were highly represented. This analysis provides valuable information for understanding bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of rice cultivated in this region, which is critical for enhancing plant growth and productivity.},

 abstract = {Citrus crops are affected by many fungal diseases. Among them, Citrus Black Spot caused by the ascomycete Phyllosticta citricarpa is particularly economically damaging wherever it occurs. Many other species of Phyllosticta are described on Citrus, but only P. citricarpa is considered a quarantine pest on the European continent. In order to prevent the introduction of this species into Europe, it is essential to have a detection test which can reliably identify it, and not confuse it with other species present on citrus, notably P. paracitricarpa. The latter taxon has recently been described as very close to P. citricarpa, and most detection tests do not allow to distinguish the two species. In this work, we exploited the genomic data of 37 isolates of Phyllosticta spp. from citrus, firstly to assess their phylogenetic relationships, and secondly to search for genomic regions that allowed the definition of species-specific markers of P. citricarpa. Analysis of 51 concatenated genes separated P. citricarpa and P. paracitricarpa in two phylogenetic clades. A locus was selected to define a hydrolysis probe and primers combination that could be used in real-time PCR for the specific detection of the quarantine species, to the exclusion of all others present on Citrus. This test was then thoroughly validated on a set of strains covering a wide geographical diversity, and on numerous biological samples to demonstrate its reliability for regulatory control. The validation data highlighted the need to check the reliability of the test in advance, when a change of reagents was being considered.},

Despite the role of bacteriophages as drivers for microbiome structure and function, there is no information about the structure and function of the gut virome in gnotobiotic models and the link between bacterial and bacteriophage/prophage diversity. We studied the virome of gnotobiotic murine Oligo-MM12 (12 bacterial species) and reduced Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF, three bacterial species). As reference, the virome of Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) mice was investigated. A metagenomic approach was used to assess prophages and bacteriophages in the guts of 6-week-old female mice. We identified a positive correlation between bacteria diversity, and bacteriophages and prophages. Caudoviricetes (82.4\%) were the most prominent class of phages in all samples with differing relative abundance. However, the host specificity of bacteriophages belonging to class Caudoviricetes differed depending on model bacterial diversity. We further studied the role of bacteriophages in horizontal gene transfer and microbial adaptation to the host’s environment. Analysis of mobile genetic elements showed the contribution of bacteriophages to the adaptation of bacterial amino acid metabolism. Overall, our results implicate virome “dark matter” and interactions with the host system as factors for microbial community structure and function which determine host health. Taking the importance of the virome in the microbiome diversity and horizontal gene transfer, reductions in the virome might be an important factor driving losses of microbial biodiversity and the subsequent dysbiosis of the gut microbiome.},

 abstract = {Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (WW) is a promising tool for epidemiological surveillance, correlating not only viral RNA levels with the infection dynamics within the population, but also to viral diversity. However, the complex mixture of viral lineages in WW samples makes tracking of specific variants or lineages circulating in the population a challenging task. We sequenced sewage samples of 9 WW-catchment areas within the city of Rotterdam, used specific signature mutations from individual SARS-CoV-2 lineages to estimate their relative abundances in WW and compared them against those observed in clinical genomic surveillance of infected individuals between September 2020 and December 2021. We showed that especially for dominant lineages, the median of the frequencies of signature mutations coincides with the occurrence of those lineages in Rotterdam's clinical genomic surveillance. This, along with digital droplet RT-PCR targeting signature mutations of specific variants of concern (VOCs), showed that several VOCs emerged, became dominant and were replaced by the next VOC in Rotterdam at different time points during the study. In addition, single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis provided evidence that spatio-temporal clusters can also be discerned from WW samples. We were able to detect specific SNVs in sewage, including one resulting in the Q183H amino acid change in the Spike gene, that was not captured by clinical genomic surveillance. Our results highlight the potential use of WW samples for genomic surveillance, increasing the set of epidemiological tools to monitor SARS-CoV-2 diversity.},

 abstract = {Background The histone methyltransferase DOT1L catalyzes methylation of H3K79 and it is highly conserved in mammals. DOT1L plays a functional role in several biological processes including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, RNA splicing and gene expression, suggesting a complex role in chromatin organization and regulation. Such a remarkable range of functions performed by DOT1L can be the result, at least partially, of its interaction with a plethora of proteins and presence in different complexes.
Results Here, we characterized the cooperation of DOT1L with the nucleolar protein NPM1 and the impact of both proteins on peri-nucleolar heterochromatin activity. We show that i) DOT1L interacts preferentially with monomeric NPM1 in the nucleus; ii) DOT1L acts in concert with NPM1 to maintain each other’s protein homeostasis; iii) NPM1 depletion results in H3K79me2 upregulation at chromatin remodeling genes but does not affect their expression; iv) DOT1L and NPM1 preserved DNA satellite expression at perinucleolar heterochromatin via epigenetic mechanisms dependent on H3K27me3.
Conclusions Our findings give insights into molecular mechanisms employed by DOT1L and NPM1 to regulate heterochromatin activities around the nucleoli and shed light on one aspect of the complex role of both proteins in chromatin dynamics.},

This virus belongs to the Coronavirus family that causes a variety of diseases including head and chest colds, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Metagenomics is the study of genetic material that is recuperated from the environmental samples directly. By examining and elucidating microbial genomes in healthy and infected samples, the metagenomics branch has allowed us to discover the significance of microbial genomes. The metagenomic approach used in the covid-19 infectious disease will serve as a prominent tool for explicating the relationship between host-associated microbial communities and host phenotype. European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) was used to retrieve the metagenome data of the Gut Microbiome of Covid-19 patients with the project id PRJDB12349. For metagenomics analyses, Galaxy server was used identification and classification of microbial communities furhter taxonomic analysis and functional analysis was also performed. Different tools from the galaxy like FastQC, MultiQC, Trim Galore, Megahit, Kraken 2, Convert Kraken, Krona Pie Chart and HUMANn2 were used for complete metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic Analysis shows that there is difference in the percentage and abundance of bacteria in all the covid-19 patients sample. The fungi that were commonly present in all the samples were identified as Eurotiales 78-93\% and Mycospaerellales 7-20\% and the other fungi that were not common but were observed are Dipodasceae 10\% and Sordariales 4-6\%. Further, the gene abundance and the families of the samples were also observed. This study highlights the metagenome of the Covid-19 infectious disease.

Here, we report the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the mAb cocktail REGN-COV in a kidney transplant patient with hypogammaglobulinemia. Following mAb treatment, the patient did not clear the infection. During viral persistence, SARS-CoV-2 acquired three novel spike mutations. Neutralization and mouse protection analyses demonstrate a complete viral escape from REGN-COV at the expense of ACE-2 binding. Final clearance of the virus occurred upon reduction of the immunosuppressive regimen and total IgG substitution. Serology suggests that the development of highly neutralizing IgM rather than IgG substitution aids clearance. Our findings emphasise that selection pressure by mAbs on SARS-CoV-2 can lead to development of escape variants in immunocompromised patients. Thus, modification of immunosuppressive therapy, if possible, might be preferable to control and clearance of the viral infection.},

 abstract = {The current human reference genome, GRCh38, represents over 20 years of effort to generate a high-quality assembly, which has benefitted society1,2. However, it still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological genome as it is a blend of multiple individuals3,4. Recently, a high-quality telomere-to-telomere reference, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a nearly homozygous genome5. To address these limitations, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium formed with the goal of creating high-quality, cost-effective, diploid genome assemblies for a pangenome reference that represents human genetic diversity6. Here, in our first scientific report, we determined which combination of current genome sequencing and assembly approaches yield the most complete and accurate diploid genome assembly with minimal manual curation. Approaches that used highly accurate long reads and parent–child data with graph-based haplotype phasing during assembly outperformed those that did not. Developing a combination of the top-performing methods, we generated our first high-quality diploid reference assembly, containing only approximately four gaps per chromosome on average, with most chromosomes within ±1\% of the length of CHM13. Nearly 48\% of protein-coding genes have non-synonymous amino acid changes between haplotypes, and centromeric regions showed the highest diversity. Our findings serve as a foundation for assembling near-complete diploid human genomes at scale for a pangenome reference to capture global genetic variation from single nucleotides to structural rearrangements.},

 abstract = {The plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae poses a significant threat to global food security, and its management through the cultivation of resistant varieties and crop husbandry practices, including fungicidal sprays, has proven to be inadequate. To address this issue, we conducted small-RNA sequencing to identify the roles of miRNAs and their target genes in both resistant (PB1637) and susceptible (PB1) rice genotypes. We confirmed the expression of differentially expressed miRNAs using stem-loop qRT-PCR analysis and correlated them with rice patho-phenotypic and physio-biochemical responses. Our findings revealed several noteworthy differences between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. The resistant genotype exhibited reduced levels of total chlorophyll and carotenoids compared to the susceptible genotype. However, it showed increased levels of total protein, callose, H2O2, antioxidants, flavonoids, and total polyphenols. Additionally, among the defense-associated enzymes, guaiacol peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase responses were higher in the susceptible genotypes. In our comparative analysis, we identified 27 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated miRNAs in the resistant genotype, while the susceptible genotype exhibited 44 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated miRNAs. Furthermore, we discovered eight up-regulated and five down-regulated miRNAs shared between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. Notably, we also identified six novel miRNAs in the resistant genotype and eight novel miRNAs in the susceptible genotype. These novel miRNAs, namely Chr8\_26996, Chr12\_40110, and Chr12\_41899, were found to negatively correlate with the expression of predicted target genes, including Cyt-P450 monooxygenase, serine carboxypeptidase, and zinc finger A20 domain-containing stress-associated protein, respectively. The results of our study on miRNA and transcriptional responses provide valuable insights for the development of future rice lines that are resistant to blast disease. By understanding the roles of specific miRNAs and their target genes in conferring resistance, we can enhance breeding strategies and improve crop management practices to ensure global food security.},

 abstract = {Therapeutic targets in cancer cells defective for the tumor suppressor ARID1A are fundamentals of synthetic lethal strategies. However, whether modulating ARID1A function in premalignant breast epithelial cells could be exploited to reduce carcinogenic potential remains to be elucidated. In search of chromatin-modulating mechanisms activated by anti-proliferative agents in normal breast epithelial (HME-hTert) cells, we identified a distinct pattern of genome-wide H3K27 histone acetylation marks characteristic for the combined treatment by the cancer preventive rexinoid bexarotene (Bex) and carvedilol (Carv). Among these marks, several enhancers functionally linked to TGF-β signaling were enriched for ARID1A and Brg1, subunits within the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. The recruitment of ARID1A and Brg1 was associated with the suppression of TGFBR2, KLF4, and FoxQ1, and the induction of BMP6, while the inverse pattern ensued upon the knock-down of ARID1A. Bex+Carv treatment resulted in fewer cells expressing N-cadherin and dictated a more epithelial phenotype. However, the silencing of ARID1A expression reversed the ability of Bex and Carv to limit epithelial–mesenchymal transition. The nuclear levels of SMAD4, a canonical mediator of TGF-β action, were more effectively suppressed by the combination than by TGF-β. In contrast, TGF-β treatment exceeded the ability of Bex+Carv to lower nuclear FoxQ1 levels and induced markedly higher E-cadherin positivity, indicating a target-selective antagonism of Bex+Carv to TGF-β action. In summary, the chromatin-wide redistribution of ARID1A by Bex and Carv treatment is instrumental in the suppression of genes mediating TGF-β signaling, and, thus, the morphologic reprogramming of normal breast epithelial cells. The concerted engagement of functionally linked targets using low toxicity clinical agents represents an attractive new approach for cancer interception.},

 abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been frequently reported in companion dogs and cats worldwide during the ongoing coronavirus disease. However, RT-qPCR methods developed for humans have been used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections in suspected companion dogs and cats owing to the lack of the companion animal-tailored methods. Therefore, we developed a multiplex RT-qPCR (mRT-qPCR) using newly designed primers and probes targeting RdRp and N genes of all currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the canine or feline 16S rRNA gene as an endogenous internal positive control (EIPC) for reliable diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from suspected dogs and cats. The developed mRT-qPCR assay specifically detected the target genes of SARS-CoV-2 but no other canine or feline pathogens. Furthermore, canine and feline EIPCs were stably amplified by mRT-qPCR in samples containing canine- or feline-origin cellular materials. This assay has high repeatability and reproducibility, with an optimal limit of detection ({\textless}10 RNA copies per reaction) and coefficients of variation ({\textless}1.0\%). The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 of the developed mRT-qPCR was 6.6\% for canine and feline nasopharyngeal samples, which was consistent with that of a commercial mRT-qPCR kit for humans. Collectively, the newly developed mRT-qPCR with canine and feline EIPC can efficiently diagnose and evaluate the viral load in field specimens and will be a valuable tool for etiological diagnosis, epidemiological study, and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections in canine and feline populations.},

Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of largely host-associated canine and feline genotypes based on infection studies, differences at the 28S rDNA gene, and complete mitochondrial genomes. There have been no comparative genome-wide studies. Here, we sequenced the genomes of a dog and cat isolate of Dipylidium caninum from the United States using the Illumina platform at mean coverage depths of 45× and 26× and conducted comparative analyses with the reference draft genome. Complete mitochondrial genomes were used to confirm the genotypes of the isolates. Genomes of D. caninum canine and feline genotypes generated in this study, had an average identity of 98\% and 89\%, respectively, when compared to the reference genome. SNPs were 20 times higher in the feline isolate. Comparison and species delimitation using universally conserved orthologs and protein-coding mitochondrial genes revealed that the canine and feline isolates are different species. Data from this study build a base for future integrative taxonomy. Further genomic studies from geographically diverse populations are necessary to understand implications for taxonomy, epidemiology, veterinary clinical medicine, and anthelmintic resistance.},

 abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that persists as a global threat to the world. A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4), has emerged as a potential target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity-related disorders. The current study has investigated the FFAR4, deploying 3-dimensional structure modeling, molecular docking, machine learning, and high-throughput virtual screening methods to unravel the receptor’s crucial and non-crucial binding site residues. We screened four lakh compounds and shortlisted them based on binding energy, stereochemical considerations, non-bonded interactions, and pharmacokinetic profiling. Out of the screened compounds, four compounds were selected for ligand-bound simulations. The molecular dynamic simulations were carried out for 1µs for native FFAR4 and 500 ns each for complexes of FFAR4 with compound 1, compound 2, compound 3, and compound 4. Our findings showed that in addition to reported binding site residues ARG99, ARG183, and VAL98 in known agonists like TUG-891, the amino acids ARG22, ARG24, THR23, TRP305, and GLU43 were also critical binding site residues. These amino acids impart stability to the FFAR4 complexes and contribute to the stronger binding affinity of the compounds. The study also indicated that aromatic residues like PHE211 are crucial for recognizing the active site’s pi-pi and C-C double bonds. Since FFAR4 is a membrane protein, the simulation studies give an insight into the mechanisms of the crucial protein-lipid and lipid-water interactions. The analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories showed all four compounds as potential hit molecules that can be developed further into potential agonists for T2DM therapy. Amongst the four compounds, compound 4 showed relatively better binding affinity, stronger non-bonded interactions, and a stable complex. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma},

Currently, whole genome sequencing technology has been widely used to study the phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella, primarily using the Illumina short-read platform. Complete genome sequence data of Salmonella are rarely systematically analyzed in similar studies considering the relatively high cost currently. Therefore, here we collected the complete genome sequence data of 1819 Salmonella in GenBank and classified these strains into different subspecies, serovars, and STs by SISTR, Seqsero2, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and other sophisticated software. In addition, we constructed and demonstrated different phylogenetic trees by four methods with high discriminatory power: core single-nucleotide polymorphism typing, core genome MLST (cgMLST), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat typing, and pan-genome typing. The different typing methods are systematically presented, along with a comparison of the characteristics of the four distinct typing methods used in this chapter. In conclusion, we have made a new attempt to use complete genome sequence datasets to study the phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella. Additional considerations regarding the time required to be consumed, the clustering effect, and the cgMLST method are also discussed.},

Among DYRK class II members, dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) is the functional target for prostate cancer treatment. Studies show that subfamilies of DYRKs are also capable to phosphorylate (tyrosine, serine, and threonine) residues, yet little research has been carried out for its inhibitors. In this article, conceptual density theory is used to estimate the physicochemical properties of 30 experimentally synthesized inhibitors targeting DYRK2. The HOMO–LUMO gap showed low reactivity and high chemical activity for the inhibitors. The biological efficacy of these 30 inhibitors is predicted by bioavailability, mutagenicity, and cardiotoxicity measures. The inhibitors showed low toxicity and no blood brain barrier permeability. Results indicated that the physiological actions of these inhibitors involve multiple target interactions. Since the experimental results of the DYRK2 protein showed great water solubility, favorable safety properties, and potential anti-prostate cancer activities for ligand 24, docking and molecular dynamics simulations from the Galaxy webserver using Gromacs open-source tools are also performed for (DYRK2-24) complex (PDB: 7EJV).

The potential of plant-based diets in the form of functional foods is increasingly being realized as an option to treat and/or prevent several diseases. In this work, we have selected flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum), also known as linseed to study its pharmacological efficacy and proposed mechanisms of action for medicinal purposes.

The binding affinity of flaxseed to three common target proteins family (CCDC28b, PDCD6IP and USP34) is assessed by docking and Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results show that linseed is safe to use for mutagenic toxicity and other cardiotoxicity measures but linseed is unsafe for embryotoxicity, herG toxicity and cardiac failure. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis indicates that flaxseed can be used as a medicinal herb for diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IMD) and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).},

 abstract = {Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can be used as a probiotic or starter culture in dairy, meat, and vegetable fermentation. Therefore, their isolation and identification are essential. Recent advances in omics technologies and high-throughput sequencing have made the identification and characterization of bacteria. This study firstly aimed to demonstrate the sensitivity of the Vitek MS (MALDI-TOF) system in the identification of lactic acid bacteria and, secondly, to characterize bacteria using various bioinformatics approaches. Probiotic potency-related genes and secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters were examined. The Vitek MS (MALDI-TOF) system was able to identify all of the bacteria at the genus level. According to whole genome sequencing, the bacteria were confirmed to be Lentilactobacillus buchneri, Levilactobacillus brevis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Levilactobacillus namurensis. Bacteria had most of the probiotic potency-related genes, and different toxin-antitoxin systems such as PemIK/MazEF, Hig A/B, YdcE/YdcD, YefM/YoeB. Also, some of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, some toxic metabolite-related genes, and antibiotic resistance-related genes were detected. In addition, Lentilactobacillus buchneri Egmn17 had a type II-A CRISPR/Cas system. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Gmze16 had a bacteriocin, plantaricin E/F.},

 abstract = {The switch/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) complex is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller that regulates the spacing of nucleosomes and thereby controls gene expression. Heterozygous mutations in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF complex have been reported in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), with the majority of the mutations in \textit{ARID1B}. CSS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, digital anomalies, and variable intellectual disability. We hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding subunits of the ubiquitously expressed SWI/SNF complex may lead to alterations of the nucleosome profiles in different cell types. We performed the first study on CSS-patient samples and investigated the nucleosome landscapes of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from blood plasma by whole-genome sequencing. In addition, we studied the nucleosome landscapes of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes from CSS-affected individuals by nucleosome occupancy and methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) as well as their expression profiles. In cfDNA of CSS-affected individuals with heterozygous \textit{ARID1B} mutations, we did not observe major changes in the nucleosome profile around transcription start sites. In CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes, we found few genomic regions with different nucleosome occupancy when compared to controls. RNA-seq analysis of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes of these individuals detected only few differentially expressed genes, which were not in proximity to any of the identified differential nucleosome-depleted regions. In conclusion, we show that heterozygous mutations in the human SWI/SNF subunit ARID1B do not have a major impact on the nucleosome landscape or gene expression in blood cells. This might be due to functional redundancy, cell-type specificity, or alternative functions of ARID1B.},

 abstract = {Sorting receptor SORCS2 is a stress-response factor protecting neurons from acute insults, such as during epilepsy. SORCS2 is also expressed in the pancreas, yet its action in this tissue remains unknown. Combining metabolic studies in SORCS2-deficient mice with ex vivo functional analyses and single-cell transcriptomics of pancreatic tissues, we identified a role for SORCS2 in protective stress response in pancreatic islets, essential to sustain insulin release. We show that SORCS2 is predominantly expressed in islet alpha cells. Loss of expression coincides with inability of these cells to produce osteopontin, a secreted factor that facilitates insulin release from stressed beta cells. In line with diminished osteopontin levels, beta cells in SORCS2-deficient islets show gene expression patterns indicative of aggravated cell stress, and exhibit defects in insulin granule maturation and a blunted glucose response. These findings corroborate a function for SORCS2 in protective stress response that extends to metabolism.},

@article{kandinov_azithromycin_2023,
 abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the resistance to macrolides (azithromycin) in the modern Russian population of N. gonorrhoeae with the analysis of genetic resistance determinants. Azithromycin is not used to treat gonococcal infection in Russia. However, among 162 isolates collected in 2020–2021, 22 isolates (13.6\%) were phenotypically resistant to azithromycin. Mutations in 23S rRNA genes were found only in two isolates; erm and mefA genes were absent. Azithromycin resistance was shown to be predominantly associated with mutations in the mtrR and mtrD genes of the MtrCDE efflux pump and their mosaic alleles which may have formed due to a horizontal transfer from N. meningitidis. A total of 30 types of mtrR alleles and 10 types of mtrD alleles were identified including mosaic variants. Matching between the mtrR and mtrD alleles was revealed to indicate the cooperative molecular evolution of these genes. A link between the mtrR and mtrD alleles and NG-MAST types was found only for NG-MAST 228 and 807, typical of N. gonorrhoeae in Russia. The high level of resistance to azithromycin in Russia may be related to the spread of multiple transferable resistance to antimicrobials regardless of their use in the treatment of gonococcal infection.},

@article{kandinov_emergence_2023,
 abstract = {The goal of this work was to determine the factors affecting the emergence of azithromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Russia, where azithromycin was never recommended for the treatment of gonococcal infections. Clinical N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in 2018–2021 (428 isolates) were analyzed. No azithromycin-resistant isolates were found in 2018–2019, but in 2020–2021, a significant increase in the ratio of azithromycin-resistant isolates was observed: 16.8\% and 9.3\%, respectively. A hydrogel DNA microarray was developed for the analysis of resistance determinants: mutations in the genes encoding the mtrCDE efflux system and in all four copies of the 23S rRNA gene (position 2611). A majority of the azithromycin-resistant Russian isolates belonged to the NG-MAST G12302 genogroup, and the resistance was associated with the presence of a mosaic structure of the mtrR gene promoter region with the −35 delA deletion, an Ala86Thr mutation in the mtrR gene, and a mosaic structure of the mtrD gene. A comparative phylogenetic study of modern Russian and European N. gonorrhoeae populations allowed us to conclude that the emergence of azithromycin resistance in Russia in 2020 was the result of the appearance and spread of European N. gonorrhoeae strains belonging to the G12302 genogroup due to possible cross-border transfer.},

@article{kandinov_mini-multilocus_2024,
 abstract = {The increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae necessitates the development of molecular typing schemes that are suitable for rapid and mass screening. The objective of this study was to design and validate a mini-MLST scheme for N. gonorrhoeae based on global pathogen population data. Using sequences of seven housekeeping genes of 21,402 isolates with known MLSTs from the PubMLST database, we identified eighteen informative polymorphisms and obtained mini-MLST nucleotide profiles to predict MLSTs of isolates. We proposed a new MLST grouping system for N. gonorrhoeae based on mini-MLST profiles. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MLST genogroups are a stable characteristic of the N. gonorrhoeae global population. The proposed grouping system has been shown to bring together isolates with similar antimicrobial susceptibility, as demonstrated by the characteristics of major genogroups. Established MLST prediction algorithms based on nucleotide profiles are now publicly available. The mini-MLST scheme was evaluated using a MLST detection/prediction method based on the original hydrogel DNA microarray. The results confirmed a high predictive ability up to the MLST genogroup. The proposed holistic approach to gonococcal population analysis can be used for the continuous surveillance of known and emerging resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates.},

A total of 33 quinolone derivatives were assessed for their physicochemical properties and effectiveness against a range of clinically relevant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Molecular docking studies identified compounds 28, 29, 32, and 33 as having notable binding affinities, particularly against MRSA. Further molecular dynamics simulations of compound 29 confirmed its favorable stability and potential for disrupting MRSA, reinforcing the docking results and showing strong alignment with in vitro findings.

One such Pasteurella like organism, Bisgaard taxon 14 was classified as Spirabiliibacterium mucosae. In the present study, a Gram-negative organism was isolated from ailing pigeons with respiratory infection from a farm in Tamil Nadu, India and the organism was misidentified as Burkholderia mallei by Vitek 2 compact system based on biochemical characterization. Since, B. mallei is highly pathogenic and zoonotic, to further confirm, 16S rDNA sequencing and analysis was carried out which revealed that the strain belonged to Bisgaard taxon 14 (Spirabiliibacterium mucosae). To further confirm the findings, whole genome sequencing of the isolate was performed. Whole genome phylogeny and average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis showed that the genome was closely matching with Spirabiliibacterium mucosae type strain 20,609 /3. Hence, the strain from pigeon was named as Spirabiliibacterium mucosae TN\_CUL\_2021 and the genome was submitted in NCBI SRA database. The genome of S. mucosase TN\_CUL\_2021 is only the second genome available worldwide in the NCBI database. Comparative genome analysis of 26 Pasteurellaceae family strains revealed 1101 genes specific for Spirabiliibacterium mucosae. Similarly, luxS virulence gene was found only in S. mucosae and Bisgaardia hudsonensis strains. Since there are only 2 genomes available in the NCBI genome database, further studies on isolation of S. mucosae needs to be carried out to identify its epidemiology and pathogenesis so as to develop better diagnostic assays and vaccines.},

A comprehensive genome-wide analysis was performed in its genome to understand the role of DDP genes (DUF221) in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). A total of 12 DDP genes were identified and distributed in 8 chromosomes in the common bean genome. The physical and biochemical characteristics of amino acids, motif and intron–exon structure, and cis-regulatory elements of DDP members were determined. Phylogenetically all PvDDPs were clustered into nine clades, subsequently supported by their gene structure and conserved motifs distribution. The PvDDPs contained various cis-acting elements involved in plant responses to abiotic and various phytohormones stresses. A total of 45 different cis-regulatory elements in the putative promoter regions of the PvDDPs were identified. ERE and ABRE were discovered to be present in all PvDDPs, indicating that they may be regulated by ethylene and ABA, both of which are strongly associated with biotic stress response in plant species. Additionally, PvDDPs were targeted by multiple miRNA gene families as well. In this context, the most targeted DDP family members are PvDD10 and PvDDP11. The miRNA target analysis showed that Pvu-miR2594, Pvu-miR169, Pvu-miR2584, Pvu-miR530, Pvu-miR156, and Pvu-miR2592 target these genes. There is a strong correlation between abiotic stress and PvDDPs expression in both leaf and root tissues. PvDDP11 is the unique and highest upregulated gene with hormone treatment and abiotic stress among all the members. Expression of the PvDDP11 gene indicated a strong correlation with drought and salt stress in the common bean roots and leaves, respectively. In conclusion, this study predicted that the putative DDP genes might help improve abiotic and phytohormone tolerance in common bean.},

 abstract = {The Human Genome Annotation (HGA) file is a database where different features describing elements of the genome (genes, transcripts, etc) are stored. HGA is the process of identifying those elements, characterizing them and elucidating their roles. Currently, HGA is still incomplete because it suffers from missed annotation and mis-annotation. Mis-annotation happens when some elements are wrongly annotated or labeled. Missed annotation happens when some elements are absent from the annotation files due to the limitations of analytical and experimental procedures. On one hand, improved identification of novel genome elements is required to help solve the problem of missed annotation. On the other hand, to address the problem of mis-annotation, better classification methods are needed to characterize and validate the novel elements. This thesis addresses the problem of incomplete human genome annotation and proposes an improved identification and validation approach via integration of second and third generation of sequencing. We apply this integrative approach to detect novel mono-exonic genes (MNEGs) and confirm their transcription and translation. Up until recent studies, MNEGs were thought to be artifacts and were discarded. However, our integrative analysis provided additional evidence for the genuine existence of these genes. In the second part of this project, we used computational methods based on a deep learning framework to validate these findings by characterizing MNEG types and classifying them into either proteins coding RNAs (pcRNAs) or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Our results showed that the majority of MNEGs are classified as lncRNAs and further investigation suggested that some of them are circRNAs. Finally, this work provides an innovative approach and a unique computational framework to address the problem of incomplete HGA and could be adopted by the annotators in their pipelines. This study is an important step towards the completion and the improvement of the human genome annotation.},

 abstract = {Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) possess more than twenty carbon atoms and are the major components of seed storage oil, wax, and lipids. FAE (Fatty Acid Elongation) like genes take part in the biosynthesis of VLCFAs, growth regulation, and stress responses, and are further comprised of KCS (Ketoacyl-CoA synthase) and ELO (Elongation Defective Elongase) sub-gene families. The comparative genome-wide analysis and mode of evolution of KCS and ELO gene families have not been investigated in tetraploid Brassica carinata and its diploid progenitors. In this study, 53 KCS genes were identified in B. carinata compared to 32 and 33 KCS genes in B. nigra and B. oleracea respectively, which suggests that polyploidization might has impacted the fatty acid elongation process during Brassica evolution. Polyploidization has also increased the number of ELO genes in B. carinata (17) over its progenitors B. nigra (7) and B. oleracea (6). Based on comparative phylogenetics, KCS, and ELO proteins can be classified into eight and four major groups, respectively. The approximate date of divergence for duplicated KCS and ELO genes varied from 0.03 to 3.20 million years ago (MYA). Gene structure analysis indicated that the maximum number of genes were intron-less and remained conserved during evolution. The neutral type of selection seemed to be predominant in both KCS and ELO genes evolution. String-based protein-protein interaction analysis suggested that bZIP53, a transcription factor might be involved in the activation of transcription of ELO/KCS genes. The presence of biotic and abiotic stress-related cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region suggests that both KCS and ELO genes might also play their role in stress tolerance. The expression analysis of both gene family members reflect their preferential seed-specific expression, especially during the mature embryo development stage. Furthermore, some KCS and ELO genes were found to be specifically expressed under heat stress, phosphorus starvation, and Xanthomonas campestris infection. The current study provides a basis to understand the evolution of both KCS and ELO genes in fatty acid elongation and their role in stress tolerance.},

 abstract = {In this study, genomic and plasmid characteristics of Escherichia coli were determined with the aim of deducing how mcr genes may have spread on a colistin withdrawn pig farm. Whole genome hybrid sequencing was applied to six mcr-positive E. coli (MCRPE) strains isolated from pigs, a farmworker and wastewater collected between 2017 and 2019. Among these, mcr-1.1 genes were identified on IncI2 plasmids from a pig and wastewater, and on IncX4 from the human isolate, whereas mcr-3 genes were found on plasmids IncFII and IncHI2 in two porcine strains. The MCRPE isolates exhibited genotypic and phenotypic multidrug resistance (MDR) traits as well as heavy metal and antiseptic resistance genes. The mcr-1.1-IncI2 and IncX4 plasmids carried only colistin resistance genes. Whereas, the mcr-3.5-IncHI2 plasmid presented MDR region, with several mobile genetic elements. Despite the MCRPE strains belonged to different E. coli lineages, mcr-carrying plasmids with high similarities were found in isolates from pigs and wastewater recovered in different years. This study highlighted that several factors, including the resistomic profile of the host bacteria, co-selection via adjunct antibiotic resistance genes, antiseptics, and/or disinfectants, and plasmid-host fitness adaptation may encourage the maintenance of plasmids carrying mcr genes in E. coli.},

 abstract = {An amino acid exchange (P209L) in the HSPB8 binding site of the human co-chaperone BAG3 gives rise to severe childhood cardiomyopathy. To phenocopy the disease in mice and gain insight into its mechanisms, we generated humanized transgenic mouse models. Expression of human BAG3P209L-eGFP in mice caused Z-disc disintegration and formation of protein aggregates. This was accompanied by massive fibrosis resulting in early-onset restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased mortality as observed in patients. RNA-Seq and proteomics revealed changes in the protein quality control system and increased autophagy in hearts from hBAG3P209L-eGFP mice. The mutation renders hBAG3P209L less soluble in vivo and induces protein aggregation, but does not abrogate hBAG3 binding properties. In conclusion, we report a mouse model mimicking the human disease. Our data suggest that the disease mechanism is due to accumulation of hBAG3P209L and mouse Bag3, causing sequestering of components of the protein quality control system and autophagy machinery leading to sarcomere disruption.},

In the present study we investigated its role in skin regeneration. We found that OLFM4 expression is transiently upregulated in the proliferative phase of cutaneous wound healing in humans as well as in mice. Moreover, a significant increase in OLFM4 expression was detected in the skin of lesional psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that OLFM4 selectively stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and increased both keratinocyte and fibroblast migration. Using proteotranscriptomic pathway analysis we revealed that transcription factors POU5F1/OCT4 and ESR1 acted as hubs for OLFM4-induced signalling in keratinocytes. In vivo experiments utilizing mouse splinted full-thickness cutaneous wound healing model showed that application of recombinant OLFM4 protein can significantly improve wound healing efficacy. Taken together, our results suggest that OLFM4 acts as a transiently upregulated inflammatory signal that promotes wound healing by regulating both dermal and epidermal cell compartments of the skin.},

 abstract = {MCM1-AGAMOUS-DEFICIENS-SRF (MADS)-box transcription factors (TFs) regulate a variety of plant developmental processes, particularly floral organ identity and fruit ripening. However, little is known about the MADS-box TF family in the common fig (Ficus carica L.), a vital fruit crop of Mediterranean countries. Here, we report a comprehensive overview of the MADS-box genes and their TF products in fig, describing their classification, physicochemical properties, protein and gene architectures, phylogenetic relationships, selection mode and differential expression during fruit development. A total of 64 MADS-box members were identified in F. carica and phylogenetically categorized as either type I (30) or type II (34). Type I MADS-box TFs were divided into three families (Mα, Mβ and Mγ, with 16, 4 and 10 members, respectively), whereas type II TFs were classified into two families (MIKCC and MIKC*, with 29 and 5 members, respectively). MIKCC TFs could be further classified into 12 subfamilies. Most FcMADS genes within the same clade were characterized by similar exon–intron organizations and motif compositions. Comparative phylogenetic analysis using mulberry (Morus notabilis) identified 24 (18 type II and 6 type I) orthologs between F. carica and M. notabilis. In addition, 11 paralogous MADS-box gene pairs were identified in F. carica, which evolved under purifying selection, except for two recent paralogs from the TM3 (SOC1) subfamily. RNA-seq results indicated that 28 and 34 FcMADS genes were differentially expressed in fruit peel and female flowers, respectively, during six successive stages of fruit development. According to their expression profiles, genes were grouped into four clusters (I, II, III and IV) in both tissues. FcMADS genes from fruit peel expression cluster IV (FcMADS13, -23, -32, -40 and -60) and female flower expression cluster III (FcMADS9, -49 and -58) were upregulated during fruit ripening in the corresponding tissues, suggesting a potential, tissue-specific role of these candidate genes in fruit ripening. Our findings provide the first genome-wide extended characterization of the MADS-box TF family in F. carica, laying the groundwork for future research on its molecular roles in fruit ripening.},

@article{kocsmar_proteome_2023,
 abstract = {Protein expression is a primary area of interest for routine histological diagnostics and tissue-based research projects, but the limitations of its post-mortem applicability remain largely unclear. On the other hand, tissue specimens obtained during autopsies can provide unique insight into advanced disease states, especially in cancer research. Therefore, we aimed to identify the maximum post-mortem interval (PMI) which is still suitable for characterizing protein expression patterns, to explore organ-specific differences in protein degradation, and to investigate whether certain proteins follow specific degradation kinetics. Therefore, the proteome of human tissue samples obtained during routine autopsies of deceased patients with accurate PMI (6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96 h) and without specific diseases that significantly affect tissue preservation, from lungs, kidneys and livers, was analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). For the kidney and liver, significant protein degradation became apparent at 48 h. For the lung, the proteome composition was rather static for up to 48 h and substantial protein degradation was detected only at 72 h suggesting that degradation kinetics appear to be organ specific. More detailed analyses suggested that proteins with similar post-mortem kinetics are not primarily shared in their biological functions. The overrepresentation of protein families with analogous structural motifs in the kidney indicates that structural features may be a common factor in determining similar postmortem stability. Our study demonstrates that a longer post-mortem period may have a significant impact on proteome composition, but sampling within 24 h may be appropriate, as degradation is within acceptable limits even in organs with faster autolysis.},

 abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled with bottom-up mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics is a versatile technology for identifying and quantifying proteins in complex biological mixtures. Postidentification, analysis of changes in protein abundances between conditions requires increasingly complex and specialized statistical methods. Many of these methods, in particular the family of open-source Bioconductor packages MSstats, are implemented in a coding language such as R. To make the methods in MSstats accessible to users with limited programming and statistical background, we have created MSstatsShiny, an R-Shiny graphical user interface (GUI) integrated with MSstats, MSstatsTMT, and MSstatsPTM. The GUI provides a point and click analysis pipeline applicable to a wide variety of proteomics experimental types, including label-free data-dependent acquisitions (DDAs) or data-independent acquisitions (DIAs), or tandem mass tag (TMT)-based TMT-DDAs, answering questions such as relative changes in the abundance of peptides, proteins, or post-translational modifications (PTMs). To support reproducible research, the application saves user’s selections and builds an R script that programmatically recreates the analysis. MSstatsShiny can be installed locally via Github and Bioconductor, or utilized on the cloud at www.msstatsshiny.com. We illustrate the utility of the platform using two experimental data sets (MassIVE IDs MSV000086623 and MSV000085565).},

 abstract = {Austocystin D is a natural compound that induces cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase-dependent DNA damage and growth inhibition in certain cancer cell lines. Cancer cells exhibiting higher sensitivity to austocystin D often display elevated CYP2J2 expression. However, the essentiality and the role of CYP2J2 for the cytotoxicity of this compound remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CYP2J2 depletion alleviates austocystin D sensitivity and DNA damage induction, while CYP2J2 overexpression enhances them. Moreover, the investigation into genes involved in austocystin D cytotoxicity identified POR and PGRMC1, positive regulators for CYP activity, and KAT7, a histone acetyltransferase. Through genetic manipulation and analysis of multiomics data, we elucidated a role for KAT7 in CYP2J2 transcriptional regulation. These findings strongly suggest that CYP2J2 is crucial for austocystin D metabolism and its subsequent cytotoxic effects. The potential use of austocystin D as a therapeutic prodrug is underscored, particularly in cancers where elevated CYP2J2 expression serves as a biomarker.},

@article{kolosov_malpighian_2019,
 abstract = {Skip to Next Section
The Malpighian tubules (MTs) and hindgut constitute the functional kidney of insects. MTs are outpouchings of the gut and in most insects demonstrate proximodistal heterogeneity in function. In most insects, such heterogeneity is confined to ion/fluid secretion in the distal portion and ion/fluid reabsorption in the proximal portion. In contrast, MTs of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars of butterflies and moths) are composed of five regions that differ in their association with the gut, their structure and ion/fluid transport function. Recent studies have shown that several regions can rapidly and reversibly switch between ion secretion and reabsorption. The present study employed RNAseq, pharmacology and electrophysiology to characterize four distinct regions of the MT in larval Trichoplusia ni. Luminal microelectrode measurements indicate changes in [K+], [Na+] and pH as fluid passes through different regions of the tubule. In addition, the regions examined differ in gene ontology enrichment, and demonstrate robust gradients in expression of ion transporters and endocrine ligand receptors. Lastly, the study provides evidence for direct involvement of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in epithelial ion transport of insect MTs.},

 abstract = {Neurological diseases can lead to the denervation of brain regions caused by demyelination, traumatic injury or cell death. The molecular and structural mechanisms underlying lesion-induced reorganization of denervated brain regions, however, are a matter of ongoing investigation. In order to address this issue, we performed an entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL) in mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures of both sexes and studied denervation-induced plasticity of mossy fiber synapses, which connect dentate granule cells (dGCs) with CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) and play important roles in learning and memory formation. Partial denervation caused a strengthening of excitatory neurotransmission in dGCs, CA3-PCs and their direct synaptic connections, as revealed by paired recordings (dGC-to-CA3-PC). These functional changes were accompanied by ultrastructural reorganization of mossy fiber synapses, which regularly contain the plasticity-regulating protein synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle. We demonstrate that the spine apparatus organelle and synaptopodin are related to ribosomes in close proximity to synaptic sites and reveal a synaptopodin-related transcriptome. Notably, synaptopodin-deficient tissue preparations that lack the spine apparatus organelle failed to express lesion-induced synaptic adjustments. Hence, synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle play a crucial role in regulating lesion-induced synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) programs that train on large datasets require powerful compute infrastructure consisting of several CPU cores and GPUs. JupyterLab provides an excellent framework for developing AI programs, but it needs to be hosted on such an infrastructure to enable faster training of AI programs using parallel computing.
FINDINGS: An open-source, docker-based, and GPU-enabled JupyterLab infrastructure is developed that runs on the public compute infrastructure of Galaxy Europe consisting of thousands of CPU cores, many GPUs, and several petabytes of storage to rapidly prototype and develop end-to-end AI projects. Using a JupyterLab notebook, long-running AI model training programs can also be executed remotely to create trained models, represented in open neural network exchange (ONNX) format, and other output datasets in Galaxy. Other features include Git integration for version control, the option of creating and executing pipelines of notebooks, and multiple dashboards and packages for monitoring compute resources and visualization, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These features make JupyterLab in Galaxy Europe highly suitable for creating and managing AI projects. A recent scientific publication that predicts infected regions in COVID-19 computed tomography scan images is reproduced using various features of JupyterLab on Galaxy Europe. In addition, ColabFold, a faster implementation of AlphaFold2, is accessed in JupyterLab to predict the 3-dimensional structure of protein sequences. JupyterLab is accessible in 2 ways-one as an interactive Galaxy tool and the other by running the underlying Docker container. In both ways, long-running training can be executed on Galaxy's compute infrastructure. Scripts to create the Docker container are available under MIT license at https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gpu-jupyterlab-docker.},

 abstract = {Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) group proteins regulate various developmental processes in plants by repressing target genes via H3K27 trimethylation, and they function antagonistically with H3K4 trimethylation mediated by Trithorax group proteins. Tuberization in potato has been widely studied, but the role of histone modifications in this process is unknown. Recently, we showed that overexpression of StMSI1, a PRC2 member, alters the expression of tuberization genes in potato. As MSI1 lacks histone-modification activity, we hypothesized that this altered expression could be caused by another PRC2 member, StE(z)2, a potential H3K27 methyltransferase in potato. Here, we demonstrate that a short-day photoperiod influences StE(z)2 expression in the leaves and stolons. StE(z)2 overexpression alters plant architecture and reduces tuber yield, whereas its knockdown enhances yield. ChIP-sequencing using stolons induced by short-days indicated that several genes related to tuberization and phytohormones, such as StBEL5/11/29, StSWEET11B, StGA2OX1, and StPIN1 carry H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 marks and/or are StE(z)2 targets. Interestingly, we observed that another important tuberization gene, StSP6A, is targeted by StE(z)2 in leaves and that it has increased deposition of H3K27me3 under long-day (non-induced) conditions compared to short days. Overall, our results show that StE(z)2 and deposition of H3K27me3 and/or H3K4me3 marks might regulate the expression of key tuberization genes in potato.},

 abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled to advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, have facilitated system-wide quantitative profiling of expressed mRNA transcripts and proteins. Proteo-transcriptomic analysis compares the relative abundance levels of transcripts and their corresponding proteins, illuminating discordant gene product responses to perturbations. These results reveal potential post-transcriptional regulation, providing researchers with important new insights into underlying biological and pathological disease mechanisms. To carry out proteo-transcriptomic analysis, researchers require software that statistically determines transcript–protein abundance correlation levels and provides results visualization and interpretation functionality, ideally within a flexible, user-friendly platform. As a solution, we have developed the QuanTP software within the Galaxy platform. The software offers a suite of tools and functionalities critical for proteo-transcriptomics, including statistical algorithms for assessing the correlation between single transcript–protein pairs as well as across two cohorts, outlier identification and clustering, along with a diverse set of results visualizations. It is compatible with analyses of results from single experiment data or from a two-cohort comparison of aggregated replicate experiments. The tool is available in the Galaxy Tool Shed through a cloud-based instance and a Docker container. In all, QuanTP provides an accessible and effective software resource, which should enable new multiomic discoveries from quantitative proteo-transcriptomic data sets.},

 abstract = {Galaxy is a web-based and open-source scientific data-processing platform. Researchers compose pipelines in Galaxy to analyse scientific data. These pipelines, also known as workflows, can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To help researchers with creating workflows, a system is developed to recommend tools that can facilitate further data analysis.A model is developed to recommend tools using a deep learning approach by analysing workflows composed by researchers on the European Galaxy server. The higher-order dependencies in workflows, represented as directed acyclic graphs, are learned by training a gated recurrent units neural network, a variant of a recurrent neural network. In the neural network training, the weights of tools used are derived from their usage frequencies over time and the sequences of tools are uniformly sampled from training data. Hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. Mean accuracy of 98\% in recommending tools is achieved for the top-1 metric.The model is accessed by a Galaxy API to provide researchers with recommended tools in an interactive manner using multiple user interface integrations on the European Galaxy server. High-quality and highly used tools are shown at the top of the recommendations.

@article{kumaran_draft_2020,
 abstract = {In the present study, we report the draft genome of soil isolate DP-K7 that has the potential to degrade methyl red. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome analysis exposed that the bacterial strain DP-K7 belongs to the species Kocuria indica. The genome annotation of the strain DP-K7 through the bioinformatics tool “Prokka” showed that the genome contains 3,010,594 bp with 69.01\% GC content. The genome comprises 57 contigs including 2 rRNA genes, 47 tRNA genes, and 2754 CDS. The plate and broth assay showed that the strain DP-K7 has the potential to utilize methyl red as the sole carbon source for growth. Indeed, the RP-HPLC analysis proved that the strain DP-K7 is capable of degrading methyl red. The genome BLAST against a characterized azoreductase (AzoB—Xenophilus azovorans KF46F) revealed the presence of two azoreductase-like genes (azoKi-1 and azoKi-2). The phylogenetic analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of characterized azoreductases suggested that AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 belong to members of the clade IV azoreductase, which are flavin-independent. The multiple sequence alignment of AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 with flavin-independent azoreductases showed the presence of NAD(P)H binding like motif (GxxGxxG). In addition, other genes coding for dye degrading enzymes (SodC, SodA, KatA, KatE, and DyP2) were also found in the genome supporting that the strain K. indica DP-K7 is a potential azo dye degrader.},

 abstract = {Knowledge of variability in phenological traits is of utmost importance in breeding new almond cultivars in the context of impending climate change. The Northwestern Himalayan region is characterized by extreme winters, and phenological studies of fruit crops in relation to environmental variables in this region are scant. Flowering time being an important trait governing agricultural productivity, the objectives of this study were the evaluation of local and exotic almond cultivars for blooming initiation and other associated parameters. This study also aimed at deciphering the association between bloom dates in almonds and prevailing temperatures. Field phenological observations were performed during seven growing seasons (2012–2018) in Kashmir. Phenological traits like endodormancy breaking were estimated using the correlation model. The heat requirements for blooming were estimated using the growing degree days (GDD) method. The association between average temperatures and days to flowering was studied using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Local cultivars ‘Makhdoom’ and ‘Shalimar’ were earliest to bloom within 80 days, while the exotic cultivars were late bloomers, requiring 87 days. Cultivars ‘Makhdoom’, ‘Shalimar’, ‘Drake’ and ‘Pranyaj’ broke their endodormancy on the same date, i.e. December 26, although another group including ‘Waris’, ‘California Paper Shell’ and ‘Merced’ exhibited endo- to ecodormancy transition on January 21. In general, Himalayan-origin almond cultivars revealed low heat requirements for flowering compared to the exotic ones. PLS regression analysis identified four major periods in which average temperatures successfully explained variation in days to blooming in almonds. In conclusion, a phenological prediction model is presented here that explains variation in blooming dates in almond cultivars as a function of average temperatures. This model addresses the almond cultivars growing in the Himalayan region and is expected to be of great practical utility to the farming community to efficiently plan their orchard management practices.},

Unlike most studied regulatory sRNAs, Yfr1 gene expression only slightly changes under the tested stress conditions and is present at high levels at all times. In contrast, cellular levels of Yfr10 increase during the course of acclimation to darkness, and levels of Yfr2 increase when cells are shifted to high light or nitrogen limitation conditions. In this study, we investigated the targetomes of Yfr2, Yfr1, and Yfr10 in Prochlorococcus MED4, establishing CRAFD-Seq as a new method for identifying direct targets of these sRNAs that is applicable to all bacteria, including those that are not amenable to genetic modification. The results suggest that these sRNAs are integrated within a regulatory network of unprecedented complexity in the adjustment of carbon and nitrogen-related primary metabolism.},

 abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other auxiliary proteins for cell entry. Recent studies have described conjunctival congestion in 0.8\% of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and there has been speculation that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the conjunctiva. However, it is currently unclear whether conjunctival epithelial cells express ACE2 and its cofactors. In this study, a total of 38 conjunctival samples from 38 patients, including 12 healthy conjunctiva, 12 melanoma, 7 squamous cell carcinoma and 7 papilloma samples, were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mRNA expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and its cofactors including TMPRSS2, ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. ACE2 protein expression was assessed in eight healthy conjunctival samples using immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is not substantially expressed in conjunctival samples on the mRNA (median 0.0 transcripts per million (TPM), min 0.0 TPM, max 1.7 TPM) and protein levels. Similar results were obtained for the transcription of other auxiliary molecules. In conclusion, this study finds no evidence for a significant expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary mediators for cell entry in conjunctival samples, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV-2 via these mediators unlikely.

Previously, we reported the existence of these toxins in insects, whose presence is restricted to mosquitoes from the Culicinae subfamily (e.g., Aedes aegypti) and whiteflies from the Aleyrodidae family (e.g., Bemisia tabaci). Both groups of genes are derived from two independent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events and are evolving under purifying selection. Here, we report and characterize the occurrence of a third HGT event in the Sciaroidea superfamily, which supports the recurrent acquisition of RIP genes by insects. Transcriptomic experiments, available in databases, allowed us to describe the temporal and spatial expression profiles for these foreign genes in these organisms. Furthermore, we found that RIP expression is induced after infection with pathogens and provided, for the first time, transcriptomic evidence of parasite SRL depurination. This evidence suggests a possible role of these foreign genes as immune effectors in insects.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE Corneal infections are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. Here we applied high-resolution transcriptomic profiling to assess the general and pathogen-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms during human corneal infection. METHODS Clinical diagnoses of herpes simplex virus (HSV) (n=5) and bacterial/fungal (n=5) keratitis were confirmed by histology. Healthy corneas (n=7) and keratoconus (n=4) samples served as controls. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human corneal specimens were analyzed using the 3' RNA sequencing method Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE RNA-seq). The cellular host response was investigated using comprehensive bioinformatic deconvolution (xCell and CYBERSORTx) analyses and by integration with published single cell RNA-seq data of the human cornea. RESULTS Our analysis identified 216 and 561 genes, that were specifically overexpressed in viral or bacterial/fungal keratitis, respectively, and allowed to distinguish the two etiologies. The virus-specific host response was driven by adaptive immunity and associated molecular signaling pathways, whereas the bacterial/fungal-specific host response mainly involved innate immunity signaling pathways and cell types. We identified several genes and pathways involved in the host response to infectious keratitis, including CXCL9, CXCR3, and MMP9 for viral, and S100A8/A9, MMP9, and the IL17 pathway for bacterial/fungal keratitis. CONCLUSIONS High-resolution molecular profiling provides new insights into the human corneal host response to viral and bacterial/fungal infection. Pathogen-specific molecular profiles may provide the foundation for novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic approaches that target inflammation-induced damage to corneal host cells with the goal to improve the outcome of infectious keratitis.},

@article{larsen_identification_2019,
 abstract = {C-type lectin-like domain containing proteins (CTLDcps) mainly bind carbohydrate-based ligands, but also other ligands. CTLDcps are involved in several biological processes including cell adhesion, cell-cell interactions, and pathogen recognition. Pathogen recognition by myeloid cells, e.g. dendritic cells (DCs), can be facilitated through cell surface expressed CTLDcps. Cell surface expressed CTLDcps have been exploited in vaccine designs for specific targeting of human and mouse DCs using antibodies. In recent years, however, DC targeting using carbohydrate-based vaccines has gained interest due to low production cost, limited immunogenicity, and possibility of multivalent adjustment. In chicken, however, only a few CTLDcps have been identified. Identifying and annotating additional chicken CTLDcps (chCTLDcps) is needed to exploit carbohydrate-mediated DC targeting in chicken. Therefore, we searched the chicken GRCg6a assembly for novel chCTLDcps. We identified 28 chCTLDcps of which 10 had previously been described and also experimentally validated. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR confirmed mRNA expression of the remaining 18 identified chCTLDcps. A group of highly related chCTLDcps, moreover, was shown to be avian-specific and comprise novel members mapped to the proposed chicken natural killer gene complex. Two chCTLDcps, chCLEC17AL-A and chCLEC17AL-B, were found to share a recent common ancestor with CLEC17A. Putative mannose or fucose-binding sequence motifs, EPN and WND, were found in the CTLD of chCLEC17AL-A. Both contained intracellular internalisation and signalling sequence motifs. In conclusion, several chCTLDcps were identified and their expression confirmed. Both chCLEC17AL-A and -B showed promise as potential targets in carbohydrate-based chicken vaccine strategies. Determination of DC-specific expression of chCLEC17AL-A and -B, thus, might prove useful in chicken vaccinology.},

 abstract = {Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and several genetic events have been described to promote the development of thyroid carcinogenesis. Besides the effects of specific mutations on thyroid cancer development, the molecular mechanisms controlling tumorigenesis, tumor behavior, and drug resistance are still largely unknown. Cancer organoids have been proposed as a powerful tool to study aspects related to tumor development and progression and appear promising to test individual responses to therapies. Here, using mESC-derived thyroid organoids, we developed a BrafV637E-inducible model able to recapitulate the features of papillary thyroid cancer in vitro. Overexpression of the murine BrafV637E mutation, equivalent to BrafV600E in humans, rapidly triggers to MAPK activation, cell dedifferentiation, and disruption of follicular organization. BrafV637E-expressing organoids show a transcriptomic signature for p53, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interactions, EMT, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Finally, PTC-like thyroid organoids were used for drug screening assays. The combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors reversed BrafV637E oncogene-promoted cell dedifferentiation while restoring thyroid follicle organization and function in vitro. Our results demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells-derived thyroid cancer organoids can mimic tumor development and features while providing an efficient tool for testing novel targeted therapies.},

 abstract = {Background: Traditional omic analysis relies on p-value and fold change as selection criteria. There is an ongoing debate on their effectiveness in delivering systemic and robust interpretation, due to their dependence on assumptions of conformity with various parametric distributions.Here, we propose a threshold-free selection method based on robust, non-parametric statistics, ensuring independence from the statistical distribution properties and broad applicability. Such methods could adapt to different initial data distributions, contrary to statistical techniques based on fixed thresholds. Methods: Our work extends the Rank Products methodology with a neutral selection method of high information-extraction capacity. We introduce the calculation of the RP distribution\&rsquo;s entropy to isolate the features of interest by their contribution to the distribution\&rsquo;s information content. The aim is a methodology performing threshold-free identification of the differentially expressed features, which are highly informative about the phenomenon under scrutiny. Conclusions: Applying the proposed method on microarray (transcriptomic and DNA methylation) and RNAseq count data of varying sizes and noise presence, we observe robust convergence for the different parameterisations to stable cutoff points. Functional analysis through BioInfoMiner and EnrichR was used to evaluate the information potency of the resulting feature lists. Overall, the derived functional terms provide a systemic description highly compatible with the results of traditional statistical hypothesis testing techniques. The methodology behaves consistently across different data types. The feature lists are compact and information-rich, indicating phenotypic aspects specific to the tissue and biological phenomenon i nvestigated. Selection by information content measures efficiently addresses problems, emerging from arbitrary thresholding, thus facilitating the full automation of the analysis.},

@article{latif_nfatc1_2022,
 abstract = {Objectives Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can persist in the stage of simple hepatic steatosis or progress to steatohepatitis (NASH) with an increased risk for cirrhosis and cancer. We examined the mechanisms controlling the progression to severe NASH in order to develop future treatment strategies for this disease.
Design NFATc1 activation and regulation was examined in livers from patients with NAFLD, cultured and primary hepatocytes and in transgenic mice with differential hepatocyte-specific expression of the transcription factor (Alb-cre, NFATc1c.a. and NFATc1Δ/Δ). Animals were fed with high-fat western diet (WD) alone or in combination with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD treatment. NFATc1-dependent ER stress-responses, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and disease progression were assessed both in vitro and in vivo.
Results NFATc1 expression was weak in healthy livers but strongly induced in advanced NAFLD stages, where it correlates with liver enzyme values as well as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, high-fat WD increased NFATc1 expression, nuclear localisation and activation to promote NAFLD progression, whereas hepatocyte-specific depletion of the transcription factor can prevent mice from disease acceleration. Mechanistically, NFATc1 drives liver cell damage and inflammation through ER stress sensing and activation of the PERK-CHOP unfolded protein response (UPR). Finally, NFATc1-induced disease progression towards NASH can be blocked by TUDCA administration.
Conclusion NFATc1 stimulates NAFLD progression through chronic ER stress sensing and subsequent activation of terminal UPR signalling in hepatocytes. Interfering with ER stress-responses, for example, by TUDCA, protects fatty livers from progression towards manifest NASH.},

 abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signaling molecule that participates in various signaling functions in health and diseases. The tetrameric cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) contributes to H2S biogenesis and several investigations provide evidence on the pharmacological modulation of CSE as a potential target for the treatment of a multitude of conditions. D-penicillamine (D-pen) has recently been reported to selectively impede CSE-catalyzed H2S production but the molecular bases for such inhibitory effect have not been investigated. In this study, we report that D-pen follows a mixed-inhibition mechanism to inhibit both cystathionine (CST) cleavage and H2S biogenesis by human CSE. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying such a mixed inhibition, we performed docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Interestingly, MD analysis of CST binding reveals a likely active site configuration prior to gem-diamine intermediate formation, particularly H-bond formation between the amino group of the substrate and the O3′ of PLP. Similar analyses realized with both CST and D-pen identified three potent interfacial ligand-binding sites for D-pen and offered a rational for D-pen effect. Thus, inhibitor binding not only induces the creation of an entirely new interacting network at the vicinity of the interface between enzyme subunits, but it also exerts long range effects by propagating to the active site. Overall, our study paves the way for the design of new allosteric interfacial inhibitory compounds that will specifically modulate H2S biogenesis by cystathionine γ-lyase.},

@article{leavitt_acute_2024,
 abstract = {Purpose
Tumor hypoxia is a major cause of treatment resistance, especially to radiation therapy at conventional dose rate (CONV), and we wanted to assess whether hypoxia does alter tumor sensitivity to FLASH.
Methods and Materials
We engrafted several tumor types (glioblastoma [GBM], head and neck cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma) subcutaneously in mice to provide a reliable and rigorous way to modulate oxygen supply via vascular clamping or carbogen breathing. We irradiated tumors using a single 20-Gy fraction at either CONV or FLASH, measured oxygen tension, monitored tumor growth, and sampled tumors for bulk RNAseq and pimonidazole analysis. Next, we inhibited glycolysis with trametinib in GBM tumors to enhance FLASH efficacy.
Results
Using various subcutaneous tumor models, and in contrast to CONV, FLASH retained antitumor efficacy under acute hypoxia. These findings show that in addition to normal tissue sparing, FLASH could overcome hypoxia-mediated tumor resistance. Follow-up molecular analysis using RNAseq profiling uncovered a FLASH-specific profile in human GBM that involved cell-cycle arrest, decreased ribosomal biogenesis, and a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Glycolysis inhibition by trametinib enhanced FLASH efficacy in both normal and clamped conditions.
Conclusions
These data provide new and specific insights showing the efficacy of FLASH in a radiation-resistant context, proving an additional benefit of FLASH over CONV.},

Variants of concern (VOCs) declared by the World Health Organization require continuous monitoring because of their possible changes in transmissibility, virulence, and antigenicity. The Omicron variant, a VOC, has become the dominant variant worldwide since November 2021. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly after the detection of Omicron VOC on November 24, 2021. In this study, we estimated the underlying epidemiological processes of Omicron VOC in South Korea using time-scaled phylodynamic analysis. Three distinct phylogenetic subgroups (Kor-O1, Kor-O2, and Kor-O3) were detected in South Korea. The Kor-O1 subgroup circulated in the Daegu region, whereas Kor-O2 and Kor-O3 circulated in Incheon and Jeollanam-do, respectively. The viral population size and case number of the Kor-O1 subgroup increased more rapidly than those of the other subgroups, indicating the rapid spread of the virus. The results indicated the multiple introductions of Omicron sub-lineages into South Korea and their subsequent co-circulation. The evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be continuously monitored, and control strategies need to be improved to control the multiple variants.},

CdaH is a Fused or Stk36 kinase ortholog that localizes to multiple sites that correlate with the effects of its loss, including the division boundary and the new oral apparatus. CdaH acts downstream of CdaA to induce the division boundary and drives asymmetric cytokinesis at the tip of the posterior daughter. CdaH both maintains the anterior–posterior position of the new oral apparatus and interacts with CdaI to pattern ciliary rows within the oral apparatus. Thus, CdaH acts at multiple scales, from induction and positioning of structures on the cell-wide polarity axis to local organelle-level patterning.},

@article{lengfelder_complex_2019,
 abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with compositional and functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, but specific contributions of individual bacteria to chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear. Enterococcus faecalis is a resident member of the human intestinal core microbiota that has been linked to the pathogenesis of IBD and induces chronic colitis in susceptible monoassociated IL-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of E. faecalis as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of E. faecalis isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10-/- mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the ethanolamine utilization (eut) locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of eut genes, deletion of ethanolamine utilization (∆eutVW) had no impact on E. faecalis colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10-/- mice. However, replacement of the E. faecalis wild type bacteria by a ∆eutVW mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10-/- mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of E. faecalis ethanolamine utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand E. faecalis gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type E. faecalis cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10-/- mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms E. faecalis gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in E. faecalis monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of E. faecalis genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking E. faecalis enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that E. faecalis ethanolamine metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis towards a protective function.},

@article{lenz_amyloid_2023,
 abstract = {The perforant path provides the primary cortical excitatory input to the hippocampus. Because of its important role in information processing and coding, entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus have been studied in considerable detail. Nevertheless, synaptic transmission between individual connected pairs of entorhinal stellate cells and dentate granule cells remains to be characterized. Here, we have used mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures of either sex, in which the entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate granule cell (GC; EC–GC) projection is present, and EC–GC pairs can be studied using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. By using cultures of wild-type mice, the properties of EC–GC synapses formed by afferents from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex were compared, and differences in short-term plasticity were identified. As the perforant path is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease, we used tissue cultures of amyloid precursor protein (APP)–deficient mice to examine the role of APP at this synapse. APP deficiency altered excitatory neurotransmission at medial perforant path synapses, which was accompanied by transcriptomic and ultrastructural changes. Moreover, presynaptic but not postsynaptic APP deletion through the local injection of Cre-expressing adeno-associated viruses in conditional APPflox/flox tissue cultures increased the neurotransmission efficacy at perforant path synapses. In summary, these data suggest a physiological role for presynaptic APP at medial perforant path synapses that may be adversely affected under altered APP processing conditions.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The hippocampus receives input from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. These projections to hippocampal dentate granule cells are of utmost importance for learning and memory formation. Although there is detailed knowledge about perforant path projections, the functional synaptic properties at the level of individual connected pairs of neurons are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of APP in mediating functional properties and transmission rules in individually connected neurons using paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and genetic tools in organotypic tissue cultures. Our results show that presynaptic APP expression limits excitatory neurotransmission via the perforant path, which could be compromised in pathologic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.},

 abstract = {Podocyte maintenance and stress resistance are exquisitely based on high basal rates of autophagy making these cells a unique model to unravel mechanisms of autophagy regulation. Polyamines have key cellular functions such as proliferation, nucleic acid biosynthesis and autophagy. Here we test whether endogenous spermidine signaling is a driver of basal and dynamic autophagy in podocytes by using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interfere with different steps of polyamine metabolism. Translational studies revealed altered spermidine signaling in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in vivo and in vitro. Exogenous spermidine supplementation emerged as new treatment strategy by successfully activating autophagy in vivo via inhibition of EP300, a protein with an essential role in controlling cell growth, cell division and prompting cells to differentiate to take on specialized functions. Surprisingly, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy based untargeted metabolomics of wild type and autophagy deficient primary podocytes revealed a positive feed-back mechanism whereby autophagy itself maintains polyamine metabolism and spermidine synthesis. The transcription factor MAFB acted as an upstream regulator of polyamine metabolism. Thus, our data highlight a novel positive feedback loop of autophagy and spermidine signaling allowing maintenance of high basal levels of autophagy as a key mechanism to sustain the filtration barrier. Hence, spermidine supplementation may emerge as a new therapeutic to restore autophagy in glomerular disease.},

Furthermore, we use strain TP1 to select for increased resistance to five of the phages in vitro, and identify mutations that are also found in phage-insensitive isolates TP2 and TP3 (which evolved in vivo during phage treatment). These results support that in vitro investigations can produce results that are relevant to the in vivo environment.},

Technological advances in chromatin conformation capture (3C) assays make it possible to identify chromatin loops in the genome. However, a variety of experimental protocols have resulted in different levels of biases, which require distinct methods to call true loops from the background. Although many bioinformatics tools have been developed to address this problem, there is still a lack of special introduction to loop-calling algorithms. This review provides an overview of the loop-calling tools for various 3C-based techniques. We first discuss the background biases produced by different experimental techniques and the denoising algorithms. Then, the completeness and priority of each tool are categorized and summarized according to the data source of application. The summary of these works can help researchers select the most appropriate method to call loops and further perform downstream analysis. In addition, this survey is also useful for bioinformatics scientists aiming to develop new loop-calling algorithms.},

In addition, the prebiotic effect throughput sequencing remains poorly investigated since most of the published works used qPCR or FISH to estimate bacterial changes. In this work, an in vitro model of the human distal colon was used to determine, for the first time, the potential prebiotic effect of a brown whole seaweed Himanthalia elongata. The whole seaweed was characterized in basis of its nutritional and mineral composition and submitted to the entire gastrointestinal digestion. The prebiotic effect was evaluated by the microbial modulation through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR and short-chain fatty acid analysis. The obtained results indicated that the colonic fraction of H. elongata was used selectively by the Bacteroides genus, more specifically by the specie Bacteoides ovatus, whereas inulin was used mainly by the Parabacteroides genus, being Parabacteroides distasonis the most abundant identified specie. Selective use of inulin by P. distasonis is, therefore, reported by the first time. qPCR analysis shown no significative differences in Bifidobacterium population and a decrease in Lactobacillus along the fermentation assays with both substrates. Regarding to the short-fatty acid production, maximal concentration, 56.11 ± 20.48 mM, was achieved for H. elongata, at 24 h of fermentation whereas for inulin total acid production was 93.66 ± 21.82 mM at 48 h of assay. The metabolic pathways associated with bacterial genera were not significantly different between the two tested substrates. Although more studies are necessary to elucidate the prebiotic character of H. elongata, the results presented in this work are promissory and could open new opportunities of research and application in the area of Nutrition and Food Chemistry.},

Here, we wanted to assess the heritability of heat stress-induced epigenetic and transcriptomic changes following woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) reproduction. Strawberry is an ideal model to study epigenetic inheritance because it presents two modes of reproduction: sexual (self-pollinated plants) and asexual (clonally propagated plants named daughter plants). Taking advantage of this model, we investigated whether heat stress-induced DNA methylation changes can be transmitted via asexual reproduction.},

We generated multi-omics profiles and constructed a high-resolution map of 3D genome architecture of rhesus macaque during corticogenesis. By comparing the 3D genomes of human, macaque, and mouse brains, we identified many human-specific chromatin structure changes, including 499 topologically associating domains (TADs) and 1,266 chromatin loops. The human-specific loops are significantly enriched in enhancer-enhancer interactions, and the regulated genes show human-specific expression changes in the subplate, a transient zone of the developing brain critical for neural circuit formation and plasticity. Notably, many human-specific sequence changes are located in the human-specific TAD boundaries and loop anchors, which may generate new transcription factor binding sites and chromatin structures in human. Collectively, the presented data highlight the value of comparative 3D genome analyses in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of brain development and evolution.},

Six Sst encoding genes (sst1 to sst6) have been identified in teleost fish genomes but little is known about their function. The present study aimed at replicating the context of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and clarifying the involvement of sst3 in the intestine innate defence barrier in zebrafish larvae. We first established a CRISP/Cas9 sst3 deficient line (MT) and analysed the morphological and transcriptomic response to 0.4\% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Alcian blue staining of larval sections 6 days post fertilization showed an increased in acidic mucins in the intestinal bulb and mid-intestine, with a much stronger response in the MT compared to wild type (WT). The transcriptomic analysis revealed that WT and MT shared enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways linked to catabolism, chondrocyte development, innate immune system, xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress. In contrast, the WT specific response to DSS was enriched in GO terms and pathways linked to transcription and translation, various developmental processes, regulation of biosynthetic processes, apelin signalling and apoptosis while the MT specific response included terms and pathways linked to protein metabolism and catabolic processes, extracellular matrix – receptor interaction and proteasome and chondrocyte development. Overall, this study demonstrated that Sst3 deficiency impairs insulin growth factor and adipocytokine signalling exacerbating the inflammatory response to DSS.},

Although data generation capacity is well established and sufficiently standardized, analytical capacity is not. To establish analytical capacity it is necessary to pull together global computational resources and deliver the best open source tools and analysis workflows within a ready to use, universally accessible resource. Such a resource should not be controlled by a single research group, institution, or country. Instead it should be maintained by a community of users and developers who ensure that the system remains operational and populated with current tools. A community is also essential for facilitating the types of discourse needed to establish best analytical practices. Bringing together public computational research infrastructure from the USA, Europe, and Australia, we developed a distributed data analysis platform that accomplishes these goals. It is immediately accessible to anyone in the world and is designed for the analysis of rapidly growing collections of deep sequencing datasets. We demonstrate its utility by detecting allelic variants in high-quality existing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing datasets and by continuous reanalysis of COG-UK data.

 abstract = {Campylobacter ureolyticus is an emerging pathogen increasingly appreciated as a common cause of gastroenteritis and extra-intestinal infections in humans. Outside the setting of gastroenteritis, little work has been done to describe the genomic content and relatedness of the species, especially regarding clinical isolates. We reviewed the epidemiology of clinical C. ureolyticus cultured by our institution over the past 10 years. Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization suggested that these C. ureolyticus comprised a species complex of 10 species clusters (SCs) and several subspecies clusters. Although some orthologous genes or gene functions were enriched in isolates found in different SCs and clinical specimens, no association was significant. Nearly a third of the isolates possessed antimicrobial resistance genes, including the ermA resistance gene, potentially conferring resistance to macrolides, the treatment of choice for severe human campylobacteriosis. This work effectively doubles the number of publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes, provides further clarification of taxonomic relationships within this bacterial complex, and identifies target SCs for future analysis.},

 abstract = {Contractile vacuoles (CVs), enigmatic osmoregulatory organelles, share common characteristics, such as a requirement for RAB11 and high levels of V-ATPase. These commonalities suggest a conserved evolutionary origin for the CVs with implications for understanding of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and eukaryotic diversification more broadly. A taxonomically broader sampling of CV-associated machinery is required to address this question further. We used a transcriptomics-based approach to identify CV-associated gene products in Dictyostelium discoideum. This approach was first validated by assessing a set of known CV-associated gene products, which were significantly upregulated following hypo-osmotic exposure. Moreover, endosomal and vacuolar gene products were enriched in the upregulated gene set. An upregulated SNARE protein (NPSNB) was predominantly plasma membrane localised and enriched in the vicinity of CVs, supporting the association with this organelle found in the transcriptomic analysis. We therefore confirm that transcriptomic approaches can identify known and novel players in CV function, in our case emphasizing the role of endosomal vesicle fusion machinery in the D. discoideum CV and facilitating future work to address questions regarding the deep evolution of eukaryotic organelles.},

@article{marco_dorq-seq_2024,
 abstract = {Due to its high modification content tRNAs are notoriously hard to quantify by reverse transcription and RNAseq. Bypassing numerous biases resulting from concatenation of enzymatic treatments, we here report a hybrid approach that harnesses the advantages of hybridization-based and deep sequencing–based approaches. The method renders obsolete any RNAseq related workarounds and correction factors that affect accuracy, sensitivity, and turnaround time. Rather than by reverse transcription, quantitative information on the isoacceptor composition of a tRNA pool is transferred to a cDNA mixture in a single step procedure, thereby omitting all enzymatic conversations except for the subsequent barcoding PCR. As a result, a detailed tRNA composition matrix can be obtained from femtomolar amounts of total tRNA. The method is fast, low in cost, and its bioinformatic data workup surprisingly simple. These properties make the approach amenable to high-throughput investigations including clinical samples, as we have demonstrated by application to a collection of variegated biological questions, each answered with novel findings. These include tRNA pool quantification of polysome-bound tRNA, of tRNA modification knockout strains under stress conditions, and of Alzheimer patients’ brain tissues.},

The assembled transcriptome comprised 37,117 protein-coding transcripts, of which 13,633 full-length ({\textgreater}80\% coverage), with an Ex90N50 of 3061 bp and 76\% of complete and single-copy core vertebrate genes orthologues. Of these transcripts, 34,980 had a hit against the EggNOG database and 14,983 with the KEGG database. Codon usage bias was identified in processes such as translation and muscle development. By comparing our data with a set of representative fish species, 87.1\% of tuna transcripts were included in orthogroups with other species and 5.1\% in assembly-specific orthogroups, which were enriched in terms related to muscle and bone development, visual system and ion transport. Following this comparative approach, protein families related to myosin, extracellular matrix and immune system resulted significantly expanded in the Atlantic bluefin tuna. Altogether, these results provide a glimpse of how the Atlantic bluefin tuna might have achieved early physical advantages over competing species in the pelagic environment. The information generated lays the foundation for future research on the more detailed exploration of physiological responses at the molecular level in different larval stages and paves the way to evolutionary studies on the Atlantic bluefin tuna.},

Here, using interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we perform detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human CD4+ T helper 1 (Th-1) cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We identify CDK8 as a negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities, which interacts with STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecule inhibitors, reduces the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23\% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 S727 phosphorylation. STAT3 binding to target DNA sites in the genome is increased upon CDK8 inhibition, which results in a concomitant increase in STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions results in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity by modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to diversification of IL-6 responses.},

 abstract = {LAMA2, coding for the laminin-α2 chain, is a crucial ECM component, particularly abundant in skeletal muscle. Mutations in LAMA2 trigger the often-lethal LAMA2-congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD). Various phenotypes have been linked to LAMA2-CMD; nevertheless, the precise mechanisms that malfunction during disease onset in utero remain unknown. We generated Lama2-deficient C2C12 cells and found that Lama2-deficient myoblasts display proliferation, differentiation, and fusion defects, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, fetal myoblasts isolated from the dyW mouse model of LAMA2-CMD display impaired differentiation and fusion in vitro. We also showed that disease onset during fetal development is characterized by a significant down-regulation of gene expression in muscle fibers, causing pronounced effects on cytoskeletal organization, muscle differentiation, and altered DNA repair and oxidative stress responses. Together, our findings provide unique insights into the critical importance of the laminin-α2 chain for muscle differentiation and muscle cell homeostasis.

 abstract = {The predator Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) represents one of the major threats to honeybee survival. Viral spillover from bee to wasp has been supposed in several studies, and this work aims to identify and study the virome of both insect species living simultaneously in the same foraging area. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on V. velutina and Apis mellifera samples, and replicative form of detected viruses was carried out by strand-specific RT-PCR. Overall, 6 and 9 different viral types were reported in V. velutina and A. mellifera, respectively, and five of these viruses were recorded in both hosts. Varroa destructor virus-1 and Cripavirus NB-1/2011/HUN (now classified as Triato-like virus) were the most represented viruses detected in both hosts, also in replicative form. In this investigation, Triato-like virus, as well as Aphis gossypii virus and Nora virus, was detected for the first time in honeybees. Concerning V. velutina, we report for the first time the recently detected honeybee La Jolla virus. A general high homology rate between genomes of shared viruses between V. velutina and A. mellifera suggests the efficient transmission of the virus from bee to wasp. In conclusion, our findings highlight the presence of several known and newly reported RNA viruses infecting A. mellifera and V. velutina. This confirms the environment role as an important source of infection and indicates the possibility of spillover from prey to predator.},

@article{mathlouthi_colorectal_2023,
 abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious public health problem known to have a multifactorial etiology. The association between gut microbiota and CRC has been widely studied; however, the link between archaea and CRC has not been sufficiently studied. To investigate the involvement of archaea in colorectal carcinogenesis, we performed a metagenomic analysis of 68 formalin-embedded paraffin fixed tissues from tumoral (n = 33) and healthy mucosa (n = 35) collected from 35 CRC Tunisian patients. We used two DNA extraction methods: Generead DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and Chelex. We then sequenced the samples using Illumina Miseq. Interestingly, DNA extraction exclusively using Chelex generated enough DNA for sequencing of all samples. After data filtering and processing, we reported the presence of archaeal sequences, which represented 0.33\% of all the reads generated. In terms of abundance, we highlighted a depletion in methanogens and an enrichment in Halobacteria in the tumor tissues, while the correlation analysis revealed a significant association between the Halobacteria and the tumor mucosa (p {\textless} 0.05). We reported a strong correlation between Natrialba magadii, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and tumor tissues, and a weak correlation between Methanococcus voltae and healthy adjacent mucosa. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of archaeome analysis from formol fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues using simple protocols ranging from sampling to data analysis, and reported a significant association between Halobacteria and tumor tissues in Tunisian patients with CRC. The importance of our study is that it represents the first metagenomic analysis of Tunisian CRC patients’ gut microbiome, which consists of sequencing DNA extracted from paired tumor-adjacent FFPE tissues collected from CRC patients. The detection of archaeal sequences in our samples confirms the feasibility of carrying out an archaeome analysis from FFPE tissues using a simple DNA extraction protocol. Our analysis revealed the enrichment of Halobacteria, especially Natrialba magadii, in tumor mucosa compared to the normal mucosa in CRC Tunisian patients. Other species were also associated with CRC, including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Methanococcus voltae, which is a methanogenic archaea; both species were found to be correlated with adjacent healthy tissues.},

 abstract = {Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in plants is essential to several aspects of plant development, such as tolerance to environmental stresses and growth. ABA signaling is also important for storage organ formation in crops, such as sweet potato. However, the repertoire of I. batatas ABA signaling gene families has not yet been fully characterized, so that it is unclear which members of these families are necessary for tuberization. Therefore, genome-wide identification of the sweet potato ABF/ AREB/ ABI5, SnRK2, and PYL gene families was performed, along with phylogenetic, motif, cis-regulatory element (CRE), and expression analyses. Nine ABF, eight SnRK2, and eleven PYL gene family members were identified, and there was high sequence conservation among these proteins that were revealed by phylogenetic and motif analyses. The promoter sequences of these genes had multiple CREs that were involved in hormone responses and stress responses. In silico and qRT-PCR expression analyses revealed that these genes were expressed in various tissues and that IbABF3, IbABF4, IbDPBF3, IbDPBF4, IbPYL4, IbSnRK2.1, and IbSnRK2.2 were significantly expressed during storage root development. These results are an important reference that can be used for functional validation studies to better understand how ABA signaling elicits storage root formation at the molecular level.},

 abstract = {Auxin is a plant phytohormone that is essential for the initiation of tuberization in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.). Auxin exerts these effects via polar auxin transport facilitated by various auxin influx and efflux carriers. It is unclear which members of the auxin transporter families: PIN, PILS, Aux/LAX, and ABCB, are involved in sweet potato tuber initiation and development. Therefore, a genome-wide analysis of the I. batatas auxin transporter genes was conducted, and their expression patterns during storage root initiation and development were analyzed. Five IbLAX, 16 IbPIN, 12 IbPILS, and 34 IbABCB family members were identified. These genes showed high conservation among families based on their intron-exon structure, motif composition, and phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, the promoter regions of these genes had various cis-acting regulatory elements involved in hormone, light, and developmental responses. The auxin transporter genes were expressed in various sweet potato tissues, and many were differentially expressed during storage root development. IbLAX1, IbPIN13, IbPILS7, IbABCB1, and IbABCB14 showed up-regulated expression during tuber initiation. This study characterizes these auxin transporter gene families for the first time. These results are an important reference for validation studies to determine the specific functions of these genes and their auxin transporting capability.},

 abstract = {Stomatopod crustaceans have among the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom, with up to 12 different color detection channels. The capabilities of these unique eyes include photoreception of ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (\&lt;400 nm). UV vision has been well characterized in adult stomatopods but has not been previously demonstrated in the comparatively simpler larval eye. Larval stomatopod eyes are developmentally distinct from their adult counterpart and have been described as lacking the visual pigment diversity and morphological specializations found in adult eyes. However, recent studies have provided evidence that larval stomatopod eyes are more complex than previously thought and warrant closer investigation. Using electroretinogram recordings in live animals we found physiological evidence of blue- and UV-sensitive photoreceptors in larvae of the Caribbean stomatopod species Neogonodactylus oerstedii. Transcriptomes of individual larvae were used to identify the expression of three distinct UV opsin mRNA transcripts, which may indicate the presence of multiple UV spectral channels. This is the first paper to document UV vision in any larval stomatopod, expanding our understanding of the importance of UV sensitivity in plankton. Larval stomatopod eyes are more complex and more similar to adult eyes than expected, showing previously uncharacterized molecular diversity and physiological functions.},

Our analysis revealed epigenetic heterogeneity was a key characteristic of IPF AMs. DNAm ‘clock’ analysis indicated epigenetic alterations in IPF-AMs was not associated with accelerated ageing. In differential DNAm analysis, we identified numerous differentially methylated positions (DMPs, n=11) and regions (DMRs, n=49) between healthy and IPF AMs respectively. DMPs and DMRs encompassed genes involved in lipid (\textit{LPCAT1}) and glucose (\textit{PFKB3}) metabolism and importantly, DNAm status was associated with disease severity in IPF. Collectively, our data identify that profound changes in the epigenome underpin the development and function of AMs in the IPF lung.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To identify genetic influences on VSMC behavior, we measured these traits and undertook genome-wide association studies in primary umbilical artery-derived VSMCs from {\textgreater}2000 individuals. Although there were no genome-wide significant associations for VSMC proliferation or migration, genetic variants at two genomic loci (7p15.3 and 7q32.3) showed highly significant associations with VSMC apoptosis (P = 1.95 × 10−13 and P = 7.47 × 10−9, respectively). The lead variant at the 7p51.3 locus was associated with increased expression of the GSDME and PALS2 genes in VSMCs. Knockdown of GSDME or PALS2 in VSMCs attenuated apoptotic cell death. A protein co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that GSDME complexed with PALS2. PALS2 knockdown attenuated activated caspase-3 and GSDME fragmentation, whilst GSDME knockdown also reduced activated caspase-3. These findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of VSMC apoptosis, with potential utility for therapeutic development.},

The complex of the 3E0M-ligand 11 remained highly stable across all tested temperatures (300, 305, 310, and 320 K). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to evaluate the behavior of the complex at various temperatures (300, 305, 310, and 320 K), demonstrating a total variance of 85\%. Convergence was confirmed by the eigenvector’s cosine content value of 0.43, consistently displaying low RMSD values, with the minimum observed at 310 K. Furthermore, ligand 11 emerges as the most promising candidate among the compounds examined, showcasing notable potential when considering a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and now in silico data. While the naphthoquinone derivative (11) remains the primary candidate based on comprehensive in silico studies, further analysis using Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) suggests while the Egap value of compound 11 (2.980 eV) and compound 13 (2.975 eV) is lower than ofloxacin (4.369 eV), indicating their potential, so it can be a statement that compound 13 can also be investigated in further research.},

 abstract = {The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aided in understanding the role of microbial communities and the influence of collective genetic material (the ‘microbiome’) in human health and disease. With the evolution of new sequencing technologies, researchers can now investigate the microbiome and map its influence on human health. Advances in bioinformatics methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis have helped researchers to gain an in-depth knowledge about the taxonomic and genetic composition of microbial communities. Metagenomic-based methods have been the most commonly used approaches for microbiome analysis; however, it primarily extracts information about taxonomic composition and genetic potential of the microbiome under study, lacking quantification of the gene products (RNA and proteins). Conversely, metatranscriptomics, the study of a microbial community’s RNA expression, can reveal the dynamic gene expression of individual microbial populations and the community as a whole, ultimately providing information about the active pathways in the microbiome.  In order to address the analysis of NGS data, the ASaiM analysis framework was previously developed and made available via the Galaxy platform. Although developed for both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, the original publication demonstrated the use of ASaiM only for metagenomics, while thorough testing for metatranscriptomics data was lacking.  In the current study, we have focused on validating and optimizing the tools within ASaiM for metatranscriptomics data. As a result, we deliver a robust workflow that will enable researchers to understand dynamic functional response of the microbiome in a wide variety of metatranscriptomics studies. This improved and optimized ASaiM-metatranscriptomics (ASaiM-MT) workflow is publicly available via the ASaiM framework, documented and supported with training material so that users can interrogate and characterize metatranscriptomic data, as part of larger meta-omic studies of microbiomes.},

 abstract = {The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in a major health crisis worldwide with its continuously emerging new strains, resulting in new viral variants that drive "waves" of infection. PCR or antigen detection assays have been routinely used to detect clinical infections; however, the emergence of these newer strains has presented challenges in detection. One of the alternatives has been to detect and characterize variant-specific peptide sequences from viral proteins using mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods. MS methods can potentially help in both diagnostics and vaccine development by understanding the dynamic changes in the viral proteome associated with specific strains and infection waves. In this study, we developed an accessible, flexible, and shareable bioinformatics workflow that was implemented in the Galaxy Platform to detect variant-specific peptide sequences from MS data derived from the clinical samples. We demonstrated the utility of the workflow by characterizing published clinical data from across the world during various pandemic waves. Our analysis identified six SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific peptides suitable for confident detection by MS in commonly collected clinical samples.},

 abstract = {For mass spectrometry-based peptide and protein quantification, label-free quantification (LFQ) based on precursor mass peak (MS1) intensities is considered reliable due to its dynamic range, reproducibility, and accuracy. LFQ enables peptide-level quantitation, which is useful in proteomics (analyzing peptides carrying post-translational modifications) and multi-omics studies such as metaproteomics (analyzing taxon-specific microbial peptides) and proteogenomics (analyzing non-canonical sequences). Bioinformatics workflows accessible via the Galaxy platform have proven useful for analysis of such complex multi-omic studies. However, workflows within the Galaxy platform have lacked well-tested LFQ tools. In this study, we have evaluated moFF and FlashLFQ, two open-source LFQ tools, and implemented them within the Galaxy platform to offer access and use via established workflows. Through rigorous testing and communication with the tool developers, we have optimized the performance of each tool. Software features evaluated include: (a) match-between-runs (MBR); (b) using multiple file-formats as input for improved quantification; (c) use of containers and/or conda packages; (d) parameters needed for analyzing large datasets; and (e) optimization and validation of software performance. This work establishes a process for software implementation, optimization, and validation, and offers access to two robust software tools for LFQ-based analysis within the Galaxy platform.},

@article{mehta_updates_2021,
 abstract = {metaQuantome is a software suite that enables the quantitative analysis, statistical evaluation. and visualization of mass-spectrometry-based metaproteomics data. In the latest update of this software, we have provided several extensions, including a step-by-step training guide, the ability to perform statistical analysis on samples from multiple conditions, and a comparative analysis of metatranscriptomics data. The training module, accessed via the Galaxy Training Network, will help users to use the suite effectively both for functional as well as for taxonomic analysis. We extend the ability of metaQuantome to now perform multi-data-point quantitative and statistical analyses so that studies with measurements across multiple conditions, such as time-course studies, can be analyzed. With an eye on the multiomics analysis of microbial communities, we have also initiated the use of metaQuantome statistical and visualization tools on outputs from metatranscriptomics data, which complements the metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses already available. For this, we have developed a tool named MT2MQ (“metatranscriptomics to metaQuantome”), which takes in outputs from the ASaiM metatranscriptomics workflow and transforms them so that the data can be used as an input for comparative statistical analysis and visualization via metaQuantome. We believe that these improvements to metaQuantome will facilitate the use of the software for quantitative metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics and will enable multipoint data analysis. These improvements will take us a step toward integrative multiomic microbiome analysis so as to understand dynamic taxonomic and functional responses of these complex systems in a variety of biological contexts. The updated metaQuantome and MT2MQ are open-source software and are available via the Galaxy Toolshed and GitHub.},

@article{meier_antileukemic_2022,
 abstract = {The prognosis of AML patients with adverse genetics, such as a complex, monosomal karyotype and TP53 lesions, is still dismal even with standard chemotherapy. DNA-hypomethylating agent monotherapy induces an encouraging response rate in these patients. When combined with decitabine (DAC), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) resulted in an improved response rate and longer overall survival in a randomized phase II trial (DECIDER; NCT00867672). The molecular mechanisms governing this in vivo synergism are unclear. We now demonstrate cooperative antileukemic effects of DAC and ATRA on AML cell lines U937 and MOLM-13. By RNA-sequencing, derepression of {\textgreater}1200 commonly regulated transcripts following the dual treatment was observed. Overall chromatin accessibility (interrogated by ATAC-seq) and, in particular, at motifs of retinoic acid response elements were affected by both single-agent DAC and ATRA, and enhanced by the dual treatment. Cooperativity regarding transcriptional induction and chromatin remodeling was demonstrated by interrogating the HIC1, CYP26A1, GBP4, and LYZ genes, in vivo gene derepression by expression studies on peripheral blood blasts from AML patients receiving DAC + ATRA. The two drugs also cooperated in derepression of transposable elements, more effectively in U937 (mutated TP53) than MOLM-13 (intact TP53), resulting in a “viral mimicry” response. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo, the antileukemic and gene-derepressive epigenetic activity of DAC is enhanced by ATRA.},

@article{merida-cerro_rat1_2024,
 abstract = {Certain DNA sequences can adopt a non-B form in the genome that interfere with DNA-templated processes, including transcription. Among the sequences that are intrinsically difficult to transcribe are those that tend to form R-loops, three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed by a DNA-RNA hybrid and the displaced ssDNA. Here we compared the transcription of an endogenous gene with and without an R-loop-forming sequence inserted. We show that, in agreement with previous in vivo and in vitro analyses, transcription elongation is delayed by R-loops in yeast. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Rat1 transcription terminator factor facilitates transcription throughout such structures by inducing premature termination of arrested RNAPIIs. We propose that RNase H degrades the RNA moiety of the hybrid, providing an entry site for Rat1. Thus, we have uncovered an unanticipated function of Rat1 as a transcription restoring factor opening up the possibility that it may also promote transcription through other genomic DNA structures intrinsically difficult to transcribe. If R-loop-mediated transcriptional stress is not relieved by Rat1, it will cause genomic instability, probably through the increase of transcription-replication conflicts, a deleterious situation that could lead to cancer.},

 abstract = {Air is a medium for dispersal of environmental DNA (eDNA) carried in bioaerosols, yet the atmosphere is mostly unexplored as a source of genetic material encompassing all domains of life. In this study, we designed and deployed a robust, sterilizable hardware system for airborne nucleic acid capture featuring active filtration of a quantifiable, controllable volume of air and a high-integrity chamber to protect the sample from loss or contamination. We used our hardware system on an aircraft across multiple height transects over major aerosolization sources to collect air eDNA, coupled with high-throughput amplicon sequencing using multiple DNA metabarcoding markers targeting bacteria, plants, and vertebrates to test the hypothesis of large-scale genetic presence of these bioaerosols throughout the planetary boundary layer in the lower troposphere. Here, we demonstrate that the multi-taxa DNA assemblages inventoried up to 2,500 m using our airplane-mounted hardware system are reflective of major aerosolization sources in the survey area and show previously unreported airborne species detections (i.e., Allium sativum L). We also pioneer an aerial survey flight grid standardized for atmospheric sampling of genetic material and aeroallergens using a light aircraft and limited resources. Our results show that air eDNA from terrestrial bacteria, plants, and vertebrates is detectable up to high altitude using our airborne air sampler and demonstrate the usefulness of light aircraft in monitoring campaigns. However, our work also underscores the need for improved marker choices and reference databases for species in the air column, particularly eukaryotes. Taken together, our findings reveal strong connectivity or mixing of terrestrial-associated eDNA from ground level aerosolization sources and the atmosphere, and we recommend that parameters and indices considering lifting action, atmospheric instability, and potential for convection be incorporated in future surveys for air eDNA. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for light aircraft campaigns to comprehensively and economically inventory bioaerosol emissions and impacts at scale, enabling transformative future opportunities in airborne DNA technology.},

In January 2021, the re-occurrence of COVID-19 infection was at its peak, considered the second wave of epidemics. In the initial stage, it was considered a double mutant strain due to two significant mutations observed in their Spike protein (E484Q and L452R). Although it was first detected in India later on, it was spread to several countries worldwide, causing high fatality due to this strain. In the present study, we investigated the spreading of B.1.617 strain worldwide through 822 genome sequences submitted in GISAID on 21 April 2021. All genome sequences were analyzed for variations in genome sequences based on their effects due to changes in nucleotides. At Allele frequency 0.05, there were a total of 47 variations in ORF1ab, 22 in Spike protein gene, 6 variations in N gene, 5 in ORF8 and M gene, four mutations in Orf7a, and one nucleotide substitution observed for ORF3a, ORF6 and ORF7b gene. The clustering for similar mutations mentioned B.1.617 sub-lineages. The outcome of this study established relative occurrence and spread worldwide. The study’s finding represented that “double mutant” strain is not only spread through traveling but it is also observed to evolve naturally with different mutations observed in B.1.617 lineage. The information extracted from the study helps to understand viral evolution and genome variations of B.1.617 lineage. The results support the need of separating B.1.617 into sub-lineages.},

@article{miao_putative_2020,
 abstract = {We present a novel method for automated identification of putative cell types from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. By iteratively applying a machine learning approach to an initial clustering of gene expression profiles of a given set of cells, we simultaneously identify distinct cell groups and a weighted list of feature genes for each group. The feature genes, which are differentially expressed in the particular cell group, jointly discriminate the given cell group from other cells. Each such group of cells corresponds to a putative cell type or state, characterised by the feature genes as markers. To benchmark this approach, we use expert-annotated scRNA-seq datasets from a range of experiments, as well as comparing to existing cell annotation methods, which are all based on a pre-existing reference. We show that our method automatically identifies the 'ground truth' cell assignments with high accuracy. Moreover, our method, Single Cell Clustering Assessment Framework (SCCAF) predicts new putative biologically meaningful cell-states in published data on haematopoiesis and the human cortex. SCCAF is available as an open-source software package on GitHub (https://github.com/SCCAF/sccaf) and as a Python package index and has also been implemented as a Galaxy tool in the Human Cell Atlas.},

Here, we generated a de novo transcriptome assembly of an intergeneric hybrid between apple and pear, accumulating intermediate levels of phloridzin and arbutin. Combining RNA-seq, in silico functional annotation prediction, targeted gene expression analysis, and expression–metabolite correlations, we identified candidate genes for functional characterization, resulting in the identification of active arbutin synthases in the hybrid and parental genotypes. Despite exhibiting an active arbutin synthase in vitro, the natural lack of arbutin in apples is reasoned by the absence of the substrate and broad substrate specificity. Altogether, our study serves as the basis for future assessment of potential physiological roles of identified genes by genome editing of hybrids and pears.},

@article{mitrofanov_crisprtracrrna_2022,
 abstract = {The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a Type II CRISPR system that has rapidly become the most versatile and widespread tool for genome engineering. It consists of two components, the Cas9 effector protein, and a single guide RNA that combines the spacer (for identifying the target) with the tracrRNA, a trans-activating small RNA required for both crRNA maturation and interference. While there are well-established methods for screening Cas effector proteins and CRISPR arrays, the detection of tracrRNA remains the bottleneck in detecting Class 2 CRISPR systems.We introduce a new pipeline CRISPRtracrRNA for screening and evaluation of tracrRNA candidates in genomes. This pipeline combines evidence from different components of the Cas9-sgRNA complex. The core is a newly developed structural model via covariance models from a sequence-structure alignment of experimentally validated tracrRNAs. As additional evidence, we determine the terminator signal (required for the tracrRNA transcription) and the RNA–RNA interaction between the CRISPR array repeat and the 5′-part of the tracrRNA.

 abstract = {Rice tungro disease (RTD), caused by Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) is one of the most prominent viral diseases in Asian countries. This virus disease problem seems to have been accentuated in those countries by causing a series of outbreaks over the years after being first reported in International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines, in 1963. One of the effective ways to combat viruses is through RNA silencing. microRNA is an important player in the RNA silencing mechanism. Genome sequences analysis shows RTBV-SP isolate (8 Kb) is composed of four open reading frames (ORF 1, ORF 2, ORF 3, and ORF 4), meanwhile, RTSV-SP (12 Kb) consists of one open reading frame encoded by seven different polyproteins (P1, CP1, CP2, CP3, NTP, Pro, and Rep). Therefore, this study investigated possible rice-encoded miRNAs targeted on RTBV and RTSV using in silico analysis. Five bioinformatics tools were employed using five different prediction algorithms: miRanda, RNA22, RNAhybrid, Tapirhybrid, and psRNATarget. The results revealed each RTBV and RTSV can be silenced by three potentially best candidate rice-encoded miRNA. For RTBV, osa-miR5510 (accession no. MIMAT0022143), osa-miR3980a-3p (accession no. MIMAT0019676), and osa-miR3980b-3p (accession no. MIMAT0019678) are being predicted by all five algorithms. Meanwhile, for RTSV, three miRNAs predicted are osa-miR414 (accession no. MIMAT0001330), osa-miR5505 (accession no. MIMAT00221138) and osa-miR167a-3p (accession no. MIMAT0006780). The predicted data provide useful material for developing RTBV and RTSV-resistant rice varieties.},

 abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women. The present study explored the potential role of pseudogenes in BC via construction and analysis of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network through a three-step process. First, we screened differentially expressed genes in nine BC datasets. Then the gene-pseudogenes pairs (nine hub genes) were selected according to the functional enrichment and correlation analysis. Second, the candidate hub genes and interacting miRNAs were used to construct the ceRNA network. Further analysis of the ceRNA network revealed a crucial ceRNA module with two genes-pseudogene pairs and two miRNAs. The in-depth analysis identified the GBP1/hsa-miR-30d-5p/GBP1P1 axis as a potential tumorigenic axis in BC patients. In the third step, the GBP1/hsa-miR-30d-5p/GBP1P1 axis expression level was assessed in 40 tumor/normal BC patients and MCF-7 cell lines. The expression of GBP1 and GBP1P1 was significantly higher in the tumor compared to the normal tissue. However, the expression of hsa-miR-30d-5p was lower in tumor samples. Then, we introduced the GBP1P1 pseudogene into the MCF-7 cell line to evaluate its effect on GBP1 and hsa-miR-30d-5p expression. As expected, the GBP1 level increased while the hsa-miR-30d-5p level decreased in the GBP1P1-overexprsssing cell line. In addition, the oncogenic properties of MCF-7 (cell viability, clonogenicity, and migration) were improved after GBP1P1 overexpression. In conclusion, we report a ceRNA network that may provide new insight into the role of pseudogenes in BC development.},

Marine environments are among such niche that host a huge number of microbes and have a complex environment which pose the need to study these bacterial indicators of horizontal gene transfer events for survival and stability. The plasmid content of the metagenomics data from 8 sediment samples of the Gulfs of Kathiawar and an open Arabian Sea sample was screened. The reads corresponding to hits against the plasmid database were assembled and studied for diversity using Kraken and functional content using MG-RAST. The sequences were also checked for resistome and virulence factors. The replicon hosts were overall dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria while red algae specific to the Kutch samples. The genes encoded were dominant in the flagella motility and type VI secretion systems. Overall, results from the study confirmed that the plasmids encoded traits for metal, antibiotic, and phage resistance along with virulence systems, and these would be conferring benefit to the hosts. The study throws insights into the environmental role of the plasmidome in adaptation of the microbes in the studied sites to the environmental stresses.},

 abstract = {There are currently no vaccines available to prevent and control of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an intracellular bacterial pathogen transmitted by ticks that occurs in many regions of the world and causes disease in a wide range of domestic and wild hosts, including humans. Vaccines induce long-lasting immunity and could prevent or reduce transmission of this pathogen. Understanding how vaccines induce a protective response can be difficult due to the complexity of the immune system, which operates at many levels throughout the organism. New perspectives in vaccinology, based on systems biology approaches, integrate many scientific disciplines to fully understand the biological responses to vaccination, where a transcriptomic approach could reveal relevant information of the host immune system, allowing profiling for rational design of vaccine formulations, administration, and potential protection. In the present study we report the gene expression profiles by RNA-seq followed by functional analysis using whole blood samples from rabbits immunized with a recombinant chimeric protein containing peptides from the MSP4 protein of A. phagocytophilum, which showed satisfactory results in terms of potential protection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression of 720 genes, with 346 genes upregulated and 374 genes downregulated. Overrepresentation of biological and metabolic pathways correlated with immune response, protein signaling, cytoskeleton organization and protein synthesis were found. These changes in gene expression could provide a complete and unique picture of the biological response to the epitope candidate vaccine against A. phagocytophilum in the host.},

Recent findings reported their functional role in cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the DNA methylation modifications of UNCEs in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from different mammal species. Methods: Fifty SCCs from 26 humans, 17 cats, 3 dogs, 1 horse, 1 bovine, 1 badger, and 1 porcupine were investigated. Fourteen feline stomatitis and normal samples from 36 healthy human donors, 7 cats, 5 dogs, 5 horses, 2 bovines and 1 badger were collected as normal controls. Bisulfite next generation sequencing evaluated the DNA methylation level from seven UCNEs (uc.160, uc.283, uc.416, uc.339, uc.270, uc.299, and uc.328). Results: 57/59 CpGs were significantly different according to the Kruskal\&ndash;Wallis test (p \&lt; 0.05) comparing normal samples with SCC. A common DNA hypermethylation pattern was observed in SCCs from all the species evaluated in this study, with an increasing trend of hypermethylation starting from normal mucosa, through stomatitis to SCC. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that UCNEs are hypermethylated in human SCC, and this behavior is also conserved among different species of mammals.},

While the main enzymatic steps of CHC biosynthesis are well understood, few of the underlying genes have been identified. Here we show how exploitation of intrasexual CHC dimorphism in a mason wasp, Odynerus spinipes, in combination with whole-genome sequencing and comparative transcriptomics facilitated identification of such genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of twelve candidate gene orthologs in the honey bee, Apis mellifera, confirmed nine genes impacting CHC profile composition. Most of them have predicted functions consistent with current knowledge of CHC metabolism. However, we found first-time evidence for a fatty acid amide hydrolase also influencing CHC profile composition. In situ hybridization experiments furthermore suggest trophocytes participating in CHC biosynthesis. Our results set the base for experimental CHC profile manipulation in Hymenoptera and imply that the evolutionary origin of CHC biosynthesis predates the arthropods’ colonization of land.},

The absence of gut microbiota diminished oxidative stress and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia from the brains of aged mice. Unbiased metabolomic analyses of serum and brain tissue revealed the accumulation of N6-carboxymethyllysine (CML) in the microglia of the aging brain. CML mediated a burst of reactive oxygen species and impeded mitochondrial activity and ATP reservoirs in microglia. We validated the age-dependent rise in CML levels in the sera and brains of humans. Finally, a microbiota-dependent increase in intestinal permeability in aged mice mediated the elevated levels of CML.

@article{mostafa_genome-wide_2024,
 abstract = {Changing climatic conditions with rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns pose significant challenges to agricultural productivity, particularly for common bean crops. Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial regulators that can mitigate the impact of biotic and abiotic stresses on crop production. The MADS-box TFs family has been implicated in various plant physiological processes, including stress-responsive mechanisms. However, their role in common bean and their response to stressful conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we identified 35 MADS-box gene family members in common bean, with conserved MADS-box domains and other functional domains. Gene duplication events were observed, suggesting the significance of duplication in the evolutionary development of gene families. The analysis of promoter regions revealed diverse elements, including stress-responsive elements, indicating their potential involvement in stress responses. Notably, PvMADS31, a member of the PvMADS-box gene family, demonstrated rapid upregulation under various abiotic stress conditions, including NaCl, polyethylene glycol, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Transgenic plants overexpressing PvMADS31 displayed enhanced lateral root development, root elongation, and seed germination under stress conditions. Furthermore, PvMADS31 overexpression in Arabidopsis resulted in improved drought tolerance, likely attributed to the enhanced scavenging of ROS and increased proline accumulation. These findings suggest that PvMADS31 might play a crucial role in modulating seed germination, root development, and stress responses, potentially through its involvement in auxin and ABA signaling pathways. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential roles of PvMADS-box genes in abiotic stress responses in common bean, offering prospects for crop improvement strategies to enhance resilience under changing environmental conditions.},

Samples before and after weight loss were analyzed by miRNA-seq and delta miRNA levels ranked according to p-value. Levels of miRNAs 25, 93 and 106 that are expressed from a common genomic cluster were reduced after weight loss. Those results were substantiated in a qPCR analysis of 46 additional patients. This is in accordance with mouse data showing a functional involvement of this cluster in obesity. Correlation of the changes in miRNA abundance with SNP genotypes revealed a statistical association of all three miRNAs with known obesity susceptibility SNPs.
Conclusion
Diet induced weight loss leads to SNP dependent modulation of miRNAs from the miR 25/93/106 gene cluster in humans.},

We carried out a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) loss-of-function screen for human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) targeting 2098 deregulated genes using a customized algorithm to comprehensively probe the functionality of every resolvable transcriptional start site (TSS). CASP8AP2 was identified as the only hit that significantly affected the viability of all eight screened LUAD cell lines while the viability of non-transformed lung cells was only moderately impacted. Knockdown (KD) of CASP8AP2 induced both autophagy and apoptotic cell death pathways. Systematic expression profiling linked the AP-1 transcription factor to the CASP8AP2 KD-induced cancer cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of AP-1 reverted the CASP8AP2 silencing-induced phenotype. Overall, the tailored CRISPRi screen profiled the impact of over 2000 genes on the survival of eight LUAD cell lines and identified the CASP8AP2 – AP-1 axis mediating lung cancer viability.},

@article{ngo_histone_2022,
 abstract = {Background

Epigenetic modulators have been proposed as promising new drug targets to treat adverse remodeling in heart failure. Here, we evaluated the potential of 4 epigenetic drugs, including the recently developed histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor JS28, to prevent endothelin‐1 induced pathological gene expression in cardiac myocytes and analyzed the chromatin binding profile of the respective inhibitor targets.

Methods and Results

Cardiac myocytes were differentiated and puromycin‐selected from mouse embryonic stem cells and treated with endothelin‐1 to induce pathological gene expression (938 differentially expressed genes, q{\textless}0.05). Dysregulation of gene expression was at least in part prevented by epigenetic inhibitors, including the pan‐BRD (bromodomain‐containing protein) inhibitor bromosporine (290/938 genes), the BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) inhibitor JQ1 (288/938), the broad‐spectrum HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (227/938), and the HDAC6 inhibitor JS28 (210/938). Although the 4 compounds were similarly effective toward pathological gene expression, JS28 demonstrated the least adverse effects on physiological gene expression. Genome‐wide chromatin binding profiles revealed that HDAC6 binding sites were preferentially associated with promoters of genes involved in RNA processing. In contrast, BRD4 binding was associated with genes involved in core cardiac myocyte functions, for example, myocyte contractility, and showed enrichment at enhancers and intronic regions. These distinct chromatin binding profiles of HDAC6 and BRD4 might explain the different effects of their inhibitors on pathological versus physiological gene expression.

Conclusions

In summary, we demonstrated, that the HDAC6 inhibitor JS28 effectively prevented the adverse effects of endothelin‐1 on gene expression with minor impact on physiological gene expression in cardiac myocytes. Selective HDAC6 inhibition by JS28 appears to be a promising strategy for future evaluation in vivo and potential translation into clinical application.},

However, attacks of gall rust disease by Uromycladium falcatariae is difficult to manage. Understanding sengon genes expressions when artificially infected with gall rust fungi can help unravel its resistance mechanisms. Total RNA was extracted from sengon seedlings samples inoculated with U. falcatariae fungi at 7, 21, and 35 days after inoculation (DAI) and from the control group. Total RNA sequencing was performed using the PCR-cDNA Sequencing protocol (SQK-PCB109) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The RNA-Seq obtained varies from 1.3 million to 1.9 million total reads. The assembled full-length transcript was constructed using the RATTLE program, resulting in 21,819 transcripts. The TransDecoder program used to define open reading frames (ORFs) generated 2,342 transcripts, of which 34.15\% were 5′prime\_partial, 8.15\% were 3′prime\_partial, 8.5\% were internal, and 49.14\% were complete. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between resistant and susceptible seedlings, found that 1,013 genes that were up-regulated and 1,130 genes that were down-regulated in the resistant lines. The transcriptome data discussed in this article have been deposited in the DDBJ with accession number DRA015681.},

Physicochemical analysis revealed that electrical conductivity (312 µS/cm), cation exchange capacity (15.62 meq/100g), phosphate (0.16 mg/kg), nitrogen (1.53 mg/kg), moisture (19.45 mg/kg), potassium (1.39 mg/kg), magnesium (0.61 mg/kg), clay (60 \%), and silt (35\%) were higher in bulk soil than rhizosphere soil. The 16S rRNA metagenomic sequences quantified a total of 89341 bacterial taxonomic units from bulk soil which consist of 10 phyla, 13 classes, 16 orders, 18 families, 21 genera, and 19 species. A total of 88034 bacterial taxonomic units which comprised of 9 phyla, 13 classes, 23 orders, 22 families, 26 genera, and 25 species, were found in rhizosphere soil. The most abundant phyla in bulk soil are Actinobacteria (31\%), Proteobacteria (26\%), and Gemmatimonadetes (17\%) Acidobacteria (17\%) and Planctomycetes (3\%) while the prominent phyla in rhizosphere soil are Actinobacteria (63\%) Proteobacteria (24\%), Acidobacteria (7\%) and Planctomycetes (3\%). The major functional profiles of bacterial communities in both bulk and rhizosphere soils are metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, terpenoids, polyketides, cofactors, and xenobiotic degradation. Alpha diversities among the bacterial community were higher in Simpson’s reciprocal index for both bulk and rhizosphere soils. This study opens up new frontiers in expanding metagenomics studies on environmental samples which would capture and contribute to the identification of soil bacteria useful to ecosystem functions.},

 abstract = {Domain experts are increasingly employing machine learning to solve their domain-specific problems. This article presents to software engineering researchers the six key challenges that a domain expert faces in addressing their problem with a computational workflow, and the underlying executable implementation. These challenges arise out of our conceptual framework which presents the “route” of transformations that a domain expert may choose to take while developing their solution. To ground our conceptual framework in the state of the practice, this article discusses a selection of available textual and graphical workflow systems and their support for the transformations described in our framework. Example studies from the literature in various domains are also examined to highlight the tools used by the domain experts as well as a classification of the domain specificity and machine learning usage of their problem, workflow, and implementation. The state of the practice informs our discussion of the six key challenges, where we identify which challenges and transformations are not sufficiently addressed by available tools. We also suggest possible research directions for software engineering researchers to increase the automation of these tools and disseminate best-practice techniques between software engineering and various scientific domains.},

@article{oger_-cellspecific_2023,
 abstract = {The loss of pancreatic β-cell identity has emerged as an important feature of type 2 diabetes development, but the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we explore the cell-autonomous role of the cell-cycle regulator and transcription factor E2F1 in the maintenance of β-cell identity, insulin secretion, and glucose homeostasis. We show that the β-cell–specific loss of E2f1 function in mice triggers glucose intolerance associated with defective insulin secretion, altered endocrine cell mass, downregulation of many β-cell genes, and concomitant increase of non–β-cell markers. Mechanistically, epigenomic profiling of the promoters of these non–β-cell upregulated genes identified an enrichment of bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 or H3K27me3 marks. Conversely, promoters of downregulated genes were enriched in active chromatin H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks. We find that specific E2f1 transcriptional, cistromic, and epigenomic signatures are associated with these β-cell dysfunctions, with E2F1 directly regulating several β-cell genes at the chromatin level. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of E2F transcriptional activity in human islets also impairs insulin secretion and the expression of β-cell identity genes. Our data suggest that E2F1 is critical for maintaining β-cell identity and function through sustained control of β-cell and non–β-cell transcriptional programs.β-Cell–specific E2f1 deficiency in mice impairs glucose tolerance.Loss of E2f1 function alters the ratio of α- to β-cells but does not trigger β-cell conversion into α-cells.Pharmacological inhibition of E2F activity inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and alters β- and α-cell gene expression in human islets.E2F1 maintains β-cell function and identity through control of transcriptomic and epigenetic programs.},

@article{olagoke_rps6_2023,
 abstract = {The use of insects to model molecular events that characterize degenerative conditions was originally met with scepticism. However, the discovery of insect insulin-like peptides in the 1970's and the demonstration of evolutionary conservation of insulin-related signalling from insects to mammals have highlighted the importance and reduced cost of insect models in biomedical research. Here, we expand on our earlier described modelling of streptozotocin-induced brain glucose metabolic disruption in Nauphoeta cinerea, using RNA-sequencing analysis to study the transcriptional and genetic signatures of degeneration and stress signalling when glucose levels are elevated in the brain of the lobster cockroach. Nymphs were randomly divided into three groups: Control (0.8\% NaCl), and two single streptozotocin injection doses (74 nmol and 740 nmol). The transcriptional analyses featured a dysregulation of 226 genes at high dose STZ treatment and 278 genes at the low dose. Our mRNA-sequencing data showed that ribosomal protein genes were the most upregulated genes at both 74 and 740 nmol STZ treatment. We therefore used RT-qPCR and relative transcriptional methods to validate our proposed mechanism of brain glucose toxicity-induced degeneration in Nauphoeta cinerea, which involved the upregulation of ribosomal proteins and rpS6 regulators (mTORC1, protein kinases, casein kinase 1 and Death-associated protein kinase), the upregulation of MAPK cascades (RAS, ERK, P38 and JNK), alongside the downregulation of the PI3K/AKT cascade. Taken together, this study highlights the remarkable opportunity for Nauphoeta cinerea use as an experimental organism in hyperglycaemia, degeneration, and stress signalling.},

 abstract = {The apoplast performs important functions in the plant, such as defense against stress, and compounds present form the apoplastic washing fluid (AWF). The fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of witches' broom disease (WBD) in Theobroma cacao L., initially colonizes the apoplast in its biotrophic phase. In this period, the fungus can remain for approximately 60 days, until it changes to its second phase, causing tissue death and consequently large loss in the production of beans. To better understand the importance of the apoplast in the T. cacao-M. perniciosa interaction, we performed the first apoplastic proteomic mapping of two contrasting genotypes for WBD resistance (CCN51 - resistant and Catongo-susceptible). Based on two-dimensional gel analysis, we identified 36 proteins in CCN-51 and 15 in Catongo. We highlight PR-proteins, such as peroxidases, β-1, 3-glucanases and chitinases. A possible candidate for a resistance marker of the CCN-51 genotype, osmotin, was identified. The antioxidative metabolism of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme showed a significant increase (p{\textless}0.05) in the AWF of the two genotypes under field conditions (FD). T. cacao AWF inhibited the germination of M. perniciosa basidiospores ({\textgreater}80\%), in addition to causing morphological changes. Our results shed more light on the nature of the plant's defense performed by the apoplast in the T. cacao-M. perniciosa interaction in the initial (biotrophic) phase of fungal infection, and therefore make it possible to expand WBD control strategies based on the identification of potential targets for resistance markers and advance scientific knowledge of the disease.},

 abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, RNA-seq datasets were produced to investigate the virus–host relationship. However, much of these data remains underexplored. To improve the search for molecular targets and biomarkers, we performed an integrated analysis of multiple RNA-seq datasets, expanding the cohort and including patients from different countries, encompassing severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Our analysis revealed that severe COVID-19 patients exhibit overexpression of genes coding for proteins of extracellular exosomes, endomembrane system, and neutrophil granules (e.g., S100A9, LY96, and RAB1B), which may play an essential role in the cellular response to infection. Concurrently, these patients exhibit down-regulation of genes encoding components of the T cell receptor complex and nucleolus, including TP53, IL2RB, and NCL. Finally, SPI1 may emerge as a central transcriptional factor associated with the up-regulated genes, whereas TP53, MYC, and MAX were associated with the down-regulated genes during COVID-19. This study identified targets and transcriptional factors, lighting on the molecular pathophysiology of syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.},

Vast amounts of sequence data can be generated in short periods of time. Regarding ophthalmology and vision research, extensive interrogation of patient samples for underlying causative DNA mutations has resulted in the discovery of many new genes relevant to eye disease. However, such analysis remains functionally limited. RNA-sequencing accurately snapshots thousands of genes, capturing many subtypes of RNA molecules, and has become the gold standard for transcriptome gene expression quantification. RNA-sequencing has the potential to advance our understanding of eye development and disease; it can reveal new candidates to improve our molecular diagnosis rates and highlight therapeutic targets for intervention. But with a wide range of applications, the design of such experiments can be problematic, no single optimal pipeline exists, and therefore, several considerations must be undertaken for optimal study design. We review the key steps involved in RNA-sequencing experimental design and the downstream bioinformatic pipelines used for differential gene expression. We provide guidance on the application of RNAsequencing to ophthalmology and sources of open-access eye-related data sets.},

 abstract = {Carbapenem and colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, have become a growing global concern, posing a significant threat to public health. Currently, there is limited information about the genetic background of carbapenem and colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates infecting humans and dogs in Thailand. This study aimed to characterize carbapenem and colistin-resistant genes in six resistant K. pneumoniae clinical isolates (three from humans and three from dogs) which differed in their pulse field gel electrophoresis profiles. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing were employed to identify and analyze the isolates. All six isolates were carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates with chromosomally carried blaSHV, fosA, oqxA and oqxB genes, as well as nine to 21 virulence genes. The isolates belonged to five multilocus sequence types (STs): one isolate from a human and one from a dog belonged to ST16, with the other two human isolates being from ST340 and ST1269 and the other two dog isolates were ST147 and ST15. One human isolate and two dog isolates harbored the same blaOXA-232 gene on the ColKP3 plasmid, and one dog isolate carried the blaOXA-48 gene on the IncFII plasmid. Notably, one human isolate exhibited resistance to colistin mediated by the mcr-3.5 gene carried on the IncFII plasmid, which co-existed with resistance determinants to other antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and quinolones. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive characterization of both chromosome- and plasmid-mediated carbapenem and colistin resistance in a set of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates from unrelated humans and dogs in Thailand. The similarities and differences found contribute to our understanding of the potential widescale dissemination of these important resistance genes among clinical isolates from humans and animals, which in turn may contribute to outbreaks of emerging resistant clones in hospital settings.},

 abstract = {Worldwide, bacterial resistance is one of the most severe public health problems. Currently, the failure of antibiotics to counteract superbugs highlights the need to search for new molecules with antimicrobial potential to combat them. The objective of this research was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 against Gram-negative bacteria. Thirty yeasts and thirty-two Bacillus isolates were tested following the agar well-diffusion method. Four Bacillus sp. strains (BS3, BS4, BS17, and BS21) showed antagonistic activity against E. coli ATCC 25922 using bacterial culture (BC) and the cell-free supernatant (CFS), where the BS4 strain stood out, showing inhibitory values of 20.50 ± 0.70 mm and 19.67 ± 0.58 mm for BC and CFS, respectively. The Bacillus sp. BS4 strain can produce antioxidant, non-hemolytic, and antimicrobial metabolites that exhibit activity against several microorganisms such as Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis. According to the characterization of the supernatant, the metabolites could be proteinaceous. The production of these metabolites is influenced by carbon and nitrogen sources. The most suitable medium to produce antimicrobial metabolites was TSB broth. The one-factor-at-a-time method was used to standardize parameters such as pH, agitation, temperature, carbon source, nitrogen source, and salts, resulting in the best conditions of pH 7, 150 rpm, 28 °C, starch (2.5 g/L), tryptone (20 g/L), and magnesium sulfate (0.2 g/L), respectively. Moreover, the co-culture was an excellent strategy to improve antimicrobial activity, achieving maximum antimicrobial activity with an inhibition zone of 21.85 ± 1.03 mm. These findings position the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 strain as a promising candidate for producing bioactive molecules with potential applications in human health.},

 abstract = {Stomatopods are well studied for their unique visual systems, which can consist of up to 16 different photoreceptor types and 33 opsin proteins expressed in the adults of some species. The light-sensing abilities of larval stomatopods are comparatively less well understood with limited information about the opsin repertoire of these early-life stages. Early work has suggested that larval stomatopods may not possess the extensive light detection abilities found in their adult counterparts. However, recent studies have shown that these larvae may have more complex photosensory systems than previously thought. To examine this idea at the molecular level, we characterized the expression of putative light-absorbing opsins across developmental stages, from embryo to adult, in the stomatopod species Pullosquilla thomassini using transcriptomic methods with a special focus on ecological and physiological transition periods. Opsin expression during the transition from the larval to the adult stage was further characterized in the species Gonodactylaceus falcatus. Opsin transcripts from short, middle, and long wavelength-sensitive clades were found in both species, and analysis of spectral tuning sites suggested differences in absorbance within these clades. This is the first study to document the changes in opsin repertoire across development in stomatopods, providing novel evidence for light detection across the visual spectrum in larvae.},

 abstract = {Investigations of the molecular mechanisms behind detection of short, and particularly ultraviolet, wavelengths in arthropods have relied heavily on studies from insects due to the relative ease of heterologous expression of modified opsin proteins in model organisms like Drosophila. However, species outside of the Insecta can provide information on mechanisms for spectral tuning as well as the evolutionary history of pancrustacean visual pigments. Here we investigate the basis of spectral tuning in malacostracan short wavelength sensitive (SWS) opsins using phylogenetic comparative methods. Tuning sites that may be responsible for the difference between ultraviolet (UV) and violet visual pigment absorbance in the Malacostraca are identified, and the idea that an amino acid polymorphism at a single site is responsible for this shift is shown to be unlikely. Instead, we suggest that this change in absorbance is accomplished through multiple amino acid substitutions. On the basis of our findings, we conducted further surveys to identify spectral tuning mechanisms in the order Stomatopoda where duplication of UV opsins has occurred. Ancestral state reconstructions of stomatopod opsins from two main clades provide insight into the amino acid changes that lead to differing absorption by the visual pigments they form, and likely contribute the basis for the wide array of UV spectral sensitivities found in this order.},

 abstract = {African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a lethal animal pathogen that enters its host cells through endocytosis. So far, host factors specifically required for ASFV replication have been barely identified. In this study a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in porcine cells indicated that the genes RFXANK, RFXAP, SLA-DMA, SLA-DMB, and CIITA are important for productive ASFV infection. The proteins encoded by these genes belong to the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II), or swine leucocyte antigen complex II (SLA II). RFXAP and CIITA are MHC II-specific transcription factors, whereas SLA-DMA/B are subunits of the non-classical MHC II molecule SLA-DM. Targeted knockout of either of these genes led to severe replication defects of different ASFV isolates, reflected by substantially reduced plating efficiency, cell-to-cell spread, progeny virus titers and viral DNA replication. Transgene-based reconstitution of SLA-DMA/B fully restored the replication capacity demonstrating that SLA-DM, which resides in late endosomes, plays a crucial role during early steps of ASFV infection.},

 abstract = {The NIPBL/MAU2 heterodimer loads cohesin onto chromatin. Mutations in NIPBL account for most cases of the rare developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). Here we report a MAU2 variant causing CdLS, a deletion of seven amino acids that impairs the interaction between MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus. Investigating this interaction, we discovered that MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus are largely dispensable for normal cohesin and NIPBL function in cells with a NIPBL early truncating mutation. Despite a predicted fatal outcome of an out-of-frame single nucleotide duplication in NIPBL, engineered in two different cell lines, alternative translation initiation yields a form of NIPBL missing N-terminal residues. This form cannot interact with MAU2, but binds DNA and mediates cohesin loading. Altogether, our work reveals that cohesin loading can occur independently of functional NIPBL/MAU2 complexes and highlights a novel mechanism protective against out-of-frame mutations that is potentially relevant for other genetic conditions.},

 abstract = {Garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.) is a Brassicaceae crop recognized as a healthy vegetable and a medicinal plant. Lepidium is one of the largest genera in Brassicaceae, yet, the genus has not been a focus of extensive genomic research. In the present work, garden cress genome was sequenced using the long read high-fidelity sequencing technology. A de novo, draft genome assembly that spans 336.5 Mb was produced, corresponding to 88.6\% of the estimated genome size and representing 90\% of the evolutionarily expected orthologous gene content. Protein coding gene content was structurally predicted and functionally annotated, resulting in the identification of 25,668 putative genes. A total of 599 candidate disease resistance genes were identified by predicting resistance gene domains in gene structures, and 37 genes were detected as orthologs of heavy metal associated protein coding genes. In addition, 4289 genes were assigned as “transcription factor coding.” Six different machine learning algorithms were trained and tested for their performance in classifying miRNA coding genomic sequences. Logistic regression proved the best performing trained algorithm, thus utilized for pre-miRNA coding loci identification in the assembly. Repetitive DNA analysis involved the characterization of transposable element and microsatellite contents. L. sativum chloroplast genome was also assembled and functionally annotated. Data produced in the present work is expected to constitute a foundation for genomic research in garden cress and contribute to genomics-assisted crop improvement and genome evolution studies in the Brassicaceae family.},

This study investigated the association of azoospermia factor (AZF) region microdeletions with unsuccessful assisted reproductive techniques (ART), including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).This cross-sectional analysis study examined 80 Iranian oligospermic men (mean age 34 years) with prior failed ICSI and IVF cycles (IR.IAU.TNB.REC.1401.041). Semen analysis evaluated quantity/quality parameters based on World Health Organization guidelines. Participants were stratified by sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) levels into: control (SDF \&lt; 15\%, n = 20), mild elevation (15\% ≤ SDF ≤ 30\%, n = 60), and high (SDF \&gt; 30\%, n = 20). Multiplex PCR mapped AZF microdeletions in the high SDF group. The AZF-associated genes were selected by RNA Seq analysis, and the candidate genes were checked for expression level by real-time PCR.High SDF individuals exhibited poorer semen metrics, including 69\% lower sperm concentration (P = 0.04) than those without SDF. Of this subset, 45\% (9/20 men) harboured predominately AZF microdeletions. Men with AZF microdeletions showed higher SDF (32\% vs 21\%, P = 0.02) and altered AZF-associated genes expression. As USP9Y 3-fold, UTY 1.3-fold, and BPY2 1-fold revealed up-regulation, while IQCF1 8-fold, CDY 6.5-fold, DAZ 6-fold, and DDX3Y 1-fold underwent down-regulation. The PAWP gene was also down-regulated (5.7-fold, P = 0.029) in the IVF/ICSI failure group.AZF microdeletions significantly impact male infertility and ART outcomes. High SDF individuals exhibited poorer semen metrics, with 45\% AZF microdeletions. These microdeletions altered AZF-associated genes expression, affecting fertility mediator PAWP independently. Dual AZF and SDF screening enables personalized management in severe male infertility, potentially explaining IVF/ICSI failures.},

In our study, we test the efficacy of the DNA-hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which has been shown to possess little systemic adverse effects. Screening a broad panel of 56 NSCLC cell lines uncovered a decrease in cell viability after the combination treatment in 77\% of the cell lines. Transcriptomics, proteomics, proliferation and migration profiling revealed that fast proliferating and slowly migrating cell lines were more sensitive to the drug combination. The comparison of mutational profiles found oncogenic KRAS mutations only in sensitive cells. Additionally, different cell lines showed a heterogeneous gene expression response to the treatment pointing to diverse mechanisms of action. Silencing KRAS, RIG-I or RARB partially reversed the sensitivity of KRAS-mutant NCI-H460 cells. To study resistance, we generated two NCI-H460 cell populations resistant to ATRA and DAC, which migrated faster and proliferated slower than the parental sensitive cells and showed signs of senescence. In summary, this comprehensive dataset uncovers a broad sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the combinatorial treatment with DAC and ATRA and indicates that migration and proliferation capacities correlate with and could thus serve as determinants for drug sensitivity in NSCLC.},

 abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a continuum of disorders among which non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is particularly associated with a negative prognosis. Hepatocyte lipotoxicity is one of the main pathogenic factors of liver fibrosis and NASH. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this process are poorly understood. The main aim of this study was to dissect transcriptional mechanisms regulated by lipotoxicity in hepatocytes. We achieved this aim by combining transcriptomic, proteomic and chromatin accessibility analyses from human liver and mouse hepatocytes. This integrative approach revealed several transcription factor networks deregulated by NASH and lipotoxicity. To validate these predictions, genetic deletion of the transcription factors MAFK and TCF4 was performed, resulting in hepatocytes that were better protected against saturated fatty acid oversupply. MAFK- and TCF4-regulated gene expression profiles suggest a mitigating effect against cell stress, while promoting cell survival and growth. Moreover, in the context of lipotoxicity, some MAFK and TCF4 target genes were to the corresponding differentially regulated transcripts in human liver fibrosis. Collectively, our findings comprehensively profile the transcriptional response to lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, revealing new molecular insights and providing a valuable resource for future endeavours to tackle the molecular mechanisms of NASH.},

 abstract = {The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B is implicated in recessive intellectual disability disorders, and heterozygous, protein-truncating variants in KDM5B are associated with reduced cognitive function in the population. The KDM5 family of lysine demethylases has developmental and homeostatic functions in the brain, some of which appear to be independent of lysine demethylase activity. To determine the functions of KDM5B in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we first studied male and female mice homozygous for a Kdm5bΔARID allele that lacks demethylase activity. Kdm5bΔARID/ΔARID mice exhibited hyperactivity and long-term memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks. The expression of immediate early, activity-dependent genes was downregulated in these mice and hyperactivated upon a learning stimulus compared with wild-type (WT) mice. A number of other learning-associated genes were also significantly dysregulated in the Kdm5bΔARID/ΔARID hippocampus. Next, we knocked down Kdm5b specifically in the adult, WT mouse hippocampus with shRNA. Kdm5b knockdown resulted in spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and long-term potentiation deficits. These findings identify KDM5B as a critical regulator of gene expression and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus and suggest that at least some of the cognitive phenotypes associated with KDM5B gene variants are caused by direct effects on memory consolidation mechanisms.},

 abstract = {The recent improvements in mass spectrometry instruments and new analytical methods are increasing the intersection between proteomics and big data science. In addition, bioinformatics analysis is becoming increasingly complex and convoluted, involving multiple algorithms and tools. A wide variety of methods and software tools have been developed for computational proteomics and metabolomics during recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. However, most of the computational proteomics and metabolomics tools are designed as single-tiered software application where the analytics tasks can't be distributed, limiting the scalability and reproducibility of the data analysis. In this paper we summarise the key steps of metabolomics and proteomics data processing, including the main tools and software used to perform the data analysis. We discuss the combination of software containers with workflows environments for large scale metabolomics and proteomics analysis. Finally, we introduce to the proteomics and metabolomics communities a new approach for reproducible and large-scale data analysis based on BioContainers and two of the most popular workflow environments: Galaxy and Nextflow.

 abstract = {Metastasierung und Therapieresistenz stellen die wesentlichen Hindernisse bei der kurativen Behandlung des Kolorektalkarzinoms (KRK) dar und sind Hauptursache für die krebsbedingte Sterblichkeit. Bei etwa einem Viertel der KRK-Patient*innen liegen bei Erstdiagnose Fernmetastasen vor, bei ca. der Hälfte der Erkrankten treten im Verlauf Fernmetastasen auf (Kumbrink et al., 2021; Van Cutsem \& Oliveira, 2009; Vatandoust et al., 2015). 
Fluoropyrimidin-basierte Chemotherapieregime sind das Grundgerüst der systemischen KRK-Therapie, welche durch weitere klassische Zytostatika sowie Antikörper-basierte Wirkstoffe erweitert werden kann. Das Kombinationsschema bestehend aus 5-Fluoruracil, Irinotecan und Leucovorin – syn. FOLFIRI – wird bei metastasiertem KRK (mKRK) als Erst- oder Zweitlinientherapie eingesetzt (Leitlinienprogramm Onkologie (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft, 2019). Trotz der Wirksamkeit dieser Kombinationsbehandlung, durch die die Überlebensrate deutlich verbessert werden konnte, führen intrinsische und erworbene Resistenzmechanismen zur Progression der Krankheit (Jensen et al., 2015; Lyskjær et al., 2019).

Um molekularen Mechanismen und Biomarker der FOLFIRI-Resistenz auf Transkriptomebene zu identifizieren, wurden aus den KRK -Zelllinien Colo205, HT29 und SW480 drei FOLFIRI-resistente Subzelllinien durch kontinuierliche Behandlung mit steigenden FOLFIRI-Konzentrationen hergestellt. Als biologische Effekte der FOLFIRI-Resistenz konnten Änderungen in der Genexpression, morphologische Veränderungen sowie Anpassung des Zellzyklus und Zelltod-Resistenz beobachtet werden. 

Zur Identifikation von resistenz-assoziierten Expressionssignaturen oder potentiell prognostischen Biomarkern wurde eine RNA-Sequenzierung der parentalen sowie der resistenten Zelllinien durchgeführt. 
Insgesamt 284 differentiell exprimierte Gene (DEGs) wurden nach der bioinformatischen Analyse der RNA-Sequenzierung von 24 Proben ermittelt (Colo205: 222 Gene, HT29: 47 Gene, SW480: 30 Gene). Anschließend wurden diese DEGs miteinander abgeglichen und 12 DEGs identifiziert, die in zwei oder allen drei Zelllinien konsistent dysreguliert waren. Mittels Kaplan-Meier (KM-) Überlebenszeitanalyse des Kolon-Adenokarzinom-Datensatz (COAD) des Krebsgenomatlas (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA, PanCancer Atlas Datenset ) wurden hieraus drei prognostisch relevante Gene (TACSTD2, PERP und CAV2) identifiziert, die sich signifikant mit kürzerem Überleben bei KRK assoziiert zeigten. 
Diese Ergebnisse wurden mit den Ergebnissen einer klinischen Studie (GSE62322) abgeglichen. In dieser Studie wurden von 21 Chemotherapie-naiven KRK-Patient*innen Tumorproben entnommen, worauf eine postoperative Chemotherapie mit FOLFIRI folgte. Um eine Gensignatur zu identifizieren, die das Ansprechen auf FOLFIRI vorhersagen soll, wurden im nächsten Schritt die Expressionsdaten der auf FOLFIRI ansprechenden Patient*innen mit denen der nicht auf FOLFIRI ansprechenden Patient*innen verglichen. 
Im Abgleich mit diesen Expressionsdaten konnten die drei Gene TACSTD2, PERP und CAV2 nicht als signifikant dysreguliert bzw. als Teil der Gensignatur nachgewiesen werden. Jedoch konnten die Gene SERPINE2 und TNC aus der Liste aller 284 DEGs in den klinischen Tumorproben ebenfalls als signifikant differentiell exprimiert nachgewiesen werden und mittels KM-Überlebenszeitanalyse als prognostisch relevant eingestuft werden. 
Diese drei bzw. fünf identifizierten Gene können nun Grundlage für weitere experimentelle Schritte sein, um neue diagnostische und prognostische Biomarker für die klinische Praxis zu etablieren.},

 abstract = {Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 70\% of deaths world-wide. Previous work has linked NCDs such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) to disruption of chromatin regulators. However, the exact molecular origins of these chronic conditions remain elusive. Here, we identify the H4 lysine 16 acetyltransferase MOF as a critical regulator of central carbon metabolism. High-throughput metabolomics unveil a systemic amino acid and carbohydrate imbalance in Mof deficient mice, manifesting in T2D predisposition. Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) reveals defects in glucose assimilation and insulin secretion in these animals. Furthermore, Mof deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced fat gain due to defects in glucose uptake in adipose tissue. MOF-mediated H4K16ac deposition controls expression of the master regulator of glucose metabolism, Pparg and the entire downstream transcriptional network. Glucose uptake and lipid storage can be reconstituted in MOF-depleted adipocytes in vitro by ectopic Glut4 expression, PPARγ agonist thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment or SIRT1 inhibition. Hence, chronic imbalance in H4K16ac promotes a destabilisation of metabolism triggering the development of a metabolic disorder, and its maintenance provides an unprecedented regulatory epigenetic mechanism controlling diet-induced obesity.},

 abstract = {Despite substantial heterogeneity of studies, there is evidence that antibiotics commonly used in primary care influence the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in terms of changing their composition and/or diversity. Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) from the food and medicinal plant nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) is known for its antimicrobial activity and is used for the treatment of infections of the draining urinary tract and upper respiratory tract. Against this background, we raised the question of whether a 14 d nasturtium intervention (3 g daily, N = 30 healthy females) could also impact the normal gut microbiota composition. Spot urinary BITC excretion highly correlated with a weak but significant antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli. A significant increase in human beta defensin 1 as a parameter for host defense was seen in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) upon verum intervention. Pre-to-post analysis revealed that mean gut microbiome composition did not significantly differ between groups, nor did the circulating serum metabolome. On an individual level, some large changes were observed between sampling points, however. Explorative Spearman rank correlation analysis in subgroups revealed associations between gut microbiota and the circulating metabolome, as well as between changes in blood markers and bacterial gut species.},

@article{phillip_molecular_2023,
 abstract = {Background: There is a growing body of evidence on the potential involvement of coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) in causing urinary tract infections (UTIs). The aim of this study was to delineate virulence potential, antimicrobial resistance genes, and sequence types of CoNS isolated from patients with UTI symptoms and pyuria in Tanzania. Methods: CoNS from patients with UTI symptoms and more than 125 leucocytes/μL were retrieved, subcultured, and whole-genome sequenced. Results: Out of 65 CoNS isolates, 8 species of CoNS were identified; Staphylococcus haemolyticus, n = 27 (41.5\%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, n = 24 (36.9\%), were predominant. The majority of S. haemolyticus were sequence type (ST) 30, with 8 new ST138-145 reported, while the majority of S. epidermidis were typed as ST490 with 7 new ST1184-1190 reported. Sixty isolates (92.3\%) had either one or multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. The most frequently detected resistance genes were 53 (21\%) dfrG, 32 (12.9\%) blaZ, and 26 (10.5\%) mecA genes conferring resistance to trimethoprim, penicillin, and methicillin, respectively. Out of 65 isolates, 59 (90.8\%) had virulence genes associated with UTI, with a predominance of the icaC 47 (46.5\%) and icaA 14 (13.9\%) genes. Conclusion:S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis harboring icaC, dfrG, blaZ, and mecA genes were the predominant CoNS causing UTI in Tanzania. Laboratories should carefully interpret the significant bacteriuria due to CoNS in relation to UTI symptoms and pyuria before labeling them as contaminants. Follow-up studies to document the outcome of the treated patients is needed to add more evidence that CoNS are UTI pathogens.},

M. massiliense has been associated with different oral pathologies and was co-isolated with the Synergistetes bacterium Pyramidobacter piscolens (P. piscolens) in one case of severe periodontitis. Here, reporting on two additional necrotic pulp cases yielded the opportunity to characterise two co-cultivated M. massiliense isolates, both with P. piscolens, as non-motile, 1–2-µm-long and 0.6–0.8-µm-wide Gram-positive coccobacilli which were autofluorescent at 420 nm. The two whole genome sequences featured a 31.3\% GC content, gapless 1,834,388-base-pair chromosome exhibiting an 85.9\% coding ratio, encoding a formate dehydrogenase promoting M. massiliense growth without hydrogen in GG medium.

None of the species in this genus have their mitochondrial genome described, which is highly valuable in phylogenetic and molecular evolution studies. For the present work, eight species from the Neoarius genus were selected: Neoarius utarus, Neoarius midgleyi, Neoarius graeffei, Neoarius leptaspis, Neoarius berenyi, Neoarius paucus, Neoarius pectoralis, and Neoarius aff. graeffei. DNA sequences of the eight species were obtained through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database, and the mitochondrial genomes were assembled using the NOVOplasty tool on the Galaxy platform, subsequently annotated with the MitoAnnotator tool. We then utilized the protein-coding genes from the mitogenomes to estimate the phylogenetic relationships within the group, including seven additional mitogenomes available in the NCBI. In all species, the mitochondrial genomes presented 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and 1 D-loop.},

@article{pinter_functional_2021,
 abstract = {The lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a pivotal role in cellular differentiation by regulating the expression of key developmental genes in concert with different coregulatory proteins. This process is impaired in different cancer types and incompletely understood. To comprehensively identify functional coregulators of LSD1, we established a novel tractable fluorescent reporter system to monitor LSD1 activity in living cells. Combining this reporter system with a state-of-the-art multiplexed RNAi screen, we identify the DEAD-box helicase 19A (DDX19A) as a novel coregulator and demonstrate that suppression of Ddx19a results in an increase of R-loops and reduced LSD1-mediated gene silencing. We further show that DDX19A binds to tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and it regulates gene expression through the removal of transcription promoting R-loops. Our results uncover a novel transcriptional regulatory cascade where the downregulation of genes is dependent on the LSD1 mediated demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). This allows the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to methylate H3K27, which serves as a binding site for DDX19A. Finally, the binding of DDX19A leads to the efficient removal of R-loops at active promoters, which further de-represses LSD1 and PRC2, establishing a positive feedback loop leading to a robust repression of the target gene.},

MaxQuant and MSstats in Galaxy can be applied in conjunction with thousands of existing Galaxy tools and integrated into standardized, sharable workflows. Galaxy tracks all metadata and intermediate results in analysis histories, which can be shared privately for collaborations or publicly, allowing full reproducibility and transparency of published analysis. To further increase accessibility, we provide detailed hands-on training materials. The integration of MaxQuant and MSstats into the Galaxy framework enables their usage in a reproducible way on accessible large computational infrastructures, hence realizing the foundation for high-throughput proteomics data science for everyone.},

 abstract = {Epidemiological surveillance of animal tuberculosis (TB) based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium bovis has recently gained track due to its high resolution to identify infection sources, characterize the pathogen population structure, and facilitate contact tracing. However, the workflow from bacterial isolation to sequence data analysis has several technical challenges that may severely impact the power to understand the epidemiological scenario and inform outbreak response. While trying to use archived DNA from cultured samples obtained during routine official surveillance of animal TB in Portugal, we struggled against three major challenges: the low amount of M. bovis DNA obtained from routinely processed animal samples; the lack of purity of M. bovis DNA, i.e., high levels of contamination with DNA from other organisms; and the co-occurrence of more than one M. bovis strain per sample (within-host mixed infection). The loss of isolated genomes generates missed links in transmission chain reconstruction, hampering the biological and epidemiological interpretation of data as a whole. Upon identification of these challenges, we implemented an integrated solution framework based on whole genome amplification and a dedicated computational pipeline to minimize their effects and recover as many genomes as possible. With the approaches described herein, we were able to recover 62 out of 100 samples that would have otherwise been lost. Based on these results, we discuss adjustments that should be made in official and research laboratories to facilitate the sequential implementation of bacteriological culture, PCR, downstream genomics, and computational-based methods. All of this in a time frame supporting data-driven intervention.},

 abstract = {In contrast to the many reports of successful real-world cases of personalized bacteriophage therapy (BT), randomized controlled trials of non-personalized bacteriophage products have not produced the expected results. Here we present the outcomes of a retrospective observational analysis of the first 100 consecutive cases of personalized BT of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium in 35 hospitals, 29 cities and 12 countries during the period from 1 January 2008 to 30 April 2022. We assessed how often personalized BT produced a positive clinical outcome (general efficacy) and performed a regression analysis to identify functional relationships. The most common indications were lower respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue, and bone infections, and involved combinations of 26 bacteriophages and 6 defined bacteriophage cocktails, individually selected and sometimes pre-adapted to target the causative bacterial pathogens. Clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported for 77.2\% and 61.3\% of infections, respectively. In our dataset of 100 cases, eradication was 70\% less probable when no concomitant antibiotics were used (odds ratio = 0.3; 95\% confidence interval = 0.127–0.749). In vivo selection of bacteriophage resistance and in vitro bacteriophage–antibiotic synergy were documented in 43.8\% (7/16 patients) and 90\% (9/10) of evaluated patients, respectively. We observed a combination of antibiotic re-sensitization and reduced virulence in bacteriophage-resistant bacterial isolates that emerged during BT. Bacteriophage immune neutralization was observed in 38.5\% (5/13) of screened patients. Fifteen adverse events were reported, including seven non-serious adverse drug reactions suspected to be linked to BT. While our analysis is limited by the uncontrolled nature of these data, it indicates that BT can be effective in combination with antibiotics and can inform the design of future controlled clinical trials.

@article{potgieter_metanovo_2023,
 abstract = {Background Microbiome research is providing important new insights into the metabolic interactions of complex microbial ecosystems involved in fields as diverse as the pathogenesis of human diseases, agriculture and climate change. Poor correlations typically observed between RNA and protein expression datasets make it hard to accurately infer microbial protein synthesis from metagenomic data. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic analyses typically rely on focused search sequence databases based on prior knowledge for protein identification that may not represent all the proteins present in a set of samples. Metagenomic 16S rRNA sequencing only targets the bacterial component, while whole genome sequencing is at best an indirect measure of expressed proteomes. Here we describe a novel approach, MetaNovo, that combines existing open-source software tools to perform scalable de novo sequence tag matching with a novel algorithm for probabilistic optimization of the entire UniProt knowledgebase to create tailored sequence databases for target-decoy searches directly at the proteome level, enabling metaproteomic analyses without prior expectation of sample composition or metagenomic data generation and compatible with standard downstream analysis pipelines. Results We compared MetaNovo to published results from the MetaPro-IQ pipeline on 8 human mucosal-luminal interface samples, with comparable numbers of peptide and protein identifications, many shared peptide sequences and a similar bacterial taxonomic distribution compared to that found using a matched metagenome sequence database—but simultaneously identified many more non-bacterial peptides than the previous approaches. MetaNovo was also benchmarked on samples of known microbial composition against matched metagenomic and whole genomic sequence database workflows, yielding many more MS/MS identifications for the expected taxa, with improved taxonomic representation, while also highlighting previously described genome sequencing quality concerns for one of the organisms, and identifying an experimental sample contaminant without prior expectation. Conclusions By estimating taxonomic and peptide level information directly on microbiome samples from tandem mass spectrometry data, MetaNovo enables the simultaneous identification of peptides from all domains of life in metaproteome samples, bypassing the need for curated sequence databases to search. We show that the MetaNovo approach to mass spectrometry metaproteomics is more accurate than current gold standard approaches of tailored or matched genomic sequence database searches, can identify sample contaminants without prior expectation and yields insights into previously unidentified metaproteomic signals, building on the potential for complex mass spectrometry metaproteomic data to speak for itself.},

@article{pustam_comparative_2023,
 abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae are closely related human pathogens of global concern. The more recently described K. quasipneumoniae shares similar morphological characteristics with K. pneumoniae and is commonly misidentified as this species using traditional laboratory techniques. The vast mobilome in these pathogenic bacteria influences the dissemination of virulence factors in high-risk environments and it is, therefore, critical to monitor strains for developing effective clinical management strategies. Herein, this study utilized Illumina sequencing to characterize the whole genomes of nine clinical K. pneumoniae and one K. quasipneumoniae isolate obtained from patients of 3 major hospitals in Trinidad, West Indies. Reconstruction of the assembled genomes and implementation of several bioinformatic tools revealed unique features such as high pathogenicity islands associated with the isolates. The K. pneumoniae isolates were categorized as classical (n = 3), uropathogenic (n = 5), or hypervirulent (n = 1) strains. In silico multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates were related to several international high-risk genotypes, including sequence types ST11, ST15, ST86, and ST307. Analysis of the virulome and mobilome of these pathogens showed unique and clinically important features including the presence of genes associated with Type 1 and Type 3 fimbriae, the aerobactin and yersiniabactin siderophore systems, the K2 and O1/2, and the O3 and O5 serotypes. These genes were either on or in close proximity to insertion sequence elements, phage sequences, and plasmids. Several secretion systems including the Type VI system and relevant effector proteins were prevalent in the local isolates. This is the first comprehensive study investigating the genomes of clinical K. pneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae isolates from Trinidad, West Indies. The data presented illustrate the diversity of Trinidadian clinical K. pneumoniae isolates as well as significant virulence biomarkers and mobile elements associated with these isolates. Additionally, the genomes of the local isolates will add to global databases and thus can be used in future surveillance or genomic studies in this country and the wider Caribbean region.},

 abstract = {Objectives
Antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is a human pathogen of major global concern due to its ability to cause multiple severe diseases that are often difficult to treat therapeutically. This study aimed to investigate the resistome of local clinical K. pneumoniae isolates.
Methods
Herein, we used a whole genome sequencing approach and bioinformatics tools to reconstruct the resistome of ten clinical K. pneumoniae isolates and one clinical isolate of the closely related Klebsiella quasipneumoniae obtained from patients from three major hospitals in Trinidad, West Indies.
Results
The results of the study revealed the presence of a complex antibiotic-resistant armory among the local isolates with multiple resistance mechanisms involving (i) inactivation of antibiotics, (ii) efflux pumps, (iii) antibiotic target alteration, protection, and replacement against antibiotics, and (iv) altered porin protein that reduced the permeability to antibiotics. Several resistance genes such as blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1B, blaSHV-28, blaKPC-2, oqxA, sul1, tetD, aac(6′)-Ib-cr5, aph(6)-Id, and fosA6, which are known to confer resistance to antibiotics used to treat K. pneumoniae infections. In most cases, the resistance genes were flanked by mobile elements, including insertion sequences and transposons, which facilitate the spread of these genetic features among related organisms.
Conclusion
This is the first comprehensive study to thoroughly investigate the resistome of clinical K. pneumoniae isolates and K. quasipneumoniae from Trinidad, West Indies. These findings suggest that monitoring K. pneumoniae and its genome-wide antibiotic resistance features in clinical strains would be of critical importance for guiding antibiotic stewardship programs and improving regional disease management systems for this pathogen.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Multicellular organisms coordinate tissue specific response to environmental information via both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. In addition to secreted ligands, secreted small RNAs have recently been reported to regulate gene expression across tissue boundaries. Here we show that the conserved poly-U specific endoribonuclease ENDU-2 is secreted from the soma and taken-up by the germline to ensure germline immortality at elevated temperature in C. elegans. ENDU-2 binds to mature mRNAs and negatively regulates mRNA abundance both in the soma and the germline. While ENDU-2 promotes RNA decay in the soma directly via its endoribonuclease activity, ENDU-2 prevents misexpression of soma-specific genes in the germline and preserves germline immortality independent of its RNA-cleavage activity. In summary, our results suggest that the secreted RNase ENDU-2 transmits environmental information across tissue boundaries and contributes to maintenance of stem cell immortality probably via retaining a stem cell specific program of gene expression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Tanshinone I and tanshinone IIB with anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidative, anti-neoplastic, neuron protective, and heart protective properties are valuable active components in it. However, the biosynthetic pathway of tanshinone IIB and tanshinone I has not been completely elucidated. Here, we identified a tanshinone IIA 19-hydroxylase from S. miltiorrhiza. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that SmCYP71D373 could hydroxylate tanshinone IIA at C-19 position to produce tanshinone IIB. Reaction conditions optimization demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of SmCYP71D373 was the highest using the substrate-feeding method under the following conditions, fed the tanshinone IIA into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing codon-optimized SmCYP71D373 at 28℃ for 24 hours. And the yield of tanshinone IIB was up to 6.38\%. Furthermore, N121 and S210 of SmCYP71D373 were verified as the key amino acid residues responsible for its catalytic activity for tanshinone IIA by molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis. The results not only lay a foundation for the elucidation of tanshinone I synthesis pathway, but also provide the theoretical support to improve the catalytic efficiency of SmCYP71D373 for tanshinone IIB production.},

Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting; many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples.

 abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus thrives at animal-human-environment interfaces. A large-scale work from our group indicated that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in commensal S. aureus strains from wild ungulates is associated with agricultural land cover and livestock farming, raising the hypothesis that AMR genes in wildlife strains may originate from different hosts, namely via exchange of mobile genetic elements (MGE). In this work, we generate the largest available dataset of S. aureus draft genomes from wild ungulates in Portugal and explore their mobilome, which can determine important traits such as AMR, virulence, and host specificity, to understand MGE exchange. Core genome multi-locus sequence typing based on 98 newly generated draft genomes and 101 publicly available genomes from Portugal demonstrated that the genomic relatedness of S. aureus from wild ungulates assigned to livestock-associated sequence types (ST) is greater compared to wild ungulate isolates assigned to human-associated STs. Screening of host specificity determinants disclosed the unexpected presence in wildlife of the immune evasion cluster encoded in φSa3 prophage, described as a human-specific virulence determinant. Additionally, two plasmids, pAVX and pETB, previously associated with avian species and humans, respectively, and the Tn553 transposon were detected. Both pETB and Tn553 encode penicillin resistance through blaZ. Pangenome analysis of wild ungulate isolates shows a core genome fraction of 2133 genes, with isolates assigned to ST72 and ST3224 being distinguished from the remaining by MGEs, although there is no reported role of these in adaptation to wildlife. AMR related gene clusters found in the shell genome are directly linked to resistance against penicillin, macrolides, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides, and they represent mobile ARGs. Altogether, our findings support epidemiological interactions of human and non-human hosts at interfaces, with MGE exchange, including AMR determinants, associated with putative indirect movements of S. aureus among human and wildlife hosts that might be bridged by livestock.},

 abstract = {Continuous vision loss due to vasoproliferative eye disease still represents an unsolved issue despite anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. The impact of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling on retinal angiogenesis and its potential use as a therapeutic target remain controversial. In vitro, oncostatin M (OSM), as a strong STAT3 activator, possesses robust proangiogenic activity. This study investigated to what extent the proangiogenic effects of OSM translate to the in vivo setting of vasoproliferative eye disease.    The in vitro effect of OSM on endothelial cells was investigated in the spheroid sprouting assay and through RNA sequencing. The mouse model for oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) was used to evaluate the impact of OSM in vivo. Signaling patterns were measured by western blot and retinal cryosections. Primary Müller cell cultures were used to evaluate the effect of OSM on the Müller cell secretome. Murine retinal vascular endothelial cells were isolated from OIR retinas using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and were used for RNA sequencing.    Although OSM induced pro-angiogenic responses in vitro, in the OIR model intravitreal injection of OSM reduced retinal neovascularization by 65.2\% and vaso-obliteration by 45.5\% in Müller cells. Injecting OSM into the vitreous activated the STAT3 signaling pathway in multiple retinal cell types, including Müller cells. In vitro, OSM treatment increased CXCL10 secretion. RNA sequencing of sorted vascular endothelial cells at OIR P17 following OSM treatment indicated downregulation of angiogenesis- and mitosis-associated genes.    In vivo, OSM reveals a beneficial angiomodulatory effect by activating Müller cells and changing their secretome. The data highlight contradictions between cytokine-induced effects in vitro and in vivo depending on the cell types mediating the effect.},

@article{rapp_stat3_2023,
 abstract = {Aberrant angiogenesis is a hallmark of cardiovascular and retinal neovascular disease. The STAT3 signaling pathway represents a potential pharmacological target for these diseases due to its impact on angiogenesis. Surprisingly, some STAT3 activators, such as the IL-6 cytokine family member oncostatin M (OSM), enhance angiogenesis, whereas others, such as ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), reduce it. This study aimed to clarify these conflicting effects. In contrast to the anti-angiogenic cytokine CNTF, the pro-angiogenic cytokine OSM was able to activate intracellular signaling pathways beyond the STAT3 pathway, including the ERK and AKT pathways. These differences translated into transcriptomic and metabolic shifts. siRNA-mediated STAT3 knockdown experiments showed a decrease in VEGF-induced endothelial migration and sprouting, enhancing the pro-angiogenic drive of OSM and switching the CNTF response from anti-angiogenic to pro-angiogenic. These effects correlated with a transcriptomic shift representing enhanced STAT1 and ERK activity following STAT3 knockdown, including a compensatory prolonged phosphorylated STAT1 activity. In conclusion, the angiogenic effect of STAT3 appears to be determined by cytokine-induced STAT3 specificity and simultaneous activity of other intracellular signaling pathways, whereas the STAT3 pathway, predominantly recognized for its pro-angiogenic phenotypes, reveals novel anti-angiogenic potential.},

@article{rasche_training_2020,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Hands-on training, whether it is in Bioinformatics or other scientific domains, requires significant resources and knowledge to setup and run. Trainers must have access to infrastructure that can support the sudden spike in usage, with classes of 30 or more trainees simultaneously running resource-intensive tools. For efficient classes, the jobs must run quickly, without queuing delays, lest they disrupt the timetable set out for the class. Often times this is achieved via running on a private server where there is no contention for the queue, and therefore no or minimal waiting time. However, this requires the teacher or trainer to have the technical knowledge to manage compute infrastructure, in addition to their didactic responsibilities. This presents significant burdens to potential training events, in terms of infrastructure cost, person-hours of preparation, technical knowledge, and available staff to manage such events. Findings: Galaxy Europe has developed Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS) which we provide to the scientific commnuity as a service built on top of the Galaxy Platform. Training event organisers request a training and Galaxy administrators can allocate private queues specifically for the training. Trainees are transparently placed in a private queue where their jobs run without delay. Trainers access the dashboard of the TIaaS Service and can remotely follow the progress of their trainees without in-person interactions. Conclusions: TIaaS on Galaxy Europe provides reusable and fast infrastructure for Galaxy training. The instructor dashboard provides visibility into class progress, making in-person trainings more efficient and remote training possible. In the past 24 months, \$\&gt;110\$ trainings with over 3000 trainees have used this infrastructure for training, across scientific domains, all enjoying the accessibility and reproducibility of Galaxy for training the next generation of bioinformaticians. TIaaS itself is an extension to Galaxy which can be deployed by any Galaxy administrator to provide similar benefits for their users. https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The latter are induced by signals from the microenvironment and rely on unique tissue-specific molecular programs requiring the combinatorial action of tissue-specific and broadly expressed transcriptional regulators. Here, we identify the transcription factors Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as novel regulators of alveolar macrophages (AMs)?a population that provides the first line of immune defense and executes homeostatic functions in lung alveoli. In the absence of these factors, AMs exhibited decreased proliferation that resulted in a severe disadvantage of knockout AMs in a competitive setting. Gene expression analyses revealed a broad cell-intrinsic footprint of Bhlhe40/Bhlhe41 deficiency manifested by a downregulation of AM signature genes and induction of signature genes of other macrophage lineages. Genome-wide characterization of Bhlhe40 DNA binding suggested that these transcription factors directly repress the expression of lineage-inappropriate genes in AMs. Taken together, these results identify Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as key regulators of AM self-renewal and guardians of their identity.},

@article{rauschmeier_cell-intrinsic_2021,
 abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}ABSTRACT{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The generation of high-affinity antibodies against pathogens and vaccines requires the germinal center (GC) reaction – a process that relies on a complex interplay between specialized effector subsets of B and CD4 T lymphocytes – GC B cells and T follicular helper (T$_{\textrm{FH}}$) cells. Intriguingly, several key positive regulators of the GC reaction are common for both cell types. Here, we report that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 is a crucial cell-intrinsic negative regulator affecting both the B and T cell sides of the GC reaction. In activated CD4 T cells, Bhlhe40 was required to restrain proliferation thus limiting the number of T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells. In B cells, Bhlhe40 executed its function in the first days after immunization by selectively restricting the generation of the earliest GC B cells but not of early memory B cells or plasmablasts. Conditional Bhlhe40 inactivation confirmed cell-autonomous functions of Bhlhe40 in both GC B and T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells, while the GC phenotype was further enhanced upon loss of Bhlhe40 in both cell types. This negative regulation of the GC reaction by Bhlhe40 was of crucial importance, as Bhlhe40-deficient mice with progressing age succumbed to a B cell lymphoma characterized by accumulation of monoclonal GC B-like cells and polyclonal T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells in various tissues.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@phdthesis{rehm_analyse_2023,
 abstract = {Humane Papillomviren (HPV) infizieren Keratinozyten der Haut- und Schleimhaut. Die Hochrisiko-Typen (HR) der alpha-Gattung verursachen dadurch anogenitalen- und oropharyngalen-Krebs. Vorherrschend dabei ist das Zervixkarzinom, welches zu 70 \% von HPV16 und HPV18 ausgelöst wird. Im Gegensatz dazu sind die onkogenen Eigenschaften der beta-HPV Gattung weniger gut erforscht. Bei Patienten mit der seltenen Erbkrankheit Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV) und Organtransplantatempfängern (OTRs) wird ein Zusammenhang zwischen beta-HPV-Infektionen und der Entstehung von kutanen Plattenepithelkarzinomen vermutet. Bisher wurden die Eigenschaften von beta-HPV vor allem durch retrovirale Expression der E6 und E7 Onkogene in Keratinozyten, durch Transfektion der Osteosarkomzelllinie U2OS mit beta-HPV Genomen und in transgenen Mausmodellen untersucht, aber nicht mit vollständigen viralen Genomen in normalen humanen Keratinozyten (NHK), den natürlichen Zielzellen. Im Rahmen meiner Dissertation konnte ich zeigen, dass HPV8-, 38- und 49-Genome in humanen Keratinozyten mindestens neun Tage lang transkriptionell aktiv sind und replizieren. Durch Inaktivierung des viralen E8{\textasciicircum}E2 Repressors (E8-/E8{\textasciicircum}E2-) erhält das HPV49 Genom die Fähigkeit NHK zu immortalisieren. Die immortalisierten HPV49 E8- Zelllinien enthalten große Mengen an episomalen Virusgenomen und viralen Transkripten und behalten diese in Kultur über einen langen Zeitraum. Nicht nur der Verlust der E6 und E7 Onkogene, sondern auch eine Inaktivierung der E1 oder E2 Replikationsgene verhindern die Immortalisierung. Die E8-/E1- und E8-/E2- Genome zeigen deutlich niedrigere E6 und E7 Transkriptmengen in transienten Experimenten. Dies legt nahe, dass für die Immortalisierung eine starke E6 und E7 Expression von extrachromosomalen Virusgenomen erforderlich ist. Die Notwendigkeit für eine Inaktivierung von E8 im Kontext von intakten E1 und E2 Genen für die Immortalisierung von NHK zeigt, dass E8{\textasciicircum}E2 eine wichtige Rolle bei der Kontrolle der Onkogenität von beta-HPV spielen könnte, und weist auf grundlegende Unterschiede zwischen HPV49 und HR-HPV Genomen hin. 
Durch RNA-Sequenzierung der HPV49 E8- positiven Zelllinien konnten bekannte Spleißverknüpfungen bestätigt, das frühe Polyadenylierungssignal lokalisiert und Hinweise auf unterschiedliche virale Promotoren erhalten werden. Außerdem wurden neue Spleißverbindungen kartiert und ein neuer Spleißdonor im E6 Gen funktionell untersucht. Dieser beeinflusst die Menge an E6 Protein und vermutlich dadurch die Immortalisierung durch das HPV49 E8- Genom. 
Bei HPV8 und 38 konnten auch durch Inaktivierung von E8{\textasciicircum}E2 keine immortalisierten Zelllinien erzeugt werden, obwohl ähnliche Mengen an Transkripten für die E6 und E7 Onkogene wie bei HPV49 E8- Genomen transkribiert wurden. Dies legt nahe, dass beta-HPV Genome unterschiedliche onkogene Eigenschaften besitzen. Die Inaktivierung der Replikationsgene E1 und E2 reduzierte die Transkription aller untersuchten beta-HPV in NHK, was nahelegt, dass auch WT Genome aktiv replizieren. Die Kultivierung von HPV8- oder 38-transfizierten NHKs in organotypischen Modellen, die die Analyse des produktiven Replikationszyklus von HR-HPV ermöglichen, induziert Transkripte für das L1 Kapsidgen, was nahelegt, dass der produktive Lebenszyklus eingeleitet wurde. Außerdem ähnelt das HPV8-Transkriptionsmuster in organotypischen Kulturen dem einer HPV8-positiven EV-Läsion. 
Zusammengefasst bedeutet dies, dass NHK ein physiologisch relevantes System sind, um die Replikation und onkogenen Eigenschaften von beta-HPV zu untersuchen.},

Some cacao pathogens are restricted to specific regions of the world, such as the Cacao swollen shoot virus (CSSV) in West African countries, while others are expanding geographically, such as Moniliophthora roreri in the Americas. M. roreri is one of the most threatening cacao pathogens since it directly attacks the cacao pods driving a significant reduction in production, and therefore economic losses. Despite its importance, the knowledge about the microenvironment of this pathogen and the cocoa pods is still poorly characterized.MethodsHerein we performed RNA sequencing of spores in differential stages of culture in a medium supplemented with cacao pod extract and mycelium collected of the susceptible variety ICT 7121 naturally infected by the pathogen to evaluate the diversity and transcriptional activity of microorganisms associated with the in vitro sporulation of M. roreri.ResultsOur data revealed a great variety of fungi and bacteria associated with M. roreri, with an exceptional diversity of individuals from the genus Trichoderma sp. Interestingly, the dynamics of microorganisms from different kingdoms varied proportionally, suggesting they are somehow affected by M. roreri culture time. We also identified three sequences similar to viral genomes from the Narnaviridae family, posteriorly confirmed by phylogenetic analysis as members of the genus Narnavirus. Screening of M. roreri public datasets indicated the virus sequences circulating in samples from Ecuador, suggesting a wide spread of these elements. Of note, we did not identify traces of the viral sequences in the M. roreri genome or DNA sequencing, restricting the possibility of these sequences representing endogenized elements.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of viruses infecting the fungus of the genus Moniliophthora and only the third description of viruses that are able to parasite elements from the Marasmiaceae family.},

Here, we use the panel of single, double and triple mutants for zebrafish genome activators Pou5f3, Sox19b and Nanog, multi-omics and mathematical modeling to investigate the combinatorial mechanisms of genome activation. We show that Pou5f3 and Nanog act differently on synergistic and antagonistic enhancer types. Pou5f3 and Nanog both bind as pioneer-like TFs on synergistic enhancers, promote histone acetylation and activate transcription. Antagonistic enhancers are activated by binding of one of these factors. The other TF binds as non-pioneer-like TF, competes with the activator and blocks all its effects, partially or completely. This activator-blocker mechanism mutually restricts widespread transcriptional activation by Pou5f3 and Nanog and prevents premature expression of late developmental regulators in the early embryo.},

Carbohydrate metabolism was unexpectedly limited, and instead a key activity was metabolism of extractives. Resin acid degradation was principally linked to community diversification with specific bacteria revealed to dominate the process. Metagenome-guided isolation facilitated the recovery of the dominant enrichment strain in pure culture, which represents a new species (Pseudomonas abieticivorans sp. nov.), that can grow on resin acids as a sole carbon source. Our results illuminate key stages in degradation of an abundant renewable resource, and how defensive extractive compounds have major roles in shaping microbiomes.},

Transcriptomic analysis of a new conditionally sterile bhlh89,91 double mutant shows differential regulation of genes related to sexual reproduction, hormone signal transduction, and lipid storage and metabolism under low light. Here we have shown that bHLH89 and bHLH91 play a role in regulating fertility in response to light, suggesting that they function in mitigating environmental variation to ensure fertility is maintained under environmental stress.},

 abstract = {Glomerular disease due to podocyte malfunction is a major factor in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease. Identification of podocyte-specific signaling pathways is therefore a prerequisite to characterizing relevant disease pathways and developing novel treatment approaches. Here, we employed loss of function studies for EPB41L5 (Yurt) as a central podocyte gene to generate a cell type-specific disease model. Loss of Yurt in fly nephrocytes caused protein uptake and slit diaphragm defects. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of human EPB41L5 knockout podocytes demonstrated impaired mechanotransduction via the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway. Further analysis of specific inhibition of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcription factor complex by TEADi led to the identification of ARGHAP29 as an EPB41L5 and YAP/TAZ-dependently expressed podocyte RhoGAP. Knockdown of ARHGAP29 caused increased RhoA activation, defective lamellipodia formation, and increased maturation of integrin adhesion complexes, explaining similar phenotypes caused by loss of EPB41L5 and TEADi expression in podocytes. Detection of increased levels of ARHGAP29 in early disease stages of human glomerular disease implies a novel negative feedback loop for mechanotransductive RhoA—YAP/TAZ signaling in podocyte physiology and disease.},

In quiescent cells, these ULDs may be responsible for pre-integrative latency. However, their detection remains difficult due to the lack of specificity and sensitivity of existing techniques. We developed an ultra-sensitive, specific, and high-throughput technology for ULD quantification called DUSQ (DNA ultra-sensitive quantification) combining linker-mediated PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) using molecular barcodes. Studying cells with different activity levels, we determined that the ULD half-life goes up to 11 days in resting CD4+ T cells. Finally, we were able to quantify ULDs in samples from patients infected with HIV-1, providing a proof of concept for the use of DUSQ in vivo to track pre-integrative latency. DUSQ can be adapted to the detection of other rare DNA molecules.},

Our concatenated COI+28S phylogeny places the two New Caledonia species as a new branch within Boeckella, distinct from the branches consisting of South American, Antarctic and Australasian species. All 13 Boeckella populations inhabit the extreme south of New Caledonia, an area known for endemism and high heavy metal concentrations in the soil. Extensive mining activity in this metal-rich area, begun in 1873, is now leading to conflict with conservation goals. By using aerial photographs to trace the fate of the pond that is the type locality of B. spinogibba, we confirmed that it disappeared between 2007 and 2014 as a result of the expansion of the Goro nickel mine.},

@article{sabala_carbapenem_2024,
 abstract = {Background
Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a great public health problem and is associated with many disease outbreaks and high mortality rates. Alarmingly, K. pneumoniae has been isolated from food in several recent studies. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of CRKP in food samples from Egypt.
Methods
A total of 311 food samples (including 116 minced meat, 92 chicken meat, 75 diced meat, and 28 mutton) were collected from local markets in Egypt and were screened for CRKP with the determination of their antimicrobial resistance profiles. The whole genome sequence was done for 23 CRKP isolates to clarify the relationship between CRKP from food and human cases in Egypt using the SNP core genome. The conjugation probability of the blaNDM-5 harboring plasmid was identified using oriTfinder
Results
CRKP was isolated from 11\% (35/311) of the samples, with 45.71\% (16/35) of them showing resistance to colistin, one of the last-resort options for treating CRKP-mediated infections. In addition to the carbapenem and colistin resistance, the CRKP isolates frequently exhibited resistance to multiple antimicrobials including β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol. In addition, most of the CRKP were potentially hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (HvKP) identified as phylogroup Kp1 and of high-risk groups as detected in STs reported in many human outbreaks globally, such as ST383 and ST147. The core-genome phylogeny showed similarities between the isolates from this study and those previously isolated from clinical human samples in Egypt. In addition, analysis of the plasmid on which blaNDM is encoded revealed that several antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaOXA-9, blaCTX-M-15, aac(6′)-Ib, qnrS1, and several virulence genes are encoded on the same plasmid.
Conclusions
This study is significant for food safety and public health and is important to further identify the change in the epidemiology of CRKP infections, especially the consumption of contaminated food products.},

 abstract = {Introduction: MicroRNAs have a significant role in the regulation of the transcriptome. Several miRNAs have been proposed as potential biomarkers in different malignancies. However, contradictory results have been reported on the capability of miRNA biomarkers in cancer detection. The human biological clock involves molecular mechanisms that regulate several genes over time. Therefore, the sampling time becomes one of the significant factors in gene expression studies.Method: In the present study, we have tried to find miRNAs with minimum fluctuation in expression levels at different time points that could be more accurate candidates as diagnostic biomarkers. The small RNA-seq raw data of ten healthy individuals across nine-time points were analyzed to identify miRNAs with stable expression.Results: We have found five oscillation patterns. The stable miRNAs were investigated in 779 small-RNA-seq datasets of eleven cancer types. All miRNAs with the highest differential expression were selected for further analysis. The selected miRNAs were explored for functional pathways. The predominantly enriched pathways were miRNA in cancer and the P53-signaling pathway. Finally, we have found seven miRNAs, including miR-142-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-223-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-148b-3p, miR-340-5p, and miR-421. These miRNAs showed minimum fluctuation in healthy blood and were dysregulated in the blood of eleven cancer types. Conclusion: We have found a signature of seven stable miRNAs which dysregulate in several cancer types and may serve as potential pan-cancer biomarkers.},

@phdthesis{sabrina_statistical_2020,
 abstract = {Protein-RNA interactions play an important role in all post-transcriptional regulatory processes. High throughput detection of protein-RNA interactions has been facilitated by the emerging CLIP-seq (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing) techniques. Enrichments in mapped reads as well as base transitions or deletions at crosslink sites can be used to infer binding regions. Single-nucleotide resolution techniques (iCLIP and eCLIP) have been achieved by capturing high fractions of cDNAs which are truncated at protein-RNA crosslink sites. Increasing numbers of datasets and derivatives of these protocols have been published in recent years, requiring tailored computational analyses. Existing methods unfortunately do not explicitly model the specifics of truncation patterns and possible biases caused by background binding or crosslinking sequence preferences. 
We present PureCLIP, a hidden Markov model based approach, which simultaneously performs peak calling and individual crosslink site detection. It is capable of incorporating external data to correct for non-specific background signals and, for the first time, for the crosslinking biases. We devised a comprehensive evaluation based on three strategies. Firstly, we developed a workflow to simulate iCLIP data, which starts from real RNA-seq data and known binding regions and then mimics the experimental steps of the iCLIP protocol, including the generation of background signals. Secondly, we used experimental iCLIP and eCLIP datasets, using the proteins’ known predominant binding regions. And thirdly, we assessed the agreement of called sites between replicates, assuming target-specific signals are reproducible between replicates. 
On both simulated and real data, PureCLIP is consistently more precise in calling crosslink sites than other state-of-the-art methods. In particular when incorporating input control data and crosslink associated motifs (CL-motifs) PureCLIP is up to 13\% more precise than other methods and we show that it has an up to 20\% higher agreement across replicates. Moreover, our method can optionally merge called crosslink sites to binding regions based on their distance and we show that the resulting regions reflect the known binding regions with high-resolution. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method achieves a high precision robustly over a range of different settings and performs well for proteins with different binding characteristics. Lastly, we extended the method to include individual CLIP replicates and show that this can boost the precision even further. PureCLIP and its documenta- tion are publicly available at https://github.com/skrakau/PureCLIP.},

An IncC plasmid carrying the blaNDM-1 gene also carried the rare rmtC gene, encoding for 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16RMTases), conferring resistance to all aminoglycosides. The global spread of New Delhi metallo (NDM) variants and their association with the 16RMTases among K. pneumoniae complete genomes available in GenBank was studied, and a complete overview of the association of 16RMTases and NDM in K. pneumoniae genomics was produced. NDM is often associated with16RMTases, and both are spreading in K. pneumoniae, conferring resistance to all beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.

To continue our previous studies, we confirmed that the Kro-0 allele of DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 3B causes stunted shoot growth in the BG-5 background. We also found that shoot growth repression was most pronounced near the apex at a lower temperature and that the cells in the hybrid stem failed to elongate correctly. Furthermore, we observed that shoot growth repression in hybrids depended on light availability. Global gene expression analysis indicated the involvement of hormones, especially strigolactone, associated with the dwarf phenotype.

 abstract = {To gain a thorough appreciation of microbiome dynamics, researchers characterize the functional relevance of expressed microbial genes or proteins. This can be accomplished through metaproteomics, which characterizes the protein expression of microbiomes. Several software tools exist for analyzing microbiomes at the functional level by measuring their combined proteome-level response to environmental perturbations. In this survey, we explore the performance of six available tools, to enable researchers to make informed decisions regarding software choice based on their research goals. Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from dental caries plaque samples grown with and without sucrose in paired biofilm reactors were used as representative data for this evaluation. Microbial peptides from one sample pair were identified by the X! tandem search algorithm via SearchGUI and subjected to functional analysis using software tools including eggNOG-mapper, MEGAN5, MetaGOmics, MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA), ProPHAnE, and Unipept to generate functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Among these software tools, notable differences in functional annotation were detected after comparing differentially expressed protein functional groups. Based on the generated GO terms of these tools we performed a peptide-level comparison to evaluate the quality of their functional annotations. A BLAST analysis against the NCBI non-redundant database revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of functional annotation varied between tools. For example, eggNOG-mapper mapped to the most number of GO terms, while Unipept generated more accurate GO terms. Based on our evaluation, metaproteomics researchers can choose the software according to their analytical needs and developers can use the resulting feedback to further optimize their algorithms. To make more of these tools accessible via scalable metaproteomics workflows, eggNOG-mapper and Unipept 4.0 were incorporated into the Galaxy platform.},

Using RNAseq of MS brains, we discovered differential expression and aberrant splicing of hnRNP A1 target RNAs involved in neuronal function and RNA homeostasis. We confirmed this in vivo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis employing CLIPseq specific for hnRNP A1, where hnRNP A1 differentially binds and regulates RNA, including aberrantly spliced targets identified in human samples. Additionally, dysfunctional hnRNP A1 expression in neurons caused neurite loss and identical changes in splicing, corroborating hnRNP A1 dysfunction as a cause of neurodegeneration.

@article{sanchez-leon_heteroresistance_2023,
 abstract = {Heteroresistance to colistin can be defined as the presence of resistant subpopulations in an isolate that is susceptible to this antibiotic. Colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is more frequently related to chromosomal mutations and insertions. This work aimed to study heteroresistance in nine clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing OXA-48 and to describe genomic changes in mutants with acquired resistance in vitro. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution (BMD) and heteroresistance by population analysis profiling (PAP). The proteins related to colistin resistance were analyzed for the presence of mutations. Additionally, PCR of the mgrB gene was performed to identify the presence of insertions. In the nine parental isolates, the PAP method showed colistin heteroresistance of colonies growing on plates with concentrations of up to 64 mg/L, corresponding to stable mutant subpopulations. The MICs of some mutants from the PAP plate containing 4×MIC of colistin had absolute values of ≤2 mg/L that were higher than the parental MICs and were defined as persistent variants. PCR of the mgrB gene identified an insertion sequence that inactivated the gene in 21 mutants. Other substitutions in the investigated mutants were found in PhoP, PhoQ, PmrB, PmrC, CrrA and CrrB proteins. Colistin heteroresistance in K. pneumoniae isolates was attributed mainly to insertions in the mgrB gene and point mutations in colistin resistance proteins. The results of this study will improve understanding regarding the mechanisms of colistin resistance in mutants of K. pneumoniae producing OXA-48.},

BKS candidates were detected based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence using the Next Generation Sequencing method. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing data were obtained from DNA isolated from peat soil of the secondary forest (SF), acacia plantations (AP), and rubber plantations (RP) in the Giam Siak Kecil - Bukit Batu (GSK-BB) Biosphere Reserve, Riau. The natural vegetation of peat swamp forest dominates the SF, which was relatively heterogeneous with anaerobic conditions and water level at 60-120 cm. The RP locations were planted with 6-7 year old rubber, water level was 20 cm, and the garden was not maintained. The AP locations were planted with A. crassicarpa and peat thickness was 9 m. The peat soil was sampled in August 2019. BKS candidates were selected based on a phylogenetic tree using MEGA 6.06 by observing the grouping of DNA sequences obtained only from secondary forests. Furthermore, the selection was also conducted using BLASTn: Align Two or More Sequence analysis to determine the similarity between selected BKS candidates. Based on the detected BKS candidate, a specific primer was designed to amplify the BKS sequence, and the specificity was tested in silico with FastPCR to detect that the primer was only for the amplification of the BKS target. Two BKS candidates with the same sequence length of 455 bp were discovered in the secondary forests and there were successfully amplified by 2 pairs of specific primers. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two BKS candidates could be used to monitor the peat quality that has been converted into plantation areas molecularly.},

In the context of epithelial ovarian cancer, a highly heterogeneous disease with diverse subtypes, it is paramount to study a wide panel of models in order to draw a representative picture of the disease. As this lethal gynaecological malignancy has seen little improvement in overall survival in the last decade, it is all the more pressing to support future research with robust and diverse study models. Here, we describe ten novel spontaneously immortalized patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines, detailing their respective mutational profiles and gene/biomarker expression patterns, as well as their in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics. Eight of the cell lines were classified as high-grade serous, while two were determined to be of the rarer mucinous and clear cell subtypes, respectively. Each of the ten cell lines presents a panel of characteristics reflective of diverse clinically relevant phenomena, including chemotherapeutic resistance, metastatic potential, and subtype-associated mutations and gene/protein expression profiles. Importantly, four cell lines formed subcutaneous tumors in mice, a key characteristic for pre-clinical drug testing. Our work thus contributes significantly to the available models for the study of ovarian cancer, supplying additional tools to better understand this complex disease.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have deciphered the transcriptional profile of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in body donor eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and were thus limited by the time span from death to preservation and the associated 5'-RNA degradation. Therefore, this study used CNV and control specimens which had been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded immediately after surgical extraction and analyzed them using a 3’ RNA sequencing approach. Transcriptome profiles were analyzed and used to estimate content of immune and stromal cells and to define disease-associated gene signatures using statistical and bioinformatic methods. We identified 158 differentially-expressed genes (DEG) that were significantly increased in CNV compared to control tissue. Cell type enrichment analysis revealed a diverse cellular landscape with an enrichment of immune and stroma cell types in CNV including endothelial cells, macrophages, T cells and NKT cells. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that DEG contributed to Blood Vessel Development, Extracellular Structure Organization, Response to Wounding and several immune-related terms. The S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) and S100A9 emerged among the top DEG, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry on CNV tissue and protein analysis of vitreous samples. This study provides a high-resolution RNA-sequencing-based transcriptional signature of human CNV, characterizes its compositional pattern of immune and stromal cells and reveals S100A8/A9 as a novel biomarker and promising target for AMD-directed therapeutics and diagnostics.},

 abstract = {Bioimage data are generated in diverse research fields throughout the life and biomedical sciences. Its potential for advancing scientific progress via modern, data-driven discovery approaches reaches beyond disciplinary borders. To fully exploit this potential, it is necessary to make bioimaging data, in general, multidimensional microscopy images and image series, FAIR, that is, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. These FAIR principles for research data management are now widely accepted in the scientific community and have been adopted by funding agencies, policymakers and publishers. To remain competitive and at the forefront of research, implementing the FAIR principles into daily routines is an essential but challenging task for researchers and research infrastructures. Imaging core facilities, well-established providers of access to imaging equipment and expertise, are in an excellent position to lead this transformation in bioimaging research data management. They are positioned at the intersection of research groups, IT infrastructure providers, the institution´s administration, and microscope vendors. In the frame of German BioImaging – Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis (GerBI-GMB), cross-institutional working groups and third-party funded projects were initiated in recent years to advance the bioimaging community's capability and capacity for FAIR bioimage data management. Here, we provide an imaging-core-facility-centric perspective outlining the experience and current strategies in Germany to facilitate the practical adoption of the FAIR principles closely aligned with the international bioimaging community. We highlight which tools and services are ready to be implemented and what the future directions for FAIR bioimage data have to offer.},

To gain insights into tumorigenesis and molecular profiles of these tumors, and to ultimately suggest alternative treatment options, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model by breeding hGFAP-cre::Trp53Fl/Fl::lsl-MYCN mice. All mice developed aggressive forebrain tumors early in their lifetime that mimic human HGG-MYCN regarding histology, DNA methylation, and gene expression. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a high intratumoral heterogeneity with neuronal and oligodendroglial lineage signatures.

Because of their critical roles, G4s are potential antiviral targets, yet their function remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize the formation and functions of a conserved G4 within the polymerase coding region of orthoflaviviruses of the Flaviviridae family. Using yellow fever virus, we determine that this G4 promotes viral replication and suppresses host stress responses via interactions with hnRNPH1, a host nuclear protein involved in RNA processing. G4 binding to hnRNPH1 causes its cytoplasmic retention with subsequent impacts on G4-containing tRNA fragments (tiRNAs) involved in stress-mediated reductions in translation. As a result, these host stress responses and associated antiviral effects are impaired. These data reveal that the interplay between hnRNPH1 and both host and viral G4 targets controls the integrated stress response and viral replication.},

When we mimicked an early systemic viral infection or applied murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) systemically in neonatal female and male mice, only male adolescent mice presented behavioral deficits, including reduced social behavior and cognition. This was paralleled by an increased amount of infiltrating T cells in the brain parenchyma, enhanced interferon-γ (IFNγ) signaling, and epigenetic reprogramming of microglial cells. These microglial cells showed increased phagocytic activity, which resulted in abnormal loss of excitatory synapses within the hippocampal brain region. None of these alterations were seen in female adolescent mice. Our findings underscore the early postnatal period’s susceptibility to cause sex-dependent long-term CNS deficiencies following infections.},

Although the interactions of some plant hormones (abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, and ethylene) with the glutathione s-transferase (GST) enzyme, which is one of the antioxidant enzymes, have already been reported, the influence of gibberellic acid (GA3) on this enzyme under saline conditions has not yet been reported. Plant material for the experiments was obtained from M14G144 cultivar of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown as a soil culture in growth chambers at 22 °C, 65–70\% moisture, 16-h light/8-h dark conditions, and with full strength Hoagland solution for 8 days under controlled growth conditions. Then, the plants were exposed to salt stress (350 mM NaCl and 100, 300, and 500 ppm GA3) simultaneously. In maize leaves, GA3 treatment alleviated the physiological parameters under salt stress. Specifically, the treatments with 100 and 500 ppm of GA3 were able to trigger GST enzyme and isoenzyme activities as well as hydrogen sulfide accumulation and anthocyanin content, although the lowest malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide radical content were under the treatment of 300 ppm of GA3. Besides this, GST gene expression levels were found to be upregulated between 1.5 and fourfold higher in all the plants treated with GA3 at different concentrations in proportion to salt stress. These results first indicated that the reason for the changes in GA3-treated plants was the stimulating role of this hormone to maintain GST regulation in maize plants.},

The inefficacy of traditional antibiotic drugs could be surmounted through the exploitation of natural bioactive compounds of which medicinal plants are a great reservoir. The finding that bacteria living inside plant tissues, (i.e., the endophytic bacterial microbiome) can influence the synthesis of the aforementioned compounds leads to the necessity of unraveling the mechanisms involved in the determination of this symbiotic relationship. Here, we report the genome sequence of four endophytic bacterial strains isolated from the medicinal plant Origanum vulgare L. and able to antagonize the growth of opportunistic pathogens of cystic fibrosis patients. The in silico analysis revealed the presence of gene clusters involved in the production of antimicrobial compounds, such as paeninodin, paenilarvins, polymyxin, and paenicidin A. Endophytes’ adaptation to the plant microenvironment was evaluated through the analysis of the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the four genomes. The diesel fuel degrading potential was also tested. Strains grew in minimum media supplemented with diesel fuel, but no n-alkanes degradation genes were found in their genomes, suggesting that diesel fuel degradation might occur through other steps involving enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of aromatic compounds.},

 abstract = {Medicinal plants play an important role in the discovery of new bioactive compounds with antimicrobial activity, thanks to their pharmacological properties. However, members of their microbiota can also synthesize bioactive molecules. Among these, strains belonging to the genera Arthrobacter are commonly found associated with the plant’s microenvironments, showing plant growth-promoting (PGP) activity and bioremediation properties. However, their role as antimicrobial secondary metabolite producers has not been fully explored. The aim of this work was to characterize the Arthrobacter sp. OVS8 endophytic strain, isolated from the medicinal plant Origanum vulgare L., from molecular and phenotypic viewpoints to evaluate its adaptation and influence on the plant internal microenvironments and its potential as a producer of antibacterial volatile molecules (VOCs). Results obtained from the phenotypic and genomic characterization highlight its ability to produce volatile antimicrobials effective against multidrug-resistant (MDR) human pathogens and its putative PGP role as a producer of siderophores and degrader of organic and inorganic pollutants. The outcomes presented in this work identify Arthrobacter sp. OVS8 as an excellent starting point toward the exploitation of bacterial endophytes as antibiotics sources.},

 abstract = {Tea, a widely consumed aromatic beverage, is often adulterated with dyes such as Bismarck brown Y (C.I. 21000) (BBY), Prussian blue, and Plumbago, which pose potential health risks. The objective of this study is to analyze how the food dye BBY interacts with serum protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). This study investigated the BBY-BSA interaction at the molecular level. Fluorescence spectroscopy results showed that the quenching of BSA by BBY is carried out by dynamic quenching mechanism. The displacement assay and molecular docking studies revealed that BBY binds at the flavanone binding site of BSA with hydrophobic interactions. Circular Dichroism results indicate the structural stability of the protein upon BBY binding. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of the complex in a dynamic solvent system, and quantum mechanics calculations showed slight conformational changes of the diaminophenyl ring due to increased hydrophobic interaction. The energetics of gas phase optimized and stable MD structures of BBY indicated similar values which further confirmed that the conformational changes were minor, and it also exhibited a moderate binding with BSA as shown by the MM/PBSA results. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular-level interactions between BBY and BSA, emphasizing the critical role of hydrophobic interactions.},

Nonetheless, recent studies suggest their significant impact on splicing, RNA stability, RNA folding, translation or co-translational protein folding. Hence, we compile 659194 synonymous mutations found in human cancer and characterize their properties. We provide the user-friendly, comprehensive resource for synonymous mutations in cancer, SynMICdb (http://SynMICdb.dkfz.de), which also contains orthogonal information about gene annotation, recurrence, mutation loads, cancer association, conservation, alternative events, impact on mRNA structure and a SynMICdb score. Notably, synonymous and missense mutations are depleted at the 5'-end of the coding sequence as well as at the ends of internal exons independent of mutational signatures. For patient-derived synonymous mutations in the oncogene KRAS, we indicate that single point mutations can have a relevant impact on expression as well as on mRNA secondary structure., Synonymous mutations do not alter amino acid sequence but may exert oncogenic effects in other ways.

 abstract = {The oomycete Pythium oligandrum is a potential biocontrol agent to control a wide range of fungal and oomycete-caused diseases, such as Pythium myriotylum-caused rhizome rot in ginger, leading to reduced yields and compromised quality. Previously, P. oligandrum has been studied for its plant growth-promoting potential by auxin production and induction of disease resistance by elicitors such as oligandrin. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play beneficial roles in sustainable agriculture by enhancing plant growth and resistance. We investigated the contribution of P. oligandrum-produced VOCs on plant growth and disease suppression by initially using Nicotiana benthamiana plants for screening. P. oligandrum VOCs significantly enhanced tobacco seedling and plant biomass contents. Screening of the individual VOCs showed that 3-octanone and hexadecane promoted the growth of tobacco seedlings. The total VOCs from P. oligandrum also enhanced the shoot and root growth of ginger plants. Transcriptomic analysis showed a higher expression of genes related to plant growth hormones and stress responses in the leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. The concentrations of plant growth hormones such as auxin, zeatin, and gibberellic acid were higher in the leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. In a ginger disease biocontrol assay, the VOC-exposed ginger plants infected with P. myriotylum had lower levels of disease severity. We conclude that this study contributes to understanding the growth-promoting mechanisms of P. oligandrum on ginger and tobacco, priming of ginger plants against various stresses, and the mechanisms of action of P. oligandrum as a biocontrol agent.
IMPORTANCE Plant growth promotion plays a vital role in enhancing production of agricultural crops, and Pythium oligandrum is known for its plant growth-promoting potential through production of auxins and induction of resistance by elicitors. This study highlights the significance of P. oligandrum-produced VOCs in plant growth promotion and disease resistance. Transcriptomic analyses of leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs revealed the upregulation of genes involved in plant growth hormone signaling and stress responses. Moreover, the concentration of growth hormones significantly increased in P. oligandrum VOC-exposed ginger plants. Additionally, the disease severity was reduced in P. myriotylum-infected ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. In ginger, P. myriotylum-caused rhizome rot disease results in severe losses, and biocontrol has a role as part of an integrated pest management strategy for rhizome rot disease. Overall, growth enhancement and disease reduction in plants exposed to P. oligandrum-produced VOCs contribute to its role as a biocontrol agent.},

 abstract = {Background
Ischemia of the bile duct is a common feature in liver disease and transplantation, which represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially after liver transplantation. Detailed knowledge of its pathogenesis remains incomplete due to the lack of appropriate in vitro models.
Methods
To recapitulate biliary damage induced by ischemia and reperfusion in vitro, human intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ICOs) were grown at low oxygen levels of 1\% up to 72 h, followed by re-oxygenation at normal levels.
Findings
ICOs stressed by ischemia and subsequent re-oxygenation represented the dynamic change in biliary cell proliferation, upregulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated markers, and the evocation of phase-dependent cell death programs similar to what is described in patients. Clinical-grade alpha-1 antitrypsin was identified as a potent inhibitor of both ischemia-induced apoptosis and necroptosis.
Interpretation
These findings demonstrate that ICOs recapitulate ischemic cholangiopathy in vitro and enable drug assessment studies for the discovery of new therapeutics for ischemic cholangiopathies.

 abstract = {The single curative measure for heart failure patients is a heart transplantation, which is limited due to a shortage of donors, the need for immunosuppression and economic costs. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for identifying cell populations capable of cardiac regeneration that we will be able to trace and monitor. Injury to the adult mammalian cardiac muscle, often leads to a heart attack through the irreversible loss of a large number of cardiomyocytes, due to an idle regenerative capability. Recent reports in zebrafish indicate that Tbx5a is a vital transcription factor for cardiomyocyte regeneration. Preclinical data underscore the cardioprotective role of Tbx5 upon heart failure. Data from our earlier murine developmental studies have identified a prominent unipotent Tbx5-expressing embryonic cardiac precursor cell population able to form cardiomyocytes, in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo. Using a developmental approach to an adult heart injury model and by employing a lineage-tracing mouse model as well as the use of single-cell RNA-seq technology, we identify a Tbx5-expressing ventricular cardiomyocyte-like precursor population, in the injured adult mammalian heart. The transcriptional profile of that precursor cell population is closer to that of neonatal than embryonic cardiomyocyte precursors. Tbx5, a cardinal cardiac development transcription factor, lies in the center of a ventricular adult precursor cell population, which seems to be affected by neurohormonal spatiotemporal cues. The identification of a Tbx5-specific cardiomyocyte precursor-like cell population, which is capable of dedifferentiating and potentially deploying a cardiomyocyte regenerative program, provides a clear target cell population for translationally-relevant heart interventional studies.},

 abstract = {We explored the metabolic integration of Blattella germanica and its obligate endosymbiont Blattabacterium cuenoti by the transcriptomic analysis of the fat body of quasi-aposymbiotic cockroaches, where the endosymbionts were almost entirely removed with rifampicin. Fat bodies from quasi-aposymbiotic insects displayed large differences in gene expression compared to controls. In quasi-aposymbionts, the metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine involved in cuticle sclerotization and pigmentation increased drastically to compensate for the deficiency in the biosynthesis of these amino acids by the endosymbionts. On the other hand, the uricolytic pathway and the biosynthesis of uric acid were severely decreased, probably because the reduced population of endosymbionts was unable to metabolize urea to ammonia. Metabolite transporters that could be involved in the endosymbiosis process were identified. Immune system and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression was also reduced in quasi-aposymbionts, genes encoding peptidoglycan-recognition proteins, which may provide clues for the maintenance of the symbiotic relationship, as well as three AMP genes whose involvement in the symbiotic relationship will require additional analysis. Finally, a search for AMP-like factors that could be involved in controlling the endosymbiont identified two orphan genes encoding proteins smaller than 200 amino acids underexpressed in quasi-aposymbionts, suggesting a role in the host–endosymbiont relationship.},

 abstract = {Macrophages (MΦ), known for immunological roles such as phagocytosis and antigen presentation, have been found to electrotonically couple to cardiomyocytes (CM) of the atrio-ventricular node via Cx43, affecting cardiac conduction in isolated mouse hearts. Here, we characterise passive and active electrophysiological properties of murine cardiac resident MΦ, and model their potential electrophysiological relevance for CM.We combined classic electrophysiological approaches with 3 D florescence imaging, RNA-sequencing, pharmacological interventions and computer simulations. We used Cx3cr1eYFP/+ mice wherein cardiac MΦ were fluorescently labelled. FACS-purified fluorescent MΦ from mouse hearts were studied by whole-cell patch-clamp. MΦ electrophysiological properties include: membrane resistance 2.2 ± 0.1 GΩ (all data mean±SEM), capacitance 18.3 ± 0.1 pF, resting membrane potential -39.6 ± 0.3 mV, and several voltage-activated, outward or inwardly-rectifying potassium currents. Using ion channel blockers (barium, TEA, 4-AP, margatoxin, XEN-D0103, DIDS), flow cytometry, immuno-staining and RNA-sequencing, we identified Kv1.3, Kv1.5 and Kir2.1 as channels contributing to observed ion currents. MΦ displayed four patterns for outward and two for inward-rectifier potassium currents. Additionally, MΦ showed surface expression of Cx43, a prerequisite for homo- and/or heterotypic electrotonic coupling. Experimental results fed into development of an original computational model to describe cardiac MΦ electrophysiology. Computer simulations to quantitatively assess plausible effects of MΦ on electrotonically coupled CM showed that MΦ can depolarise resting CM, shorten early and prolong late action potential duration, with effects depending on coupling strength and individual MΦ electrophysiological properties, in particular resting membrane potential and presence/absence of Kir2.1.Our results provide a first electrophysiological characterisation of cardiac resident MΦ, and a computational model to quantitatively explore their relevance in the heterocellular heart. Future work will be focussed at distinguishing electrophysiological effects of MΦ–CM coupling on both cell types during steady-state and in patho-physiological remodelling, when immune cells change their phenotype, proliferate, and/or invade from external sources.Cardiac tissue contains resident macrophages (MΦ) which, beyond immunological and housekeeping roles, have been found to electrotonically couple via connexins to cardiomyocytes (CM), stabilising atrio-ventricular conduction at high excitation rates. Here, we characterise structure and electrophysiological function of murine cardiac MΦ and provide a computational model to quantitatively probe the potential relevance of MΦ-CM coupling for cardiac electrophysiology. We find that MΦ are unlikely to have major electrophysiological effects in normal tissue, where they would hasten early and slow late CM-repolarisation. Further work will address potential arrhythmogenicity of MΦ in patho-physiologically remodelled tissue containing elevated MΦ-numbers, incl. non-resident recruited cells.},

 abstract = {Tetramethrin (TMT) is a commonly used insecticide and has a carcinogenic and neurodegenerative effect on humans. The binding mechanism and toxicological implications of TMT to human serum albumin (HSA) were examined in this study employing a combination of biophysical and computational methods indicating moderate binding affinity and potential hepato and renal toxicity. Fluorescence quenching experiments showed that TMT binds to HSA with a moderate affinity, and the binding process was spontaneous and predominantly enthalpy-driven. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that TMT binding did not induce any significant conformational changes in HSA, resulting in no changes in its alpha-helix content. The binding site and modalities of TMT interactions with HSA as computed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that it binds to Sudlow site II of HSA via hydrophobic interactions through its dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate methyl propanyl group. The structural dynamics of TMT induce proper fit into the binding site creating increased and stabilizing interactions. Additionally, molecular mechanics–Poisson Boltzmann surface area calculations also indicated that non-polar and van der Waals were found to be the major contributors to the high binding free energy of the complex. Quantum mechanics (QM) revealed the conformational energies of the binding confirmation and the degree of deviation from the global minimum energy conformation of TMT. The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the binding mechanism of TMT with HSA, which is important for evaluating the toxicity of this insecticide in humans.},

Approximately, 10\% of the world population is facing the challenge of food allergy in direct or indirect way. In this study, a genome-wide identification and annotation of the novel putative allergen from Almond is performed. Initially, the whole proteome of Almond (31,000 proteins) was scanned by Allergenonline, a publically available database of already reported allergens from different sources. The detailed analysis suggests that there are 430 putative allergens which reduced to 45 on motif-based screening using AllFam database. These predicted allergens are annotated for their function by using PFAM, GO databases and orthology analysis. To validate our prediction, we have used structural insights of allergen and antibody interactions for one of the predicted putative allergen protein, homologous to Pru ar 3.0101allergen from Apricot. The structure of putative allergen was modeled and molecular docking studies were performed against the antibody. The best docked conformation was subjected to molecular simulation studies to confirm the stable binding of these two molecules. This detailed analysis suggests that the identified allergen will show cross reactivity similar to Pru ar 3.0101 allergen from Apricot. This is one of the first report of identifying and annotating the homologous of Pru ar 3.0101 allergen in Almond.},

Coupling MES with the valorization of CO2 from anaerobic digestion and nitrogen from livestock effluents has beneficial environmental effects, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen overloading. In addition, the reducing power needed can come from surplus renewable energy. In this study, MES with a biochar-functionalized cathode was tested at varying polarizations, i.e. non polarized, -0.6 V and -1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl, and biogas-derived CO2 and recovered ammonia from pig slurry was supplied. Negative polarization switched the microbial community from heterotrophic, typical of unpolarized MES, to a mix of both heterotrophic and autotrophic/electrotrophic communities at -0.6 V and to mainly autotrophic/electrotrophic at -1.0 V. The more negative polarization allowed the highest CO2 and N capture, i.e. 39 ± 2 \% of the supplied CO2, and 6.7 ± 0.8 \% supplied N. Microbial biomass characterization indicated a protein content on dry matter basis of 33.1 ± 1.3 \% (unpolarized), 43.2 ± 0.6 \% (-0.6 V) and 69.1 ± 1.0 \% (-1.0 V). The amino acids profiles investigated showed a high nutritional value of the produced biomass, not far from those of conventional protein sources used for producing feed/food.},

 abstract = {The emerging heteropathotype shigatoxigenic (STEC) and extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) O80:H2 has been the second leading cause of pediatric HUS in France since the mid-2010s. In contrast with other highly pathogenic STEC serotypes, for which ruminants have clearly been identified as the main human infection source, this heteropathotype’s reservoir remains unknown. In this context, we describe for the first time the isolation of seven STEC O80:H2 strains from healthy cattle on a single cattle farm in France. This study aimed at (i) characterizing the genome and (ii) investigating the phylogenetic positions of these O80:H2 STEC strains. The virulomes, resistomes, and phylogenetic positions of the seven bovine isolates were investigated using in silico typing tools, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and cgMLST analysis after short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS). One representative isolate (A13P112V1) was also subjected to long-read sequencing. The seven isolates possessed ExPEC-related virulence genes on a pR444\_A-like mosaic plasmid, previously described in strain RDEx444 and known to confer multi-drug resistance. All isolates were clonally related and clustered with human clinical strains from France and Switzerland with a range of locus differences of only one to five. In conclusion, our findings suggest that healthy cattle in France could potentially act as a reservoir of the STEC-ExPEC O80:H2 pathotype.},

We are pleased to announce our 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Data Science (ICBDS – 2022) and 9th International Conference on Public Mental Health and Neurosciences (ICPMN – 2022) which was a unique conference where we connectted Biological Function through Computational Genomics to the world of integrated medicine and therapeutics. Functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. This science aims to understand the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype on a global (genome-wide) scale of different biological processes. Most researchers now study genes or regions on a “genome-wide” scale (i.e. all or multiple genes/regions at the same time), with the hope of narrowing them down to a list of candidate genes or regions to analyze in more detail. There are several specific functional genomics approaches depending on what we are focused on DNA level (genomics and epigenomics), RNA level (transcriptomics), protein level (proteomics), metabolite level (metabolomics) and phenotype level (phenomics). The recent trends in gene and genome editing technologies, promising genomic information can be modulated in the areas of medicine, agriculture and environment. Big data is a promising in many research areas, but still it is computationally challenging and non-availability of experts to handle big-data with reduced speed and cost. With the increasing use of advanced technology and the exploding amount of big-data in, it is imperative to introduce effective and efficient methods to handle big data using computing technologies. The big data analytics technique is required to solve the problems in bioinformatics such as the storage of vast information generated by analyzing the big-data. Big data analytics can examine large data sets, analyze and correlate genomic and proteomic information. Big data research finds a huge application in Neuroscience and Brain research. Our unique conference connects genomics to the world of genomics to integrated medicine including yogic sciences.},

However, bolting affects quality, gives it a bitter taste, and as a result makes it inedible. Bolting is an event induced by the coordinated effects of various environmental factors and endogenous genetic components. Although bolting/flowering responsive genes have been identified in most sensitive and non-sensitive species, non-coding RNA molecules like long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have not been investigated in lettuce. Hence, in this study, potential long non-coding RNAs that regulate flowering /bolting were investigated in two lettuce strains S24 (resistant strain) and S39 (susceptible strain) in different flowering times to better understand the regulation of lettuce bolting mechanism. For this purpose, we used two RNA-seq datasets to discover the lncRNA transcriptome profile during the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase.},

The diagnosis rate is, however, still not 100\%. This paper reports the use of a personalized multi-omics (metabolomic, genomic and transcriptomic) pipeline plus functional genomics to aid in the genetic diagnosis of six unsolved cases, with a clinical and/or biochemical diagnosis of galactosemia, mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), citrullinemia, or urea cycle deficiency. Eight novel variants in six genes were identified: six (four of them deep intronic) located in GALE, IDUA, PTS, ASS1 and OTC, all affecting the splicing process, and two located in the promoters of IDUA and PTS, thus affecting these genes’ expression. All the new variants were subjected to functional analysis to verify their pathogenic effects. This work underscores how the combination of different omics technologies and functional analysis can solve elusive cases in clinical practice.},

 abstract = {Amidst the current biodiversity crisis, the availability of genomic resources for declining species can provide important insights into the factors driving population decline. In the early 1990s, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a pelagic gull widely distributed across the arctic, subarctic, and temperate zones, suffered a steep population decline following an abrupt warming of sea surface temperature across its distribution range and is currently listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Kittiwakes have long been the focus for field studies of physiology, ecology, and ecotoxicology and are primary indicators of fluctuating ecological conditions in arctic and subarctic marine ecosystems. We present a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome and annotation for the black-legged kittiwake using a combination of Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing, Bionano optical maps, Hi-C reads, and RNA-Seq data. The final assembly spans 1.35 Gb across 32 chromosomes, with a scaffold N50 of 88.21 Mb and a BUSCO completeness of 97.4\%. This genome assembly substantially improves the quality of a previous draft genome, showing an approximately 5× increase in contiguity and a more complete annotation. Using this new chromosome-level reference genome and three more chromosome-level assemblies of Charadriiformes, we uncover several lineage-specific chromosome fusions and fissions, but find no shared rearrangements, suggesting that interchromosomal rearrangements have been commonplace throughout the diversification of Charadriiformes. This new high-quality genome assembly will enable population genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotype–genotype association studies in a widely studied sentinel species, which may provide important insights into the impacts of global change on marine systems.},

 abstract = {Globe artichoke ecotypes sanitized from plant pathogen infections are characterized by high vegetative vigor, productivity, and quality of capitula. The recent availability on the market of these plants has renewed the interest of farmers and pharmaceutical industries in the crop. Globe artichoke exhibits interesting nutraceutical properties due to the high content of health-promoting bioactive compounds (BACs), such as polyphenols, that could be extracted from waste biomass. The production of BACs depends on several factors including the plant portion considered, the globe artichoke variety/ecotype, and the physiological status of the plants, linked to biotic and abiotic stresses. We investigated the influence of viral infections on polyphenol accumulation in two Apulian late-flowering ecotypes “Locale di Mola tardivo” and “Troianella”, comparing sanitized virus-free material (S) vs. naturally virus-infected (non-sanitized, NS) plants. Transcriptome analysis of the two ecotypes highlighted that differentially expressed genes (DEGs), in the two tested conditions, were mainly involved in primary metabolism and processing of genetic/environmental information. The up-regulation of the genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and the analysis of peroxidase activity suggested that their modulation is influenced by the phytosanitary status of the plant and is ecotype-dependent. Conversely, the phytochemical analysis showed a remarkable decrease in polyphenols and lignin accumulation in S artichokes compared to NS plants. This unique study analyzes the potential of growing vigorous, sanitized plants, in order to have high amounts of ‘soft and clean’ biomass, finalized for BAC extraction for nutraceutical purposes. This, in turn, opens new perspectives for a circular economy of sanitized artichokes, in line with the current phytosanitary standards and sustainable development goals.},

 abstract = {This work monitored the effect of a municipal and a village wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) technology on the fate of beta-lactam resistance genes in bacterial populations in different phases of the wastewater treatment process. In case of the municipal WWTP1, the bacteria possessing a high ampicillin resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 20 mg/mL) accumulated in the sedimentation tank, which was accompanied with a higher concentration of ampicillin in the wastewater samples (28.09 ng/L) and an increase in the relative abundance of the blaTEM gene in the bacterial population. However, an opposite trend was revealed with the blaNDM-1 gene, making the sedimentation processes of WWTP1 crucial only for the accumulation of the blaTEM gene. Similarly, the comparison with the WWTP2 showed that the accumulation of the ampicillin resistance in bacterial population probably depended on the WWTP technology and wastewater composition. Out of the four tested resistance genes (blaTEM, blaKPC, blaNDM-1, and blaOXA-48), blaTEM and blaNDM-1 genes were the only two detected in this study. According to NGS analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene, Gammaproteobacteria dominated the ampicillin-resistant bacteria of the WWTP sedimentation tanks. Their relative abundance in the bacterial population also increased during the sedimentation processes in WWTP1. It could indicate the role of the bacterial taxon in ampicillin resistance accumulation in this WWTP and show that only 9.29\% of the original bacterial population from the nitrification tank is involved in the documented shifts in beta-lactam resistance of the bacterial population.},

 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer, often diagnosed at stages that dis-qualify for surgical resection. Neoadjuvant therapies offer potential tumor regression and improved resectability. Although features of the tumor biology (e.g., molecular markers) may guide adjuvant therapy, biological alterations after neoadjuvant therapy remain largely unexplored. We performed mass spectrometry to characterize the proteomes of 67 PDAC resection specimens of patients who received either neoadjuvant chemo (NCT) or chemo-radiation (NCRT) therapy. We employed data-independent acquisition (DIA), yielding a proteome coverage in excess of 3500 proteins. Moreover, we successfully integrated two publicly available proteome datasets of treatment-naïve PDAC to unravel proteome alterations in response to neoadjuvant therapy, highlighting the feasibility of this approach. We found highly distinguishable proteome profiles. Treatment-naïve PDAC was characterized by enrichment of immunoglobulins, complement and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Post-NCT and post-NCRT PDAC presented high abundance of ribosomal and metabolic proteins as compared to treatment-naïve PDAC. Further analyses on patient survival and protein expression identified treatment-specific prognostic candidates. We present the first proteomic characterization of the residual PDAC mass after NCT and NCRT, and potential protein candidate markers associated with overall survival. We conclude that residual PDAC exhibits fundamentally different proteome profiles as compared to treatment-naïve PDAC, influenced by the type of neoadjuvant treatment. These findings may impact adjuvant or targeted therapy options.},

@article{stojkovic_targeted_2024,
 abstract = {Detrimental molecular processes in multiple sclerosis (MS) lead to the cellular accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and iron in the CNS, which represents the main driving force for ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, with proposed roles in neurodegeneration, oligodendrocyte loss and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of MS. Ferroptosis-related gene expression signature and molecular markers, which could reflect MS severity and progression, are currently understudied in humans. To tackle these challenges, we have applied a curated approach to create and experimentally analyze a comprehensive panel of ferroptosis-related genes covering a wide range of biological processes associated with ferroptosis. We performed the first ferroptosis-related targeted RNAseq on PBMCs from highly distinctive MS phenotype groups: mild relapsing–remitting (RR) (n = 24) and severe secondary progressive (SP) (n = 24), along with protein detection of GPX4 and products of lipid peroxidation (MDA and 4-HNE). Out of 138 genes, 26 were differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicating changes in both pro- and anti-ferroptotic genes, representing a molecular signature associated with MS severity. The top three DEGs, as non-core ferroptosis genes, CDKN1A, MAP1B and EGLN2, were replicated by qPCR to validate findings in independent patient groups (16 RR and 16 SP MS). Co-expression and interactions of DEGs were presented as additional valuable assets for deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and key targets related to MS severity. Our study integrates a wide genetic signature and biochemical markers related to ferroptosis in easily obtainable PBMCs of MS patients with clinical data and disease severity, thus providing novel molecular markers which can complement disease-related changes in the brain and undergo further research as potential therapeutic targets.},

 abstract = {Abstract The present study aimed to explore the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of biofilm formation in Bulgarian nosocomial Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates (n = 221) during the period 2011–2022, by screening for the presence of biofilm-associated genes (BAG) (spgM, rmlA and rpfF), their mutational variability, and assessment of the adherent growth on a polystyrene surface. The methodology included: PCR amplification, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and crystal violet microtiter plate assay for biofilm quantification. The overall incidence of BAG was: spgM 98.6\%, rmlA 86\%, and rpfF 66.5\%. The most prevalent genotype was spgM+/rmlA+/rpfF+ (56.1\%), followed by spgM+/rmlA+/rpfF- (28.5\%), and spgM+/rmlA-/rpfF+ (9.5\%), with their significant predominance in lower respiratory tract isolates compared to those with other origin (P {\textless} 0.001). All strains examined were characterized as strong biofilm producers (OD550 from 0.224 ± 0.049 to 2.065 ± 0.023) with a single exception that showed a weak biofilm-forming ability (0.177 ± 0.024). No significant differences were observed in the biofilm formation according to the isolation source, as well as among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 isolates (1.256 ± 0.028 vs. 1.348 ± 0.128, respectively). Also, no correlation was found between the biofilm amounts and the corresponding genotypes. WGS showed that the rmlA accumulated a larger number of variants (0.0086 per base) compared to the other BAG, suggesting no critical role of its product to the biofilm formation. Additionally, two of the isolates were found to harbour class 1 integrons (7-kb and 2.6-kb sized, respectively) containing sul1 in their 3′ conservative ends, which confers sulfonamide resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on S. maltophilia biofilm formation in Bulgaria, which also identifies novel sequence types (ST819, ST820 and ST826). It demonstrates the complex nature of this adaptive mechanism in the multifactorial pathogenesis of biofilm-associated infections.},

 abstract = {Abstract Cefiderocol (CFDC) is a first-in-class siderophore cephalosporin with potent activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The present study aimed to explore the CFDC resistance mechanisms of an extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate from Bulgaria. The A. baumannii Aba52 strain (designated Aba52) was obtained in 2018 from a blood sample of a critically ill patient. The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenomic analysis. The isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to CFDC (MIC = 64 mg L−1), resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tigecycline, as well as susceptibility only to colistin. WGS-based resistome analysis revealed the existence of blaOXA-23, blaOXA-66 and blaADC-73. Seven non-conservative missense mutations affecting iron transport-related genes were detected: exbD4 (p.Ser61Pro), tonB2 (p.Ala268Val), bauA (p.Thr61Ala), ftsI (p.Ala515Val), piuA (p.Gly216Val), and feoB (p.Ser429Pro and p.Thr595Ala). A variety of virulence factors associated with adherence, biofilm formation, enzyme production, immune invasion, iron uptake, quorum sensing, and two-component regulatory systems were identified, suggesting a significant pathogenic potential of Aba52. The performed RT-qPCR analysis showed diminished (0.17) and absent expression of the pirA and piuA genes, respectively, encoding TonB-dependent siderophore receptors. Aba52 belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence type ST2 (Pasteur scheme). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of CFDC-resistant A. baumannii in Bulgaria even though, CFDC has never been applied in our country. The emerging resistance highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance targeting the implementation of novel antibiotics.},

The present study aimed to explore the genomic characteristics of two Vietnamese extended-spectrum β-lactamase-9 (VEB-9)-producing XDR-PA isolates from Bulgaria in comparison to all blaVEB-9-positive strains with available genomes. The isolates designated Pae51 and Pae52 were obtained from tracheobronchial aspirates of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, RT-qPCR, and phylogenomic analysis were performed. Pae51 and Pae52 were resistant to most antipseudomonal β-lactams including carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones but remained susceptible to colistin and cefiderocol. Numerous resistance determinants were detected: blaVEB-9, blaPDC-3, blaOXA-10, blaOXA-50, aac(6′)-II, ant(2″)-Ia, ant(3″)-IIa, aph(3′)-IIb, cprP, catB7, dfrB2, sul1, fosA, and tet(A). Both isolates carried complex integrons with blaVEB-9 and tet(A) embedded next to the conservative 3′ end sequences. A variety of virulence factors were also identified, including the type III secretion system exotoxin U. Pae51 and Pae52 differed by only four SNPs and belonged to the high-risk clone ST357. To our knowledge, this is the first report of blaVEB-9-positive XDR-PA isolates in Bulgaria presenting a detailed genomic analysis. The development of novel antimicrobial strategies for such pathogens should be an essential part of infection control stewardship practices in ICU wards.},

PCR amplification, enzymatic assays, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and biofilm quantification on a polystyrene plate were performed. The incidence of virulence determinants was as follows: stmPr1 (encoding for the major extracellular protease StmPr1) 87.3\%, stmPr2 (minor extracellular protease StmPr2) 99.1\%, Smlt3773 locus (outer membrane esterase) 98.2\%, plcN1 (non-hemolytic phospholipase C) 99.1\%, and smf-1 (type-1 fimbriae, biofilm-related gene) 96.4\%. The 1621-bp allele of stmPr1 was most frequently found (61.1\%), followed by the combined allelic variant (17.6\%), stmPr1-negative genotype (12.7\%), and 868-bp allele (8.6\%). Protease, esterase, and lecithinase activity was observed in 95\%, 98.2\%, and 17.2\% of the isolates, respectively. The WGS-subjected isolates (n = 9) formed two groups. Five isolates possessed only the 1621-bp variant of stmPr1, higher biofilm formation ability (Optical Density at λ = 550 nm (OD550): 1.253–1.789), as well as a low number of mutations in the protease genes and smf-1. Three other isolates had only the 868-bp variant, weaker biofilm production (OD550: 0.788–1.108), and higher number of mutations within these genes. The only weak biofilm producer (OD550 = 0.177) had no stmPr1 alleles. In conclusion, the similar PCR detection rates did not allow differentiation of the isolates. In contrast, WGS permitted stmPr1 alleles-based differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Bulgarian study presenting genotypic and phenotypic insights into virulence factors of S. maltophilia isolates.},

 abstract = {The circulation of Omicron BA.1 led to the rapid increase in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in South Africa in November 2021, which warranted the use of more rapid detection methods. We, therefore, assessed the ability to detect Omicron BA.1 using genotyping assays to identify specific mutations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, Gauteng province, South Africa. The TaqPath™ COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was performed on all samples selected to identify spike gene target failure (SGTF). SARS-CoV-2 genotyping assays were used for the detection of del69/70 and K417N mutation. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on a subset of genotyped samples to confirm these findings. Of the positive samples received, 11.0\% (175/1589) were randomly selected to assess if SGTF and genotyping assays, that detect del69/70 and K417N mutations, could identify Omicron BA.1. We identified SGTF in 98.9\% (173/175) of samples, of which 88.0\% (154/175) had both the del69/70 and K417N mutation. The genotyped samples (45.7\%; 80/175) that were sequenced confirmed Omicron BA.1 (97.5\%; 78/80). Our data show that genotyping for the detection of the del69/70 and K417N coupled with SGTF is efficient to exclude Alpha and Beta variants and rapidly detect Omicron BA.1. However, we still require assays for the detection of unique mutations that will allow for the differentiation between other Omicron sublineages. Therefore, the use of genotyping assays to detect new dominant or emerging lineages of SARS-CoV-2 will be beneficial in limited-resource settings.},

This study investigated the frequency and diversity of the spike (S) protein mutations within SARS-CoV-2 infected South African individuals. The study included SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples, from individuals of all ages, received at the National Health Laboratory Service at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic hospital, Gauteng, South Africa, from June 2020 to May 2022. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays and whole genome sequencing were performed on a random selection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The allele frequency (AF) was determined using TaqMan Genotyper software for SNP PCR analysis and galaxy.eu for analysis of FASTQ reads from sequencing. The SNP assays identified 5.3\% (50/948) of Delta cases with heterogeneity at delY144 (4\%; 2/50), E484Q (6\%; 3/50), N501Y (2\%; 1/50) and P681H (88\%; 44/50), however only heterogeneity for E484Q and delY144 were confirmed by sequencing. From sequencing we identified 9\% (210/2381) of cases with Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, BA.2.15, and BA.4 lineages that had heterogeneity in the S protein. Heterogeneity was primarily identified at positions 19 (1.4\%) with T19IR (AF 0.2–0.7), 371 (92.3\%) with S371FP (AF 0.1–1.0), and 484 (1.9\%) with E484AK (0.2–0.7), E484AQ (AF 0.4–0.5) and E484KQ (AF 0.1–0.4). Mutations at heterozygous amino acid positions 19, 371 and 484 are known antibody escape mutations, however the impact of the combination of multiple substitutions identified at the same position is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesise that intra-host SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with heterogeneity in the S protein facilitate competitive advantage of variants that can completely/partially evade host’s natural and vaccine-induced immune responses.},

Gene expression datasets of tuberculosis patients samples treated with different antibiotics (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Bedaquiline and Linezolid) were considered in this study. DESeq2 was used to identify the differentially regulated genes. Novel genes which were up-regulated during antibiotic treatment were identified which could be antibiotic resistance factors. Further, to understand the resistance mechanism of the novel genes, we performed gene ontology and gene network analysis for the differentially up-regulated genes. Thus, the in-silico transcriptome analysis paves way for a deeper understanding of the antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis.},

Their epidemic and pandemic clones often accumulate useful accessory genes in their genomes, such as AMR genes (ARGs) and virulence factor genes (VFGs). This process is facilitated by horizontal gene transfer among microbial communities via mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids and phages. Nanopore long-read sequencing allows easy and inexpensive analysis of complex bacterial genome structures, although some aspects of sequencing data calculation and genome analysis methods are not systematically understood. Here we describe the latest and most recommended experimental and bioinformatics methods available for the construction of complete bacterial genomes from nanopore sequencing data and the detection and classification of genotypes of bacterial chromosomes, ARGs, VFGs, plasmids, and other MGEs based on their genomic sequences for genomic epidemiological analysis of AMR bacteria.},

 abstract = {The 52 members of the Teosinte-Branched 1/Cycloidea/Proliferating Cell Factors (TCP) Transcription Factor gene family in Malus × domestica (M. × domestica) were identified in 2014 on the first genome assembly, which was released in 2010. In 2017, a higher quality genome assembly for apple was released and is now considered to be the reference genome. Moreover, as in several other species, the identified TCP genes were named based on the relative position of the genes on the chromosomes. The present work consists of an update of the TCP gene family based on the latest genome assembly of M. × domestica. Compared to the previous classification, the number of TCP genes decreased from 52 to 40 as a result of the addition of three sequences and the deduction of 15. An analysis of the intragenic identity led to the identification of 15 pairs of orthologs, shedding light on the forces that shaped the evolution of this gene family. Furthermore, a revised nomenclature system is proposed that is based both on the intragenic identity and the homology with Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) TCPs in an effort to set a common standard for the TCP classification that will facilitate any future interspecific analysis.},

 abstract = {Vibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly associated with mackerel poisoning. A bacteriophage that specifically targets and lyses this bacterium could be employed as a biocontrol agent for treating the bacterial infection or improving the shelf-life of mackerel products. However, only a few well-characterized V. alginolyticus phages have been reported in the literature. In this study, a novel lytic phage, named ΦImVa-1, specifically infecting V. alginolyticus strain ATCC 17749, was isolated from Indian mackerel. The phage has a short latent period of 15 min and a burst size of approximately 66 particles per infected bacterium. ΦImVa-1 remained stable for 2 h at a wide temperature (27–75 °C) and within a pH range of 5 to 10. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that ΦImVa-1 has an icosahedral head of approximately 60 nm in diameter with a short tail, resembling those in the Schitoviridae family. High throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis elucidated that ΦImVa-1 has a linear dsDNA genome of 77,479 base pairs (bp), with a G + C content of {\textasciitilde} 38.72\% and 110 predicted gene coding regions (106 open reading frames and four tRNAs). The genome contains an extremely large virion-associated RNA polymerase gene and two smaller non-virion-associated RNA polymerase genes, which are hallmarks of schitoviruses. No antibiotic genes were found in the ΦImVa-1 genome. This is the first paper describing the biological properties, morphology, and the complete genome of a V. alginolyticus-infecting schitovirus. When raw mackerel fish flesh slices were treated with ΦImVa-1, the pathogen loads reduced significantly, demonstrating the potential of the phage as a biocontrol agent for V. alginolyticus strain ATCC 17749 in the food.},

 abstract = {Abstract The essential splicing factor U2AF65 is known to help anchoring U2 snRNP at the branch site. Its C-terminal UHM domain interacts with ULM motifs of SF3b155, an U2 snRNP protein. Here, we report a cooperative binding of U2AF65 and the related protein CAPERα to the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. In addition, we show that the RS domain of U2AF65 drives a liquid?liquid phase separation that is amplified by intronic RNA with repeated pyrimidine tracts. In cells, knockdown of either U2AF65 or CAPERα improves the inclusion of cassette exons that are preceded by such repeated pyrimidine-rich motifs. These results support a model in which liquid-like assemblies of U2AF65 and CAPERα on repetitive pyrimidine-rich RNA sequences are driven by their RS domains, and facilitate the recruitment of the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. We anticipate that posttranslational modifications and proteins recruited in dynamical U2AF65 and CAPERα condensates may further contribute to the complex mechanisms leading to specific splice site choice that occurs in cells.},

 abstract = {The WHIRLY (WHY) family of DNA/RNA binding proteins fulfil multiple but poorly characterised functions in plants. We analysed WHY protein functions in the Arabidopsis Atwhy1, Atwhy3, Atwhy1why3 single and double mutants and wild type controls. The Atwhy3 and Atwhy1why3 double mutants showed a significant delay in flowering, having more siliques per plant but with fewer seeds per silique than the wild type. While germination was similar in the unaged high-quality seeds of all lines, significant decreases in vigour and viability were observed in the aged mutant seeds compared with the wild type. Imbibition of unaged high-quality seeds was characterised by large increases in transcripts that encode proteins involved in oxygen sensing and responses to hypoxia. Seed aging resulted in a disruption of the imbibition-induced transcriptome profile such that transcripts encoding RNA metabolism and processing became the most abundant components of the imbibition signature. The imbibition-related profile of the Atwhy1why3 mutant seeds, was characterised by decreased expression of hypoxia-related and oxygen metabolism genes even in the absence of aging. Seed aging further decreased the abundance of hypoxia-related and oxygen metabolism transcripts relative to the wild type. These findings suggest that the WHY1 and WHY3 proteins regulate the imbibition-induced responses to oxygen availability and hypoxia. Loss of WHY1 and WHY3 functions decreases the ability of Arabidopsis seeds to resist the adverse effects of seed aging.},

The Baltic Sea is infamous for its annual cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Nodularia spumigena, Aphanizomenon spp., and Dolichospermum spp. that cause harm, especially for recreational users. To broaden our knowledge of the cyanobacterial adaptation strategies for brackish water environments, we sequenced the entire genome of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, a species occurring not only in freshwater environments but also in brackish water. Comparative genomics analyses revealed a close association with Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0090 isolated from a lake in Finland. The genome closure of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315 unraveled a mixture of two subtypes in the original culture, and subtypes exhibited distinct buoyancy phenotypes. Salinity less than 3 g L−1 NaCl enabled proper growth of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, whereas growth was arrested at moderate salinity (6 g L−1 NaCl). The concentrations of toxins, microcystins, increased at moderate salinity, whereas RNA sequencing data implied that Dolichospermum remodeled its primary metabolism in unfavorable high salinity. Based on our results, the predicted salinity decrease in the Baltic Sea may favor toxic blooms of Dolichospermum spp.},

The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing requirements and the statistically driven methods needed to process and understand these ever-growing datasets.Here we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for single-cell RNA-sequencing, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal.The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms. The tutorials from the Galaxy Training Network along with the frequent training workshops hosted by the Galaxy community provide a means for users to learn, publish, and teach single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis.},

 abstract = {The mitochondrial genomes of apicomplexans comprise merely three protein-coding genes, alongside a set of thirty to forty genes encoding small RNAs (sRNAs), many of which exhibit homologies to rRNA from E. coli. The expression status and integration of these short RNAs into ribosomes remains unclear and direct evidence for active ribosomes within apicomplexan mitochondria is still lacking. In this study, we conducted small RNA sequencing on the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii to investigate the occurrence and function of mitochondrial sRNAs. To enhance the analysis of sRNA sequencing outcomes, we also re-sequenced the T. gondii mitochondrial genome using an improved organelle enrichment protocol and Nanopore sequencing. It has been established previously that the T. gondii genome comprises 21 sequence blocks that undergo recombination among themselves but that their order is not entirely random. The enhanced coverage of the mitochondrial genome allowed us to characterize block combinations at increased resolution. Employing this refined genome for sRNA mapping, we find that many small RNAs originated from the junction sites between protein-coding blocks and rRNA sequence blocks. Surprisingly, such block border sRNAs were incorporated into polysomes together with canonical rRNA fragments and mRNAs. In conclusion, apicomplexan ribosomes are active within polysomes and are indeed assembled through the integration of sRNAs, including previously undetected sRNAs with merged mRNA-rRNA sequences. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that T. gondii’s block-based genome organization enables the dual utilization of mitochondrial sequences as both messenger RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, potentially establishing a link between the regulation of rRNA and mRNA expression.},

This study investigates transcriptomic alterations in rodent models of ICH and severe ICH to shed light on the genetic pathways involved in hemorrhagic brain injury. We performed principal component analysis, revealing distinct principal component segments of normal rats compared to ICH and severe ICH rats. We employed heatmaps and volcano plots to identify differentially expressed genes and utilized bar plots and KEGG pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular pathways involved. We identified a multitude of differentially expressed genes in both the ICH and severe ICH models. Our results revealed 5679 common genes among the normal, ICH, and severe ICH groups in the upregulated genes group, and 1196 common genes in the downregulated genes, respectively. A volcano plot comparing these groups further highlighted common genes, including PDPN, TIMP1, SERPINE1, TUBB6, and CD44. These findings underscore the complex interplay of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis uncovered key signaling pathways, including the TNF signaling pathway, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, MAPK signaling pathway, and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, implicated in the pathogenesis of ICH.},

In this study, the efficacy of anaerobic fungal consortia (AFC) from five different inocula, including Bubalus bubalis rumen fluid (RU), in degrading filter paper, microcrystalline cellulose, and rice straw (RS), was screened. The AFC from RU performed best in lignocellulosic material degradation and methane production; thus, RU was selected for further experiments. Consecutive batch subculturing (CBS) was performed in RU to enrich and stabilize the dominant and key microorganisms categorized as anaerobic fungi, using the addition of antibacterial agents to suppress the growth of untargeted bacteria. After the CBS, subculture E19 proved the most efficient, with RS degradation of 84\% and a methane yield of 310 mL/g VSadded, representing 1.83- and 2.25-fold increases compared to the initial seed, respectively. The microbial community of E19 consisted of anaerobic fungi (uncultured Neocallimastigales, Anaeromyces sp., Orpinomyces sp., and Feramyces sp.) coexisting with anaerobic bacteria (streptomycin resistant Proteiniphilum acetatigenes), and methanogens. The E19 consortium was able to use various carbon sources (87.5\%) and contained potential genes encoding enzymes involved in RS degradation. The microbial community of E19 was highly stable, making it a promising inoculum for biomass degradation, especially for anaerobic digestion to produce biogas.},

Subtle modifications in such early events are likely to have major impacts in later morphogenesis, bringing along morphological diversification. Here, comparing the blind cave and the surface morphotypes of Astyanax mexicanus fish, we found heterochronies during gastrulation that produce organizer and axial mesoderm tissues with different properties (including differences in the expression of dkk1b) that may have contributed to cavefish brain evolution. These variations observed during gastrulation depend fully on maternal factors. The developmental evolution of retinal morphogenesis and hypothalamic patterning are among those traits that retained significant maternal influence at larval stages. Transcriptomic analysis of fertilized eggs from both morphotypes and reciprocal F1 hybrids showed a strong and specific maternal signature. Our work strongly suggests that maternal effect genes and developmental heterochronies that occur during gastrulation have impacted morphological brain change during cavefish evolution.},

 abstract = {Phytoplasmas are linked to diseases in hundreds of economically important crops, including carrots. In carrots, phytoplasmosis is associated with leaf chlorosis and necrosis, coupled with inhibited root system development, ultimately leading to significant economic losses. During a field study conducted in Baden-Württemberg (Germany), two strains of the provisional taxon ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’ were identified within a carrot plot. For further analysis, strains M8 and M33 underwent shotgun sequencing, utilising single-molecule-real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing and sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) paired-end short-read sequencing techniques. Hybrid assemblies resulted in complete de novo assemblies of two genomes harboring circular chromosomes and two plasmids. Analyses, including average nucleotide identity and sequence comparisons of established marker genes, confirmed the phylogenetic divergence of ‘Ca. P. asteris’ and a different assignment of strains to the 16S rRNA subgroup I-A for M33 and I-B for M8. These groups exhibited unique features, encompassing virulence factors and genes, associated with the mobilome. In contrast, pan-genome analysis revealed a highly conserved gene set related to metabolism across these strains. This analysis of the Aster Yellows (AY) group reaffirms the perception of phytoplasmas as bacteria that have undergone extensive genome reduction during their co-evolution with the host and an increase of genome size by mobilome.},

 abstract = {Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli ST131 has become widespread worldwide. This study aims to characterize the virulome, resistome, and population structure of E. coli ST131 isolates from clinical blood samples in Hungary. A total of 30 C2/H30Rx and 33 C1-M27 ST131 isolates were selected for Illumina MiSeq sequencing and 30 isolates for MinION sequencing, followed by hybrid de novo assembly. Five C2/H30Rx and one C1-M27 cluster were identified. C1-M27 isolates harbored the F1:A2:B20 plasmid in 93.9\% of cases. Long-read sequencing revealed that blaCTX-M-27 was on plasmids. Among the C2/H30Rx isolates, only six isolates carried the C2-associated F2:A1:B- plasmid type. Of 19 hybrid-assembled C2/H30Rx genomes, the blaCTX-M-15 gene was located on plasmid only in one isolate, while in the other isolates, ISEcp1 or IS26-mediated chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M-15 was detected in unique variations. In one isolate a part of F2:A1:B- plasmid integrated into the chromosome. These results suggest that CTX-M-15-producing C2/H30Rx and CTX-M-27-producing C1-M27 subclades may have emerged and spread in different ways in Hungary. While blaCTX-M-27 was carried mainly on the C1/H30R-associated F1:A2:B20 plasmid, the IncF-like plasmids of C2/H30Rx or its composite transposons have been incorporated into the chromosome through convergent evolutionary processes.},

 abstract = {Sexual differentiation of inflorescences and flowers is important for reproduction and affects crop plant productivity. We report here on a molecular study of the process of sexual differentiation in the immature inflorescence of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). This species is monoecious and exhibits gender diphasy, producing male and female inflorescences separately on the same plant in alternation. Three main approaches were used: small RNA-seq to characterise and study the expression of miRNA genes; RNA-seq to monitor mRNA accumulation patterns; hormone quantification to assess the role of cytokinins and auxins in inflorescence differentiation. Our study allowed the characterisation of 30 previously unreported palm MIRNA genes. In differential gene and miRNA expression studies, we identified a number of key developmental genes and miRNA-mRNA target modules previously described in relation to their developmental regulatory role in the cereal panicle, notably the miR156/529/535-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) gene regulatory module. Gene enrichment analysis highlighted the importance of hormone-related genes, and this observation was corroborated by the detection of much higher levels of cytokinins in the female inflorescence. Our data illustrate the importance of branching regulation within the developmental window studied, during which the female inflorescence, unlike its male counterpart, produces flower clusters on new successive axes by sympodial growth.},

The aim ofthis study was to assess the antifibrotic effects of anti-S100A4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in murine models of SScand in precision cut skin slices of patients with SSc.Methods.The effects of anti-S100A4 mAbs were evaluated in a bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis model and inTsk-1 mice with a therapeutic dosing regimen. In addition, the effects of anti-S100A4 mAbs on precision cut SSc skinslices were analyzed by RNA sequencing.Results.Inhibition of S100A4 was effective in the treatment of pre-established bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis andin regression of pre-establishedfibrosis with reduced dermal thickening, myofibroblast counts, and collagen accumu-lation. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated targeting of multiple profibrotic and proinflammatory processes relevantto the pathogenesis of SSc on targeted S100A4 inhibition in a bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis model. Moreover, tar-geted S100A4 inhibition also modulated inflammation- andfibrosis-relevant gene sets in precision cut SSc skin slicesin an ex vivo trial approach. Selected downstream targets of S100A4, such as AMP-activated protein kinase,calsequestrin-1, and phosphorylated STAT3, were validated on the protein level, and STAT3 inhibition was shown toprevent the profibrotic effects of S100A4 onfibroblasts in human skin.Conclusion.Inhibition of S100A4 confers dual targeting of inflammatory andfibrotic pathways in complementarymouse models offibrosis and in SSc skin. These effects support the further development of anti-S100A4 mAbs asdisease-modifying targeted therapies for SSc.},

 abstract = {RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of peripheral blood can be a valuable source of information for investigating the status and mechanism of diseases. However, blood contains 50–80\% unwanted hemoglobin (Hb) transcripts. Lexogen’s QuantSeq mRNA-Seq-Kit for Illumina RNA-Seq features a ‘Globin Block’ (GB) module that depletes Hb cDNAs during library preparation. Here, we aimed to assess GB’s effectiveness and checked for technical biases attributable to GB. Using whole blood total RNA samples of 91 healthy individuals, we sequenced 91 pairs of GB and non-blocked samples (noGB) on Illumina HiSeq2500 and 8 pairs of GB/noGB technical replicates on HiSeq4000. GB reduced the fraction of Hb transcripts from 43\% (s.d. 14\%) to 8.0\% (s.d. 4.3\%). From GB samples we detected 1,397 more expressed genes at approximately 11 million reads per RNA-isolate. Enrichment and differential expression analyses did not reveal significant differences for GB and noGB samples with respect to molecular function. In contrast to results from studies that have examined the performance of GB during RNA isolation, we were able to assign GB to corresponding noGB samples (from multiple sequencing runs on HiSeq2500) with at least 89.8\% accuracy from the complete correlation matrix of all GB/GB, noGB/noGB and GB/noGB pairs. However, the use of different sequencers (HiSeq2500 vs HiSeq4000) impaired assignment of technical replicates, whereas assignment of GB to corresponding noGB samples worked perfectly when sequencing on one lane on HiSeq4000. Lexogen’s GB RNA-Seq module is a valuable addition during mRNA-Seq library preparation which works even with low amounts of input total RNA (50 ng per sample). GB facilitated the detection of low abundant transcripts and yielded more non-hemoglobin reads, while preserving biological information. We observed that differences in sequencing run and platform have a far greater effect on technical variation than the use of GB.},

Herein, we present the first transcriptomic datasets of three species of Opuntia. Comparative transcriptome profiling provides insights into the molecular and physiological functions between species and tissues. Total RNA from young cladodes and developing fruits of O. ficus-indica, O. robusta and O. joconostle was purified and sequenced by Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends technology, an RNA-seq variant. A total of 8383, 7890, and 5300 transcripts and GC content of 40.1, 39.9 and 40.1\% were obtained for the de novo assembly of O. ficus-indica, O. robusta and O. joconostle, respectively. For annotations, about 22.2–23.7\% of transcripts had matches in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database. Moreover, the enriched 21 COG categories, 282 KEGG pathways and 2793 GO terms revealed that the transcriptomes obtained included functionally diverse genes in Opuntia. Differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between fruit and cladode resulted in the enrichment of 13 significant KEGG pathways and 80 GO terms, where some genes viz. FULL, CYP75B1, and CMB1 were upregulated in the fruits of the three species. Between species, the most enriched GOs fell into the category of “Cellular Components”, which would explain the morphological and physiological differences between the three species. Moreover, DETs comparisons between fruit types and between cladodes were also reported. Overall, the transcriptomic data generated in this study provide the initial resources to understand the biology of Opuntia, offering new insight to understand its morphology, systematic and adaptation.},

From the de novo assembly of A. angustifolia, a total of 358,170 transcripts with average length of 1117 bp, N50 of 858 bp, and GC mean content of 43.5\% were obtained. About 48.7\% of the transcripts had open reading frame (ORF). Hence, 63.4\% and 42.7\% of the ORFs were annotated using Blastp and Blastx against UniProtKB database, respectively, uncovering the presence of at least 29,273 genes in the A. angustifolia transcriptome. The six pairwise comparisons between plant tissues resulted in the identification of 123,181 differentially expressed transcripts (23,978 were upregulated and 79,203 were downregulated). Several carbohydrate metabolism pathways were significantly enriched from the comparisons between leaves and stems. Thus, genes regulated for the fructan, starch and sucrose biosynthesis were discussed. Furthermore, genes involved in cellulose synthesis were explored being the members of the cellulose synthase genes subfamily were highly expressed in young leaf, while the members of the cellulose synthase-like subfamily were preferentially expressed in mature leaf. Moreover, A. angustifolia transcriptome served for the identification of 30,766 SSR and 21,686 VNTR potential markers. Overall, the transcriptomic data generated in this study provide an invaluable resource to understand the biology of A. angustifolia, offering new insight to understand their physiology and adaptation.},

Therefore, there is considerable interest in studying the epigenetic marks present at relevant chromosomal loci. Telomeric regions, which include telomeres and subtelomeres, have been traditionally considered heterochromatic. However, whereas the heterochromatic nature of subtelomeres has been widely accepted, the epigenetic status of telomeres remains controversial. Here, we studied the epigenetic features of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) telomeres by analyzing multiple genome-wide ChIP-seq experiments. Our analyses revealed that Arabidopsis telomeres are not significantly enriched either in euchromatic marks like H3K4me2, H3K9ac, and H3K27me3 or in heterochromatic marks such as H3K27me1 and H3K9me2. Thus, telomeric regions in Arabidopsis have a bimodal chromatin organization with telomeres lacking significant levels of canonical euchromatic and heterochromatic marks followed by heterochromatic subtelomeres. Since heterochromatin is known to influence telomere function, the heterochromatic modifications present at Arabidopsis subtelomeres could play a relevant role in telomere biology.},

The aim of this study was to: 1) gain insight into the gene regulatory networks modulating leaf responses to polluted air, 2) identify possible changes in the leaf microbiome due to particulate matter in the real urban environment. The leaf transcriptome and microbiome were analyzed for Photinia x fraseri L. plants cultivated for three months in pots in two close-by areas under different levels of air PMs (low and high). PCA and heat map analysis showed that 28 differentially expressed genes in common between the three pairwise comparisons were able to clearly discriminate plants under higher PM levels. The pollutants were mainly sensed by plants through a restructuring modification of cell wall and membrane due to the main repression of lipid desaturases. In addition, high PMs showed a clear repression of genes belonging to primary metabolism pathways involved in C assimilation. Microbiome analysis showed no significant changes in taxonomic diversity indexes for the bacterial communities, whereas fungi belonging to the genera Epicoccum and Dioszegia were differently affected by the different exposure to PM levels. A model of transcriptional regulation to air PMs in plants has been proposed.},

Here we present ChiRA, a generic framework for sensitive annotation of these chimeric reads, which in turn can be used to predict the sequenced hybrids.Grouping reference loci on the basis of aligned common reads and quantification improved the handling of the multi-mapped reads in contrast to common strategies such as the selection of the longest hit or a random choice among all hits. On benchmark data ChiRA improved the number of correct alignments to the reference up to 3-fold. It is shown that the genes that belong to the common read loci share the same protein families or similar pathways. In published data, ChiRA could detect 3 times more new interactions compared to existing approaches. In addition, ChiRAViz can be used to visualize and filter large chimeric datasets intuitively.ChiRA tool suite provides a complete analysis and visualization framework along with ready-to-use Galaxy workflows and tutorials for RNA-RNA interactome and structurome datasets. Common read loci built by ChiRA can rescue multi-mapped reads on paralogous genes without requiring any information on gene relations. We showed that ChiRA is sensitive in detecting new RNA-RNA interactions from published RNA-RNA interactome datasets.},

Here, we describe the medicinal chemistry development and drug-like properties of BDM91288, a pyridylpiperazine-based AcrB efflux pump inhibitor. In vitro evaluation of BDM91288 confirmed it to potentiate the activity of a panel of antibiotics against K. pneumoniae as well as revert clinically relevant antibiotic resistance mediated by acrAB-tolC overexpression. Using cryo-EM, BDM91288 binding to the transmembrane region of K. pneumoniae AcrB was confirmed, further validating the mechanism of action of this inhibitor. Finally, proof of concept studies demonstrated that oral administration of BDM91288 significantly potentiated the in vivo efficacy of levofloxacin treatment in a murine model of K. pneumoniae lung infection.},

@article{vieira_polymyxin_2024,
 abstract = {Until 2015, polymyxin resistance was primarily attributed to chromosomal mutations. However, with the first report of mobile colistin resistance (mcr-1) in commensal Escherichia coli from food animals in China, the landscape has changed. To evaluate the presence of polymyxin resistance in Salmonella spp., a drop screening test for colistin and polymyxin B was carried out on 1156 isolates of non-human origin (animals, food, and the environment), received in Brazil, between 2016 and 2021. Subsequently, 210 isolates with resistant results in the drop test were subjected to the gold-standard test (broth microdilution) for both colistin and polymyxin B. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 102 resistant isolates was performed for a comprehensive analysis of associated genes. Surprisingly, none of the isolates resistant to colistin in the drop test harbored any of the mcr variants (mcr-1 to mcr-10). WGS identified that the most common mutations were found in pmrA (n= 22; T89S) and pmrB (n = 24; M15T, G73S, V74I, I83A, A111V). Other resistance determinants were also detected, such as the aac(6′)-Iaa gene in 72 isolates, while others carried beta-lactamase genes (blaTEM-1 blaCTX-M-2, blaCMY-2). Additionally, genes associated with fluoroquinolone resistance (qnrB19, qnrS1, oqxA/B) were detected in 11 isolates. Colistin and polymyxin B resistance were identified among Salmonella from non-human sources, but not associated with the mcr genes. Furthermore, the already-described mutations associated with polymyxin resistance were detected in only a small number of isolates, underscoring the need to explore and characterize unknown genes that contribute to resistance.},

 abstract = {Pervasive transcription originating from the ubiquitous activity of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) generates a vast mass of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that represent a potential harm to gene expression. In the compact genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the main genomewide safeguard against pervasive ncRNAs is the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, composed of two RNA-binding proteins (Nrd1 and Nab3) and the helicase Sen1. The NNS complex directs transcription termination of ncRNA genes and promotes the rapid degradation of pervasive transcripts from yeast nuclei through its physical and functional coupling to the nuclear RNA exosome. We have recently shown that inhibition of the exosome in yeast cells leads to the accumulation of ncRNAs complexed with Nab3 and Nrd1, decreasing recycling of these termination factors to sites of transcription and inducing global termination defects at NNS targets. Consistent with the notion that ncRNAs out-titrate Nab3 and Nrd1 termination factors, we have shown that a similar genomewide termination impairment could be achieved by expressing a circular RNA decoy containing a Nab3 binding target [1]. In relation to this previous research article, here we expand our observations on the effect of the circular RNA decoy on NNS termination. We aimed at verifying that the Nab3 binding sequence present on the decoy is indeed efficiently sequestering Nab3 as intended by design, leading to the expected decrease of Nab3 binding on NNS targets. We employed the crosslinking and cDNA analysis protocol (CRAC) on yeast cells expressing the circular ncRNA decoy or a control construct. We present data from high-resolution genomewide RNA binding of Nab3 in three independent biological replicates of these S.cerevisiae cells, normalized by spiked-in S.pombe lysates. These data allow the useful assessment of the extent of co-transcriptional binding decrease of Nab3 by decoy ncRNA titration and will be valuable for further analyses of NNS targeting mechanisms.},

How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance, and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation.},

Endophytes may contribute to the yield and composition of EOs, representing a useful tool for biotechnological applications. In this work, we investigated the genomic basis of this potential contribution. The annotated genomes of four endophytic strains isolated from Origanum vulgare L. were used to obtain KEGG ortholog codes, which were used for the annotation of different pathways in KEGG, and to evaluate whether endophytes might harbor the (complete) gene sets for terpene and/or plant hormone biosynthesis. All strains possessed ortholog genes for the mevalonate-independent pathway (MEP/DOXP), allowing for the production of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) precursors. Ortholog genes for the next steps in terpenoid biosynthesis were scarce. All the strains possess potential plant growth promotion (PGP) ability, as shown by the presence of orthologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of indoleacetic acid. The main contribution of endophytes to the yield and composition of O. vulgare EO very likely resides in their PGP activities and in the biosynthesis of precursors of bioactive compounds.},

Taxa in the Myrtaceae family are renowned for their diversity of terpenoid-rich essential oils, and among them, the tribe Eucalypteae has the largest TPS gene family found in any plant ({\textgreater} 100 TPS). In this study, comparative analysis of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree), from the related tribe Melaleuceae, revealed some Myrtaceae have smaller TPS families, as a total of 58 putatively functional full-length TPS genes, and 21 pseudogenes were identified by manual annotation of a newly released long-read assembly of the genome. The TPS-a and TPS-b2 subfamilies that synthesise secondary compounds often mediating plant-environment interactions were more diminutive than those in eucalypts, probably reflecting key differences in the evolutionary histories of the two lineages. Of the putatively functional TPS-b1, 13 clustered into a region of around 400 kb on one scaffold. The organisation of these TPS suggested that tandem duplication was instrumental in the evolution and diversity of terpene chemistry in Melaleuca. Four TPS-b1 likely to catalyse the synthesis of the three monoterpenoid components that are used to classify tea tree chemotypes were encoded within a single small region of 87 kb in the larger cluster of TPS-b1, raising the possibility that coregulation and linkage may lead to their behaviour as a single locus, providing an explanation for the categorical inheritance of complex multiple-component chemotypes in the taxon.},

The study presents a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of the impact of ionising radiation (IR) on barley seedlings, intending to identify candidate pathways for creating radiation-resilient barley plants. We found that different IR treatments (gamma, electron, proton, neutron) increased the intensity of protein catabolism and led to the attenuation of translation. The impact of IRs on protein synthesis and degradation was accompanied by rearrangements in energy metabolism and reallocation of nitrogen, probably due to enhanced protein catabolism. At least partially, those changes seem to fuel secondary metabolites production, including riboflavin, various phytoalexins, phytosiderophores, ferulic and sinapic acids, kaempferol, quercetin, nictoflorin, gallate, and podophyllotoxin. Many of these compounds have antioxidant or radioprotective properties. To focus on possible targets for gene editing, we identified genes differentially regulated after all types of IR exposure and potential transcription factors regulating secondary metabolism, including AP2/ERF, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, MYB, and NAC families.},

Insulator-binding proteins (IBPs) play a critical role in genome architecture by forming and maintaining contact domains. While the involvement of several IBPs in organising chromatin architecture in
Drosophila
has been described, the specific contribution of the Suppressor of Hairy wings (Su(Hw)) IBP to genome topology remains unclear. In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of long-range interactions (LRIs) between Su(Hw) and Combgap ChIP-Seq peaks, reflected in the indirect binding of these proteins to chromatin in ChIP experiments. Loss of Su(Hw) binding results in the disappearance of Su(Hw)-Combgap LRIs and a decrease in spatial self-interactions among a subset of Su(Hw) sites. Our findings suggest that Su(Hw)-Combgap LRIs are associated with active chromatin rather than Polycomb-directed repression. Furthermore, we observe that the majority of transcription start sites that are down-regulated upon loss of Su(Hw) binding to chromatin are located within 2 kb of Combgap peaks and exhibit Su(Hw)-dependent changes in Combgap and transcriptional regulators’ binding.},

 abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a persistent negative impact on both the public health and the global economy. To comprehend the origin, transmission routes and discover the mutations that alter the virus’s transmissibility and pathogenicity, full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes have to be molecularly characterized. Focusing on a two-year time frame (2020-2021), we provide an in-depth virologic and epidemiological overview of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Republic of North Macedonia by assessing the frequency and distribution of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis we shed light on the molecular evolution of the virus as well as test for a possible connection between specific SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes and the severity of the clinical symptoms. Our results show that one fifth (21.51\%) of the tested respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. A noticeable trend in the incidence and severity of the COVID-19 infections was observed in the 60+ age group between males and females. Of the total number of positive cases, the highest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was noticed in 60+ males (4,170.4/100,000), with a statistically significant (0,0001) difference between the two sexes. Additionally, a 1.8x increase in male mortality and consequentially significantly higher number of death cases was observed compared to females of the same age group (0.001). A total of 327 samples were sequenced in the period March 2020 - August 2021, showing the temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in North Macedonia. The phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the viral genomes were closely related and clustered in four distinctive lineages, B.1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2. A statistically significant difference was observed in the 2C\_1 haplotype (p=0.0013), where 10.5\% of the patients were hospitalized due to severe clinical condition. By employing genetic sequencing, coupled with epidemiological investigations, we investigated viral distribution patterns, identified emerging variants and detected vaccine breakthrough infections. The present work is the first molecular study giving a comprehensive overview of the genetic landscape of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses in North Macedonia in a period of two years.},

 abstract = {Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium found in the normal gut microbiota of diverse species, including vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as being common in the environment. It is also an opportunistic pathogen with a broad host range. One of the hosts E. faecalis can infect is the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila immune response is distinct from that of humans and interacts with E. faecalis differently. To study this interaction we carried out experimental evolution via serial passage of E. faecalis in Drosophila. We generated E. faecalis strains with much-enhanced ability to survive and proliferate within this host. Strains selected in this way are specifically resistant to the Toll-induced Bomanin family of effector peptides, resulting not only in higher E. faecalis numbers but also in a significant increase in pathogenicity. Many of these Drosophila-selected strains also exhibit marked increases or decreases in antimicrobial resistance. Whole genome sequencing showed that most selected strains carried single mutations and that many of these mutations were in genes encoding proteins known to be involved in bacterial surface characteristics and antimicrobial resistance (mprF\_2, liaF, yxdM, croS, bgsA). To test if Drosophila antimicrobial peptides kill E. faecalis using mechanisms similar to antibiotics we generated E. faecalis strains that were resistant to daptomycin. Some of these daptomycin-adapted strains also acquired resistance to the Drosophila immune response. Daptomycin-adapted E. faecalis strains have mutations in the same genes or the same regulatory systems as were observed in Drosophila-adapted strains. As common genetic mechanisms underlie the resistance of E. faecalis to daptomycin and the Drosophila immune response, these results indicate these two systems target the same conserved bacterial properties in E. faecalis. They also demonstrate that the selection and emergence of antibiotic resistance in vivo does not require antibiotic exposure.},

Advances in DNA-sequencing technologies have not only reduced the cost of sequencing but, with the advent of highly accurate long-read methods, have also enabled facile genome assembly even using mixed genomic input, thereby allowing us to more easily assess the contribution of symbionts to their insect hosts. In this study, genomic data recently generated from Peregrinus maidis was used to assemble the genome of a bacterial symbiont, Pm Arsenophonus sp. This {\textasciitilde}4.9-Mb assembly is one of the largest Arsenophonus genomes reported to date. The Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) result indicates that this Pm Arsenophonus assembly has a high degree of completeness, with 96\% of the single-copy Enterobacterales orthologs found. The identity of the Pm Arsenophonus sp. was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicates a major contribution by Pm Arsenophonus sp. to the biosynthesis of B vitamins and essential amino acids in P. maidis, where threonine and lysine production is carried out solely by Pm Arsenophonus sp. This study not only provides deeper insights into the evolutionary relationships between symbionts and their insect hosts, but also adds to our understanding of insect biology, potentially guiding the development of novel pest control methods.},

 abstract = {The regulation of plant biomass degradation by fungi is critical to the carbon cycle, and applications in bioproducts and biocontrol. Trichoderma harzianum is an important plant biomass degrader, enzyme producer, and biocontrol agent, but few putative major transcriptional regulators have been deleted in this species. The T. harzianum ortholog of the transcriptional activator XYR1/XlnR/XLR-1 was deleted, and the mutant strains were analyzed through growth profiling, enzymatic activities, and transcriptomics on cellulose. From plate cultures, the Δxyr1 mutant had reduced growth on D-xylose, xylan, and cellulose, and from shake-flask cultures with cellulose, the Δxyr1 mutant had {\textasciitilde}90\% lower β-glucosidase activity, and no detectable β-xylosidase or cellulase activity. The comparison of the transcriptomes from 18 h shake-flask cultures on D-fructose, without a carbon source, and cellulose, showed major effects of XYR1 deletion whereby the Δxyr1 mutant on cellulose was transcriptionally most similar to the cultures without a carbon source. The cellulose induced 43 plant biomass-degrading CAZymes including xylanases as well as cellulases, and most of these had massively lower expression in the Δxyr1 mutant. The expression of a subset of carbon catabolic enzymes, other transcription factors, and sugar transporters was also lower in the Δxyr1 mutant on cellulose. In summary, T. harzianum XYR1 is the master regulator of cellulases and xylanases, as well as regulating carbon catabolic enzymes.},

@article{wang_systems-level_2023,
 abstract = {Chemical modifications of transcripts with a 5′ cap occur in all organisms and function in many aspects of RNA metabolism. To facilitate analysis of RNA caps, we developed a systems-level mass spectrometry-based technique, CapQuant, for accurate and sensitive quantification of the cap epitranscriptome. The protocol includes the addition of stable isotope-labeled cap nucleotides (CNs) to RNA, enzymatic hydrolysis of endogenous RNA to release CNs, and off-line enrichment of CNs by ion-pairing high-pressure liquid chromatography, followed by a 17 min chromatography-coupled tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry run for the identification and quantification of individual CNs. The total time required for the protocol can be up to 7 d. In this approach, 26 CNs can be quantified in eukaryotic poly(A)-tailed RNA, bacterial total RNA and viral RNA. This protocol can be modified to analyze other types of RNA and RNA from in vitro sources. CapQuant stands out from other methods in terms of superior specificity, sensitivity and accuracy, and it is not limited to individual caps nor does it require radiolabeling. Thanks to its unique capability of accurately and sensitively quantifying RNA caps on a systems level, CapQuant can reveal both the RNA cap landscape and the transcription start site distribution of capped RNA in a broad range of settings.},

The cell cycle phase is a major contributor to gene expression variance between cells and computational analysis tools have been developed to assign cell cycle phases to cells within scRNAseq datasets. Whilst these tools can be extremely useful, all have the drawback that they classify cells as only G1, S or G2/M. Existing discrete cell phase assignment tools are unable to differentiate between G2 and M and continuous-phase-assignment tools are unable to identify a region corresponding specifically to mitosis in a pseudo-timeline for continuous assignment along the cell cycle. In this study, bulk RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes between mitotic and interphase cells isolated based on phospho-histone H3 expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These gene lists were used to develop a methodology which can distinguish G2 and M phase cells in scRNAseq datasets. The phase assignment tools present in Seurat were modified to allow for cell cycle phase assignment of all stages of the cell cycle to identify a mitotic-specific cell population.},

@article{weber_histone_2023,
 abstract = {The lysine acetyltransferase KAT6A (MOZ, MYST3) belongs to the MYST family of chromatin regulators, facilitating histone acetylation. Dysregulation of KAT6A has been implicated in developmental syndromes and the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous work suggests that KAT6A is recruited to its genomic targets by a combinatorial function of histone binding PHD fingers, transcription factors and chromatin binding interaction partners. Here, we demonstrate that a winged helix (WH) domain at the very N-terminus of KAT6A specifically interacts with unmethylated CpG motifs. This DNA binding function leads to the association of KAT6A with unmethylated CpG islands (CGIs) genome-wide. Mutation of the essential amino acids for DNA binding completely abrogates the enrichment of KAT6A at CGIs. In contrast, deletion of a second WH domain or the histone tail binding PHD fingers only subtly influences the binding of KAT6A to CGIs. Overexpression of a KAT6A WH1 mutant has a dominant negative effect on H3K9 histone acetylation, which is comparable to the effects upon overexpression of a KAT6A HAT domain mutant. Taken together, our work revealed a previously unrecognized chromatin recruitment mechanism of KAT6A, offering a new perspective on the role of KAT6A in gene regulation and human diseases.},

 abstract = {Rett syndrome is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is mainly caused by mutations in MECP2. However, mutations in FOXG1 cause a less frequent form of atypical Rett syndrome, called FOXG1 syndrome. FOXG1 is a key transcription factor crucial for forebrain development, where it maintains the balance between progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Using genome-wide small RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics, we identified that FOXG1 affects the biogenesis of miR200b/a/429 and interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, DDX5/p68. Both FOXG1 and DDX5 associate with the microprocessor complex, whereby DDX5 recruits FOXG1 to DROSHA. RNA-Seq analyses of Foxg1cre/+ hippocampi and N2a cells overexpressing miR200 family members identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR2B) as a target of miR200 in neural cells. PRKAR2B inhibits postsynaptic functions by attenuating protein kinase A (PKA) activity; thus, increased PRKAR2B levels may contribute to neuronal dysfunctions in FOXG1 syndrome. Our data suggest that FOXG1 regulates PRKAR2B expression both on transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.},

 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies worldwide with an urgent need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. One major risk factor for PDAC is the pre-indication of chronic pancreatitis (CP), which represents highly inflammatory pancreatic tissue. Kallikreins (KLKs) are secreted serine proteases that play an important role in various cancers as components of the tumor microenvironment. Previous studies of KLKs in solid tumors largely relied on either transcriptomics or immunodetection. We present one of the first targeted mass spectrometry profiling of kallikrein proteases in PDAC, CP, and normal pancreas. We show that KLK6 and KLK10 are significantly upregulated in PDAC (n=14) but not in CP (n=7) when compared to normal pancreas (n=16), highlighting their specific intertwining with malignancy. Additional explorative proteome profiling identified 5936 proteins in our pancreatic cohort and observed disease-specific proteome rearrangements in PDAC and CP. As such, PDAC features an enriched proteome motif for extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion while there is depletion of mitochondrial energy metabolism proteins, reminiscent of the Warburg effect. Although often regarded as a PDAC hallmark, the ECM fingerprint was also observed in CP, alongside with a prototypical inflammatory proteome motif as well as with an increased wound healing process and proteolytic activity, thereby possibly illustrating tissue autolysis. Proteogenomic analysis based on publicly accessible data sources identified 112 PDAC-specific and 32 CP-specific single amino acid variants, which among others affect KRAS and ANKHD1. Our study emphasizes the diagnostic potential of kallikreins and provides novel insights into proteomic characteristics of PDAC and CP.},

In this study, we assessed the duration of rectal ESBL- producing E. coli colonisation in the residents, and compare duration of colonisation for ESBL-ST131 versus ESBL-non-ST131.MethodsRectal or faecal samples were obtained from residents of nursing home A between 2013 and 2019 and nursing home B between 2017 and 2019, with repeated point prevalence surveys at intervals of three to six months. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of E. coli were identified on selective culture and selective\&amp;nbsp;enrichment\&amp;nbsp;broth, and examined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In nursing home A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and cluster analyse was performed by respectively O25:ST131-specific PCR and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). In nursing home B whole genome sequencing data were used to determine MLST and to perform a cluster analyse. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed to calculate the median time of rectal colonisation of ESBL-EC with a Log-Rank analysis to test for differences between ESBL-ST131 and ESBL-non-ST131.ResultsA total of 144 residents were included: 84 residents (58\%) with ESBL-ST131 rectal colonisation and 60 residents (42\%) with ESBL-non-ST131 rectal colonisation. Survival analysis showed a median colonisation length of 13 months for ESBL-ST131 (95\%CI: 7,2 – 18,7) versus 8,3 months (95\%CI: 2,8 – 13,8) for ESBL-non-ST131 (p = 0,028). Remarkably, in the subgroup ST131 the median colonisation length was significantly longer in female than in males: 25,7 months versus 8,1 months (p = 0,013).ConclusionHere we found a prolonged colonisation duration of ESBL-ST131 compared to ESBL-non-ST131 in residents of Dutch nursing homes. Prolonged colonisation duration complicates the controlling and ending an ESBL-ST131 outbreak, especially in long stay settings such as nursing homes.\&amp;nbsp;},

Broader adoption of eDNA analysis will produce many well-recognized benefits for pathogen surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, endangered and invasive species detection, and population genetics. Here we show that deep-sequencing-based eDNA approaches capture genomic information from humans (Homo sapiens) just as readily as that from the intended target species. We term this phenomenon human genetic bycatch (HGB). Additionally, high-quality human eDNA could be intentionally recovered from environmental substrates (water, sand and air), holding promise for beneficial medical, forensic and environmental applications. However, this also raises ethical dilemmas, from consent, privacy and surveillance to data ownership, requiring further consideration and potentially novel regulation. We present evidence that human eDNA is readily detectable from ‘wildlife’ environmental samples as human genetic bycatch, demonstrate that identifiable human DNA can be intentionally recovered from human-focused environmental sampling and discuss the translational and ethical implications of such findings.},

The de.NBI provides (i) service, (ii) training, and (iii) cloud computing to users in life sciences research and biomedicine in Germany and Europe and (iv) fosters the cooperation of the German bioinformatics community with international network structures. The de.NBI members also run the German node (ELIXIR-DE) within the European ELIXIR network. The de.NBI / ELIXIR-DE training platform, also known as special interest group 3 (SIG 3) ‘Training \& Education’, coordinates the bioinformatics training of de.NBI and the German ELIXIR node. The network provides a high-quality, coherent, timely, and impactful training program across its eight service centers. Life scientists learn how to handle and analyze biological big data more effectively by applying tools, standards and compute services provided by de.NBI. Since 2015, more than 250 training courses were carried out with more than 5,200 participants and these courses received recommendation rates of almost 90\% (status as of October 2019). In addition to face-to-face training courses, online training was introduced on the de.NBI website in 2016 and guidelines for the preparation of e-learning material were established in 2018. In 2016, ELIXIR-DE joined the ELIXIR training platform. Here, the de.NBI / ELIXIR-DE training platform collaborates with ELIXIR in training activities, advertising training courses via TeSS and discussions on the exchange of data for training events essential for quality assessment on both the technical and administrative levels. The de.NBI training program trained thousands of scientists from Germany and beyond in many different areas of bioinformatics.},

 abstract = {Histone acetylation regulates gene expression, cell function and cell fate1. Here we study the pattern of histone acetylation in the epithelial tissue of the Drosophila wing disc. H3K18ac, H4K8ac and total lysine acetylation are increased in the outer rim of the disc. This acetylation pattern is controlled by nuclear position, whereby nuclei continuously move from apical to basal locations within the epithelium and exhibit high levels of H3K18ac when they are in proximity to the tissue surface. These surface nuclei have increased levels of acetyl-CoA synthase, which generates the acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation. The carbon source for histone acetylation in the rim is fatty acid β-oxidation, which is also increased in the rim. Inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation causes H3K18ac levels to decrease in the genomic proximity of genes involved in disc development. In summary, there is a physical mark of the outer rim of the wing and other imaginal epithelia in Drosophila that affects gene expression.},

 abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables the unbiased characterization of surfaces with respect to their chemical composition. In biological MSI, zones with differentialmass profiles hint towards localized physiological processes, such as the tissue-specific accumulation of secondary metabolites, or diseases, such as cancer. Thus, the efficientdiscovery of ‘regions of interest’ (ROI) is of utmost importance in MSI. However, often the discovery of ROIs is hampered by high background noise and artifact signals. Especially in ambient ionization MSI, unmasking biologically relevant information from crude data sets is challenging. Therefore, we implemented a Threshold Intensity Quantization (TrIQ) algorithm for augmenting the contrast in MSI data visualizations. The simple algorithm reduces the impact of extreme values (‘outliers’) and rescales the dynamic range of mass signals. We provide an R script for post-processing MSI data in the imzML community format (https://bitbucket.org/lababi/msi.r) and implemented the TrIQ in our open-source imaging software RmsiGUI (https://bitbucket.org/lababi/rmsigui/). Applying these programs to different biological MSI data sets demonstrated the universal applicability of TrIQ for improving the contrast in the MSI data visualization. We show that TrIQ improves a subsequent detection of ROIs by sectioning. In addition, the adjustment of the dynamic signal intensity range makes MSI data sets comparable.},

 abstract = {Microalgal biomass is an alternative feedstock for biogas production although its C/N ratio is usually lower than optimal, therefore co-fermentation is recommended. Identification of the core microbiome by metagenome analysis and prediction of functional characteristics are essential to make microalgal feedstock more sustainable and economically feasible. Biogas production from photoautotrophically grown Chlorella vulgaris (Ch. vulgaris) biomass (240 mL CH4 g oTS-1) and co-fermentation with maize silage (330 mL CH4 g oTS-1) has been studied in semi continuous laboratory biogas fermenters. Maize silage control yielded 310 mL CH4 g oTS-1. The microbial community and the read-based functional profiles, derived from these data, were examined during the process by using next-generation metagenome Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The read-based core microbiome consisted of 92 genera from which 60 abundant taxa were directly associated with the microbial methane producing food chain. The data-set was also analyzed in a genome-based approach. 65 bins were assembled, 52 of them belonged in the core biogas producing genera identified by the read-based metagenomes. The read-based and genome-based approaches complemented and verified each other. The functional profiles indicated a variety of glycoside hydrolases. Substantial rearrangements of the methanogen functions have also been observed. Co-fermentation of algal biomass and plant biomass can be carried out for an extended period of time without process failure. The microbial members of the inoculum are well conserved, feedstock composition cause relative abundance changes in the core microbiome.},

The use of liquid wastes as nutrient clearly improves the sustainability of microalgal biofuel production. Microalgae and bacteria have an ecological inter-kingdom relationship. This microenvironment called phycosphere has a major role in the ecosystem productivity and can be utilized both in bioremediation and biomass production. However, knowledge on the effects of indigenous bacteria on microalgal growth and the characteristics of bacterial communities associated with microalgae are limited. In this study municipal, industrial and agricultural liquid waste derivatives were used as cultivation media. Chlorella vulgaris green microalgae and its bacterial partners efficiently metabolized the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content available in these wastes. The read-based metagenomics approach revealed a diverse microbial composition at the start point of cultivations in the different types of liquid wastes. The relative abundance of the observed taxa significantly changed over the cultivation period. The genome-centric reconstruction of phycospheric bacteria further explained the observed correlations between the taxonomic composition and biomass yield of the various waste-based biodegradation systems. Functional profile investigation of the reconstructed microbes revealed a variety of relevant biological processes like organic acid oxidation and vitamin B synthesis. Thus, liquid wastes were shown to serve as valuable resources of nutrients as well as of growth promoting bacteria enabling increased microalgal biomass production.},

 abstract = {IntroductionChronic heart failure is associated with adverse remodeling of the heart that is typically characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This requires the formation of new capillaries to maintain oxygen supply. Insufficient angiogenesis promotes the transition from compensated hypertrophy into heart failure. The aim of the present study was to identify angiogenesis-related gene networks and corresponding regulatory hubs in endothelial cells from failing human hearts.Methods and resultsWe isolated left ventricular endothelial cells from patients with advanced heart failure undergoing left ventricular assist device surgery (n = 15) and healthy organ donors (n = 2) and performed RNA sequencing. Subgroup analysis revealed no impact of co-morbidities on gene expression. In a weighted coexpression network analysis, we found 26 gene clusters, of which nine clusters showed a significant positive or negative correlation with the presence of heart failure. We identified the transcription factors CASZ1 (castor zinc finger 1), ZNF523 (zinc finger protein 523), and NFE2L1 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1) as hub genes of a cluster related to angiogenesis. Knock-down of CASZ1, ZNF523, or NFE2L1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells led to a downregulation of genes from the respective cluster, including CD34 and platelet derived growth factor β, confirming their regulatory function.ConclusionIn conclusion, we assessed gene networks in endothelial cells and identified transcription factors CASZ1, ZNF532, and NFE2L1 as potential regulators of angiogenesis in failing human hearts. Our study provides insights into the transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis beyond the classical vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway.},

 abstract = {The malaria parasite replicates asexually in the red blood cells of its vertebrate host employing epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression in response to changes in its environment. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing in conjunction with RNA sequencing to create an epigenomic and transcriptomic map of the developmental transition from asexual blood stages to male and female gametocytes and to ookinetes in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Across the developmental stages examined, heterochromatin protein 1 associates with variantly expressed gene families localised at subtelomeric regions and variant gene expression based on heterochromatic silencing is observed only in some genes. Conversely, the euchromatin mark histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) is abundant in non-heterochromatic regions across all developmental stages. H3K9ac presents a distinct pattern of enrichment around the start codon of ribosomal protein genes in all stages but male gametocytes. Additionally, H3K9ac occupancy positively correlates with transcript abundance in all stages but female gametocytes suggesting that transcription in this stage is independent of H3K9ac levels. This finding together with known mRNA repression in female gametocytes suggests a multilayered mechanism operating in female gametocytes in preparation for fertilization and zygote development, coinciding with parasite transition from host to vector.},

 abstract = {Microglia are the tissue-resident macrophages of the retina and brain, being critically involved in organ development, tissue homeostasis, and response to cellular damage. Until now, little is known about the molecular signature of human retinal microglia and how it differs from the one of brain microglia and peripheral monocytes. In addition, it is not yet clear to what extent murine retinal microglia resemble those of humans, which represents an important prerequisite for translational research. The present study applies fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate human retinal microglia from enucleated eyes and compares their transcriptional profile with the one of whole retinal tissue, human brain microglia as well as classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Finally, human retinal microglia are compared to murine retinal microglia, isolated from Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice. Whereas human retinal microglia exhibited a high grade of similarity in comparison to their counterparts in the brain, several enriched genes were identified in retinal microglia when compared to whole retinal tissue, as well as classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes. In relation to whole retina sequencing, several risk genes associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) were preferentially expressed in retinal microglia, indicating their potential pathophysiological involvement. Although a high degree of similarity was observed between human and murine retinal microglia, several species-specific genes were identified, which should be kept in mind when employing mouse models to investigate retinal microglia biology. In summary, this study provides detailed insights into the molecular profile of human retinal microglia, identifies a plethora of tissue-specific and species-specific genes in comparison to human brain microglia and murine retinal microglia, and thus highlights the significance of retinal microglia in human retinal diseases and for translational research approaches.},

@article{wolf_corneal_2020,
 abstract = {Purpose
Immune reactions following corneal transplantation are the most common cause of transplant failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of corneal graft rejection are not yet fully understood but increasing evidence points to a crucial role of the innate immune system in this context. Using a human in vitro model, we aimed to assess the response of human macrophages to stimulation with human corneal tissue and whether corneal endothelial cells (CEC) have immune-modulating properties.
Methods
Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). A standardized protocol was used for disaggregation of human corneas into fragments of defined sizes. MDMs were stimulated using processed corneal material with or without CEC. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-gamma (IFNγ) served as controls. RNA sequencing was applied to analyze the impact of differential stimulation of MDMs on their transcriptional profile. RNA sequencing results were validated using digital PCR.
Results
The transcriptional profile of MDMs was significantly modulated by the type of stimulus used for MDM activation as well as by the individual MDM donor. LPS- or IFNγ-stimulation resulted in distinct transcriptional alterations compared to unstimulated MDMs including an upregulation of various cytokines such as CCL3, 4, 5, 19 or CXCL9. Corneal tissue induced the differential expression of 45 genes when compared to unstimulated MDMs, with several metallothioneins (MTs) among the upregulated factors (MT1A, MT1E, MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, MT1L, MT1M, MT1X, MT2A). This effect was independent of the presence or absence of CEC. PCR validation confirmed induction of 3 different metallothioneins (MT1G, MT1H and MT2A) in MDMs stimulated by corneal tissue.
Conclusions
The MDM in vitro model proved to be a robust tool to study the effects of LPS, IFNγ and corneal tissue homogenates on the transcriptional activity of MDM. Human macrophages showed a distinct upregulation of various MTs when challenged with human corneal allogen with or without corneal endothelium, which might have an immune-modulatory effect. As a general observation, it appears that in MDM-based studies a significant donor-dependent effect on the transcriptional profile of MDMs needs to be considered and adjusted before downstream analysis.},

 abstract = {Hyalocytes are the tissue-resident innate immune cell population of the vitreous body with important functions in health and vitreoretinal disease. The purpose of this study is to gain new insights into the biology and function of human hyalocytes in comparison to other innate immune cells.    The present study applies fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptional profiles of human hyalocytes, retinal microglia (rMG) and classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes isolated from the same patients. Immunohistochemistry was applied for morphological characterization of human hyalocytes.    Pairwise analysis indicates distinct differences between hyalocytes and monocytes, whereas a high degree of similarity to rMG is apparent, with comparable expression levels of established microglia markers, such as TREM2, P2RY12, and TMEM119. Among the top expressed genes in hyalocytes, SPP1, CD74, and C3, were significantly upregulated when compared with monocytes. Despite the high level of similarity of hyalocytes and rMG, ten highly expressed genes in hyalocytes compared to microglia were identified, among them FOS, DUSP1, and EGR2.    This study reveals a high degree of similarity between hyalocytes and retinal microglia. Nevertheless, hyalocytes exhibit some expression differences that may adapt them to the specific needs of the vitreous and provide the basis for deciphering the multiple roles of this fascinating cell population in health and vitreoretinal diseases.},

Eight healthy conjunctival specimens served as controls. The TME of CM, as determined by bioinformatic cell type enrichment analysis, was characterized by the enrichment of melanocytes, pericytes and especially various immune cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, B cells and mast cells. Differentially expressed genes between CM and control were mainly involved in inhibition of apoptosis, proteolysis and response to growth factors. POU3F3, BIRC5 and 7 were among the top expressed genes associated with inhibition of apoptosis. 20 genes, among them CENPK, INHA, USP33, CASP3, SNORA73B, AAR2, SNRNP48 and GPN1, were identified as prognostically relevant factors reaching high classification accuracy (area under the curve: 1.0). The present study provides new insights into the TME and the transcriptional profile of CM and additionally identifies new prognostic biomarkers. These results add new diagnostic tools and may lead to new options of targeted therapy for CM.},

Ten formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded conjunctival EMZL and eight healthy conjunctival specimens were analyzed by Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. The 3417 upregulated genes in conjunctival EMZL were involved in processes such as B cell proliferation and Rac protein signaling, whereas the 1188 downregulated genes contributed most significantly to oxidative phosphorylation and UV protection. The tumor microenvironment, as determined by deconvolution analysis, was mainly composed of multiple B cell subtypes which reflects the tumor’s B cell lineage. However, several T cell types, including T helper 2 cells and regulatory T cells, as well as innate immune cell types, such as anti-inflammatory macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, were also strongly enriched in conjunctival EMZL. A 13-biomarker prognostic panel, including S100A8 and S100A9, classified ocular and extraocular tumor recurrence, exceeded prognostic accuracy of Ann Arbor and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging, and demonstrated prognostic value for patient survival in 21 different cancer types in a database of 12,332 tumor patients. These findings may lead to new options of targeted therapy and may improve prognostic prediction for conjunctival EMZL.},

Worldwide research efforts have identified numerous ncRNAs and multiple RNA subtypes, which are attributed to diverse functionalities known to interact with different functional layers, from DNA and RNA to proteins. This makes the prediction of functions for newly identified ncRNAs challenging. Current bioinformatics and systems biology approaches show promising results to facilitate an identification of these diverse ncRNA functionalities. Here, we review (a) current experimental protocols, i.e., for Next Generation Sequencing, for a successful identification of ncRNAs; (b) sequencing data analysis workflows as well as available computational environments; and (c) state-of-the-art approaches to functionally characterize ncRNAs, e.g., by means of transcriptome-wide association studies, molecular network analyses, or artificial intelligence guided prediction. In addition, we present a strategy to cover the identification and functional characterization of unknown transcripts by using connective workflows.},

As a pioneer in planctomycetal research, he isolated numerous strains belonging to the phylum Planctomycetota from aquatic habitats around the world. Phylogenetic analyses show that strain SH412T belongs to the family Planctomycetaceae and shares with 91.6\% the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Planctopirus limnophila DSM 3776T. Its genome has a length of 7.3 Mb and a G + C content of 63.6\%. Optimal growth of strain SH412T occurs at pH 7.0–7.5 and 28 °C with its pigmentation depending on sunlight exposure. Strain SH412T reproduces by polar asymmetric division (“budding”) and forms ovoid cells. The cell size determination was performed using a semi-automatic pipeline, which we first evaluated with the model species P. limnophila and then applied to strain SH412T. Furthermore, the data acquired during time-lapse analyses suggests a lifestyle switch from flagellated daughter cells to non-flagellated mother cells in the subsequent cycle. Based on our data, we suggest that strain SH412T represents a novel species within a novel genus, for which we propose the name Planctoellipticum variicoloris gen. nov., sp. nov., with strain SH412T (= CECT 30430T = STH00996T, the STH number refers to the Jena Microbial Resource Collection JMRC) as the type strain of the new species.},

 abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important uropathogen that increasingly harbors broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance determinants. Evidence suggests that some same-strain recurrences in women with frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) may emanate from a persistent intravesicular reservoir. Our objective was to analyze K. pneumoniae isolates collected over weeks from multiple body sites of a single patient with recurrent UTI in order to track ordered strain progression across body sites, as has been employed across patients in outbreak settings. Whole-genome sequencing of 26 K. pneumoniae isolates was performed utilizing the Illumina platform. PacBio sequencing was used to create a refined reference genome of the original urinary isolate (TOP52). Sequence variation was evaluated by comparing the 26 isolate sequences to the reference genome sequence. Whole-genome sequencing of the K. pneumoniae isolates from six different body sites of this patient with recurrent UTI demonstrated 100\% chromosomal sequence identity of the isolates, with only a small P2 plasmid deletion in a minority of isolates. No single nucleotide variants were detected. The complete absence of single-nucleotide variants from 26 K. pneumoniae isolates from multiple body sites collected over weeks from a patient with recurrent UTI suggests that, unlike in an outbreak situation with strains collected from numerous patients, other methods are necessary to discern strain progression within a single host over a relatively short time frame.},

Indirect disruption of the electron transport chain by gene editing of SLC25A mitochondrial membrane transporters as well as direct genetic and pharmacological disruption of either complexes I, III, or the copper-containing complex IV of the electron transport chain elicited upregulation of APOE transcript, protein, and secretion, up to 49-fold. These APOE phenotypes were robustly expressed in diverse cell types and iPSC-derived human astrocytes as part of an inflammatory gene expression program. Moreover, age- and genotype-dependent decline in brain levels of respiratory complex I preceded an increase in APOE in the 5xFAD mouse model.

However, few studies have reported its presence in mixed microbial communities and its trigger mechanism in the natural environment and engineered systems. Here, we reported DIET-like mutualism of Geobacter and methanogens in the planktonic microbiome for the first time in anaerobic electrochemical digestion (AED) fed with propionate, potentially triggered by excessive cathodic hydrogen (56 times higher than the lowest) under the electrochemical condition. In contrast with model prediction without DIET, the highest current density and hydrogen and methane production were concurrently observed at −0.2 V where an abundance of Geobacter (49\%) and extracellular electron transfer genes were identified in the planktonic microbiome via metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic assembly genomes annotated to Geobacter anodireducens were identified alongside two methanogens, Methanothrix harundinacea and Methanosarcina mazei, which were previously identified to participate in DIET. This discovery revealed that DIET-like mutualism could be triggered without external conductive materials, highlighting its potentially ubiquitous presence. Such mutualism simultaneously boosted methane and hydrogen production, thereby demonstrating the potential of AED in engineering applications.},

To understand the transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium, the small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA and gp60 genes are commonly studied through PCR analysis and conventional Sanger sequencing. However, analyzing sequence chromatograms manually is both time consuming and prone to human error, especially in the presence of poorly resolved, heterozygous peaks and the absence of a validated database. For this study, we developed a Cryptosporidium genotyping tool, called CryptoGenotyper, which has the capability to read raw Sanger sequencing data for the two common Cryptosporidium gene targets (SSU rRNA and gp60) and classify the sequence data into standard nomenclature. The CryptoGenotyper has the capacity to perform quality control and properly classify sequences using a high quality, manually curated reference database, saving users' time and removing bias during data analysis. The incorporated heterozygous base calling algorithms for the SSU rRNA gene target resolves double peaks, therefore recovering data previously classified as inconclusive. The CryptoGenotyper successfully genotyped 99.3\% (428/431) and 95.1\% (154/162) of SSU rRNA chromatograms containing single and mixed sequences, respectively, and correctly subtyped 95.6\% (947/991) of gp60 chromatograms without manual intervention. This new, user-friendly tool can provide both fast and reproducible analyses of Sanger sequencing data for the two most common Cryptosporidium gene targets.},

We show that wastewater genomics can support SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological investigations by reliably recovering the prevalence of local circulating variants, even when clinical samples are not available.

 abstract = {Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are a large and diverse group of fungi, which may switch from a saprotrophic to a predatory livestyle if nematodes are present. Different fungi have developed different trapping devices, ranging from adhesive cells to constricting rings. After trapping, fungal hyphae penetrate the worm, secrete lytic enzymes and form a hyphal network inside the body. We sequenced the genome of Duddingtonia flagrans, a biotechnologically important NTF used to control nematode populations in fields. The 36.64 Mb genome encodes 9,927 putative proteins, among which are more than 638 predicted secreted proteins. Most secreted proteins are lytic enzymes, but more than 200 were classified as small secreted proteins ({\textless} 300 amino acids). 117 putative effector proteins were predicted, suggesting interkingdom communication during the colonization. As a first step to analyze the function of such proteins or other phenomena at the molecular level, we developed a transformation system, established the fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry, adapted an assay to monitor protein secretion, and established gene-deletion protocols using homologous recombination or CRISPR/Cas9. One putative effector protein, PefB, was transcriptionally induced during the interaction. We show that the mature protein is able to be imported into nuclei in C. elegans cells. In addition, we studied trap formation and show that cell-to-cell communication is required for ring closure. The availability of the genome sequence and the establishment of many molecular tools will open new avenues to studying this biotechnologically relevant nematode-trapping fungus.},

However, the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF complexes recognize their target loci in plants are not fully understood. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana bromodomain-containing proteins BRD1, BRD2, and BRD13 are core subunits of SWI/SNF complexes and critical for SWI/SNF genomic targeting. These three BRDs interact directly with multiple SWI/SNF subunits, including the BRAHMA (BRM) catalytic subunit. Phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses of the brd1 brd2 brd13 triple mutant revealed that these BRDs act largely redundantly to control gene expression and developmental processes that are also regulated by BRM. Genome-wide occupancy profiling demonstrated that these three BRDs extensively colocalize with BRM on chromatin. Simultaneous loss of function of three BRD genes results in reduced BRM protein levels and decreased occupancy of BRM on chromatin across the genome. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the bromodomains of BRDs are essential for genomic targeting of the BRD subunits of SWI/SNF complexes to their target sites. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BRD1, BRD2, and BRD13 are core subunits of SWI/SNF complexes and reveal their biological roles in facilitating genomic targeting of BRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes in plants.},

@article{yuan_ezh2_2022,
 abstract = {Inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases, but the epigenetic mechanism controlling its activation remains elusive. Here, we found that the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 mediates the activation of multiple types of inflammasomes in macrophages/microglia independent of its methyltransferase activity and thus promotes inflammasome-related pathologies. Mechanistically, Ezh2 functions through its SANT2 domain to maintain the enrichment of H3K27 acetylation in the promoter region of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Neat1, thereby promoting chromatin accessibility and facilitating p65-mediated transcription of Neat1, which is a critical mediator of inflammasome assembly and activation. In addition, the tumour suppressor protein p53 competes with Ezh2 for the same binding region in the Neat1 promoter and thus antagonises Ezh2-induced Neat1 transcription and inflammasome activation. Therefore, loss of Ezh2 strongly promotes the binding of p53, which recruits the deacetylase SIRT1 for H3K27 deacetylation of the Neat1 promoter and thus suppresses Neat1 transcription and inflammasome activation. Overall, our study demonstrates an epigenetic mechanism involved in modulating inflammasome activation through an Ezh2/p53 competition model and highlights a novel function of Ezh2 in maintaining H3K27 acetylation to support lncRNA Neat1 transcription.},

Scutellaria baicalensis, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, harbors bioactive compounds with promising pharmacological properties, including potential EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition. In this study, we employed a comprehensive approach merging cheminformatics and molecular docking techniques to investigate the glioblastoma multiforme inhibitory potentials of the bioactive compounds from the plant, with a focus against EGFR. Our findings revealed significant binding affinities ranging from −9.010 to −6.427 kcal/mol and intricate molecular interactions between compounds from S. baicalensis and the EGFR. Notably, Ganhuangenin, 5,7,2′,5′-tetrahydroxyflavone, (2R)-2-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromene-5,7-diol, and tenaxin I showed particularly high binding affinities, with scores ranging from −9.010 to −8.649 kcal/mol. These compounds even outperformed erlotinib, a standard ligand with a score of −8.539 kcal/mol. Importantly, they interacted with key amino acid residues (Met769, Glu738, and Thr766) through hydrogen bonding. These interactions were driven by specific structural features, including aromatic rings, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and hydrophobic interactions and the reliability of these results was further confirmed through induced-fit docking, reinforcing the potential inhibitory effects of these compounds on the flexible protein. Additionally, all of the top-scoring compounds from S. baicalensis adhered to established drug-likeness rules, including Lipinski's criteria, Ghose's rules, Veber's guidelines, and Egan's rules. However, it's worth noting that scutellarin had some violations in these rules. Remarkably, none of the identified compounds were likely to cause hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, or cytotoxicity, suggesting that they could be considered as safe candidates for anti-cancer agents. This multidisciplinary investigation bridges traditional herbal knowledge and modern drug discovery, offering insights into the potential of S. baicalensis bioactive compounds as novel EGFR-targeting agents. The results underscore the value of chemoinformatics and molecular docking studies in exploring natural compounds for cancer therapy, paving the way for further research in the field.},

This study identifies four OBPs of F. occidentalis and analyses their expression at three stages of growth: larvae, adult males and adult females. Further, it investigates the presence of conserved motifs and their phylogenetic relationship to other insect species. Moreover, FoccOBP3 was in silico characterized to analyse its structure along with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to understand its binding with semiochemicals of F. occidentalis. Molecular docking revealed the interactions of methyl isonicotinate, p-anisaldehyde and (S)-(-)-verbenone with FoccOBP3. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations showed bonding stability of these ligands with FoccOBP3, and field trials validated that Lurem TR (commercial product) and p-anisaldehyde had greater attraction as compared to (S)-(-)-verbenone, given the compound’s binding with FoccOBP3. The current study helps in understanding the tertiary structure and interaction of FoccOBP3 with lures using computational and field data and will help in the identification of novel lures of insects in the future, given the importance of binding with OBPs.

 abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, particularly the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have shown that MAPK signaling pathway can influence the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), known for its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative diseases. This study explores the modulation of MMP-9 expression via the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade and its potential therapeutic implications in the context of PD-associated motor dysfunction. Here, tolperisone hydrochloride (TL), a muscle relaxant that blocks voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, was used as a treatment to observe its effect on MAPK signaling and MMP-9 expression. Rotenone (RT) exposure in mice resulted in a significant reduction in substantia nigra and primary motor cortex neurons, which were further evidenced by impairments in motor function. When TL was administered, neuron count was restored (89.0 ± 4.78 vs 117.0 ± 4.46/mm2), and most of the motor dysfunction was alleviated. Mechanistically, TL reduced the protein expression of phospho-p38MAPK (1.06 fold vs 1.00 fold) and phospho-ERK1/2 (1.16 fold vs 1.02 fold), leading to the inhibition of MAPK signaling, as well as reduced MMP-9 concentrations (2.76 ± 0.10 vs 1.94 ± 0.10 ng/mL) in the process of rescuing RT-induced neuronal cell death and motor dysfunction. Computational analysis further revealed TL’s potential inhibitory properties against MMP-9 along with N and L-type calcium channels. These findings shed light on TL's neuroprotective effects via MMP-9 inhibition and MAPK signaling downregulation, offering potential therapeutic avenues for PD-associated motor dysfunction.},

 abstract = {Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of the waterborne zoonotic disease leptospirosis. Leptospira are challenged by numerous adverse conditions, including deadly reactive oxygen species (ROS), when infecting their hosts. Withstanding ROS produced by the host innate immunity is an important strategy evolved by pathogenic Leptospira for persisting in and colonizing hosts. In L. interrogans, genes encoding defenses against ROS are repressed by the peroxide stress regulator, PerR. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize both the L. interrogans response to low and high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the PerR regulon. We showed that Leptospira solicit three main peroxidase machineries (catalase, cytochrome C peroxidase and peroxiredoxin) and heme to detoxify oxidants produced during peroxide stress. In addition, canonical molecular chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins from the SOS response were required for Leptospira recovering from oxidative damage. Identification of the PerR regulon upon exposure to H2O2 allowed to define the contribution of this regulator in the oxidative stress response. This study has revealed a PerR-independent regulatory network involving other transcriptional regulators, two-component systems and sigma factors as well as non-coding RNAs that putatively orchestrate, in concert with PerR, the oxidative stress response. We have shown that PerR-regulated genes encoding a TonB-dependent transporter and a two-component system (VicKR) are involved in Leptospira tolerance to superoxide. This could represent the first defense mechanism against superoxide in L. interrogans, a bacterium lacking canonical superoxide dismutase. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenic Leptospira to overcome oxidative damage during infection-related conditions. This will participate in framing future hypothesis-driven studies to identify and decipher novel virulence mechanisms in this life-threatening pathogen.},

The 16S rRNA gene sequence was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) method from peat soil DNA sampled from secondary forest and burned areas in the Giam Siak Kecil Biosphere Reserve, Bukit Batu (GSK-BB). BKS candidates were selected from a phylogenetic tree constructed by using MEGA version 6.06. Selected BKS was in the same cluster as secondary forest and were re-selected using BLASTn: AlignTwo or More Sequence analysis to ensure the uniqueness of the sequences. Based on the selected candidates, specific primers were designed to amplify the 16S rRNA BKS gene. Sensitivity was tested in silico using FastPCR application to ensure that candidates were only in secondary forest. There were 19 BKS candidates found in the secondary forest and not in burnt land (BKS\_SFB) that were classified into three groups. Based on the in silico PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using the designed primer, we obtained two high specificity BKS candidates, i.e. BKS SFB2 (455 bp) and BKS SFB3 (473 bp).

Genome-mining revealed numerous putative biosynthetic gene clusters that code for virulence factors and fungal toxins. The presence of the enzyme pisatin demethylase was indicative of the potential of Phain to detoxify its environment from the terpenoid phytoalexins produced by its host as a defense mechanism. Proteomic analysis revealed the potential survival strategies of Phain under the snow, which included the production of antifreeze proteins, trehalose synthesis enzymes, desaturases, proteins related to elongation of very long-chain fatty acids, and stress protein responses. Study of protein GH11 endoxylanase expressed in Escherichia coli showed an acidic optimum pH (pH 5.0) and a low optimum temperature (45 °C), which is reflective of the living conditions of the fungus. Mass spectrometry analysis of the methanol extract of Phain, incubated at − 3 °C and 22 °C, revealed differences in the produced metabolites. Both genomic and mass spectrometry analyses showed the ability of Phain to adapt its metabolic processes and secretome to freezing temperatures through the production of osmoprotectant and cryoprotectant metabolites.

@article{zhang_complete_2024,
 abstract = {There has been debate about whether individuals with different color phenotypes should have different taxonomic status. In order to determine whether the different color phenotypes of Nedyopus patrioticus require separate taxonomic status or are simply synonyms, here, the complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of two different colored N. patrioticus, i.e., red N. patrioticus and white N. patrioticus, are presented. The two mitogenomes were 15,781 bp and 15,798 bp in length, respectively. Each mitogenome contained 13 PCGs, 19 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 1 CR, with a lack of trnI, trnL2, and trnV compared to other Polydesmida species. All genes were located on a single strand in two mitogenomes. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that red N. patrioticus and white N. patrioticus did not show clear evolutionary differences. Furthermore, no significant divergence was discovered by means of base composition analysis. As a result, we suggest that white N. patrioticus might be regarded as a synonym for red N. patrioticus. The current findings confirmed the existence of color polymorphism in N. patrioticus, which provides exciting possibilities for future research. It is necessary to apply a combination of molecular and morphological methods in the taxonomy of millipedes.},

 abstract = {This study presents the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Litostrophus scaber, which is the first mitogenome of the genus Litostrophus. The mitogenome is a circular molecule with a length of 15,081 bp. The proportion of adenine and thymine (A + T) was 69.25\%. The gene ND4L used TGA as the initiation codon, while the other PCGs utilized ATN (A, T, G, C) as the initiation codons. More than half of the PCGs used T as an incomplete termination codon. The transcription direction of the L. scaber mitogenome matched Spirobolus bungii, in contrast to most millipedes. Novel rearrangements were found in the L. scaber mitogenome: trnQ -trnC and trnL1- trnP underwent short-distance translocations and the gene block rrnS-rrnL-ND1 moved to a position between ND4 and ND5, resulting in the formation of a novel gene order. The phylogenetic analysis showed that L. scaber is most closely related to S. bungii, followed by Narceus magnum. These findings enhance our understanding of the rearrangement and evolution of Diplopoda mitogenomes.},

@article{zhang_nfatc1_2023,
 abstract = {Background \& Aims
Loss of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) fosters acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic carcinogenesis by down-regulating transcription programs controlling acinar cell identity. However, how ARID1A reacts to metaplasia-triggering environmental cues remains elusive. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of ARID1A in controlling ductal pancreatic gene signatures and deciphering hierarchical signaling cues determining ARID1A-dependent chromatin regulation during acinar cell reprogramming.
Methods
Acinar cell explants with differential ARID1A status were subjected to genome-wide expression analyses. The impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, NFATc1 activity, and ARID1A status on acinar reprogramming processes were characterized by ex vivo ADM assays and transgenic mouse models. EGFR-dependent ARID1A chromatin binding was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis and cellular fractionation.
Results
EGFR signaling interferes with ARID1A-dependent transcription by inducing genome-wide ARID1A displacement, thereby phenocopying ARID1A loss-of-function mutations and inducing a shift toward ADM permissive ductal transcription programs. Moreover, we show that EGFR signaling is required to push ARID1A-deficient acinar cells toward a metaplastic phenotype. Mechanistically, we identified the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 as the central regulatory hub mediating both EGFR signaling-induced genomic ARID1A displacement and the induction of ADM-promoting gene signatures in the absence of ARID1A. Consequently, pharmacologic inhibition of NFATc1 or its depletion in transgenic mice not only preserves genome-wide ARID1A occupancy, but also attenuates acinar metaplasia led by ARID1A loss.
Conclusions
Our data describe an intimate relationship between environmental signaling and chromatin remodeling in orchestrating cell fate decisions in the pancreas, and illustrate how ARID1A loss influences transcriptional regulation in acinar cell reprogramming.},

 abstract = {Transcription replication collisions (TRCs) constitute a major intrinsic source of genome instability but conclusive evidence for a causal role of TRCs in tumor initiation is missing. We discover that lack of the H4K20-dimethyltransferase KMT5B (also known as SUV4-20H1) in muscle stem cells de-represses S-phase transcription by increasing H4K20me1 levels, which induces TRCs and aberrant R-loops in oncogenic genes. The resulting replication stress and aberrant mitosis activate ATR-RPA32-P53 signaling, promoting cellular senescence, which turns into rapid rhabdomyosarcoma formation when p53 is absent. Inhibition of S-phase transcription ameliorates TRCs and formation of R-loops in Kmt5b-deficient MuSCs, validating the crucial role of H4K20me1-dependent, tightly controlled S-phase transcription for preventing collision errors. Low KMT5B expression is prevalent in human sarcomas and associated with tumor recurrence, suggesting a common function of KMT5B in sarcoma formation. The study uncovers decisive functions of KMT5B for maintaining genome stability by repressing S-phase transcription via control of H4K20me1 levels.},

With an aim to characterize the structural variations in Bradyrhizobium genomes during its evolution, the genomes of AIRs and the reference Bradyrhizobium strains were compared utilizing molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biochemistry techniques. The presence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (nif) genes and photosynthetic genes, as well as components of the T3SS (Type III secretion system) and T3CP (Type III chaperone) in the genome of AIRs, was also assessed. Additionally, the origin, evolutionary history, and genes associated with the NF-independent nodulation pattern in AIRs were explored. The results indicate that horizontal gene transfer events have occurred in AIRs, and three distinct origins of AIRs were estimated: early differentiated AIRs, non-symbiotic Bradyrhizobium, and non-AIRs. In contrast to the significant genetic transformations observed in the second and third groups, the first group of AIRs displays a rich evolutionary history, exhibits high species diversity, and primarily relies on vertical transmission of nitrogen fixation and photosynthetic genes. Overall, the findings provide a fundamental theoretical foundation for gaining a deeper understanding of the phylogeny and genealogy of AIRs.},

 abstract = {Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including RNA processing and DNA methylation/demethylation. How these regulations are controlled remains unclear. Here, through analysis of a suppressor for the OsEIN2 over-expressor, we identified an RNA recognition motif protein SUPPRESSOR OF EIN2 (SOE). SOE is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with several components of the spliceosome. We find SOE associates with hundreds of targets and directly binds to a DNA glycosylase gene DNG701 pre-mRNA for efficient splicing and stabilization, allowing for subsequent DNG701-mediated DNA demethylation of the transgene promoter for proper gene expression. The V81M substitution in the suppressor mutant protein mSOE impaired its protein stability and binding activity to DNG701 pre-mRNA, leading to transgene silencing. SOE mutation enhances grain size and yield. Haplotype analysis in c. 3000 rice accessions reveals that the haplotype 1 (Hap 1) promoter is associated with high 1000-grain weight, and most of the japonica accessions, but not indica ones, have the Hap 1 elite allele. Our study discovers a novel mechanism for the regulation of gene expression and provides an elite allele for the promotion of yield potentials in rice.},

 abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Purpose:}} The pattern of immune cells infiltrating the corneal stroma has been extensively studied in mice, but data on human tissue have been far less elaborate. To further characterize the number and differentiation state of resident immune cells in organ-cultured human corneal tissue, we employed a comprehensive bioinformatic deconvolution (xCell) of bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and flow cytometry (FC). \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} A transcriptome-based analysis of immune cell types in human corneal samples was performed. The results were validated by IHC, focusing on the identification of pro-inflammatory (M1) and regulatory (M2) macrophages. A protocol was established to identify these 2 different macrophage populations in human corneal tissue by means of FC. Subsequently, corneal samples in organ culture were differentially stimulated by IL-10, IL-4 \&amp; IL-13, or LPS and macrophage populations were evaluated regarding their response to these stimuli. Furthermore, cell survival was analyzed in correlation with time in organ culture. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} xCell-based mathematical deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data revealed the presence of CD8 T cells, Th17 cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages as the predominant immune cell types in organ-cultured human corneal tissue. Furthermore, RNA-seq allowed the detection of different macrophage marker genes in corneal samples, including \textit{PTPRC} (CD45), \textit{ITGAM} (CD11b), \textit{CD14}, and \textit{CD74}. Our RNA-seq data showed no evidence of a relevant presence of monocytes in human corneal tissue. The presence of different macrophage subtypes was confirmed by IHC. The disintegration and subsequent FC analysis of human corneal samples showed the presence of both M1 (HLA-DR$^{\textrm{+}}$, CD282$^{\textrm{+}}$, CD86$^{\textrm{+}}$, and CD284$^{\textrm{+}}$) and M2 (CD163$^{\textrm{+}}$ and CD206$^{\textrm{+}}$) macrophage subtypes. Furthermore, we found that the total number of macrophages in corneal samples decreased more than the total cell count with increasing tissue culture time. Treatment with IL-10 led to higher total cell counts per cornea and to an increased expression of the M2 marker CD163 (\textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.05) while expression levels of various M1 macrophage markers were not significantly reduced by interleukin treatment. \textbf{\textit{Conclusions:}} Regarding different macrophage populations, untreated human corneas showed more M1 than M2 macrophages. With increasing organ culture time, these macrophages decreased. In terms of cell dynamics, adding interleukins to the organ culture medium influenced the phenotype of macrophages within the cornea as detected by FC. Modifying the immunomodulatory properties of human grafts appears a promising approach to further reduce the risk of graft rejection in patients. In this context, treatment with interleukins was more effective in upregulating M2 macrophages than in suppressing M1 macrophages in corneal tissue.},

 abstract = {Abiotic stress in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) may trigger distinct transcriptome responses, resulting in significant yield loss. More insight into the molecular underpinnings of the stress response can be gained by combining RNA-Seq meta-analysis with systems biology and machine learning. This can help pinpoint possible targets for engineering abiotic tolerance by revealing functional modules and key genes essential for the stress response. Therefore, to investigate the regulatory mechanism and key genes, a combination of these approaches was utilized in cucumber subjected to various abiotic stresses. Three significant abiotic stress-related modules were identified by gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Three hub genes (RPL18, δ-COP, and EXLA2), ten transcription factors (TFs), one transcription regulator, and 12 protein kinases (PKs) were introduced as key genes. The results suggest that the identified PKs probably govern the coordination of cellular responses to abiotic stress in cucumber. Moreover, the C2H2 TF family may play a significant role in cucumber response to abiotic stress. Several C2H2 TF target stress-related genes were identified through co-expression and promoter analyses. Evaluation of the key identified genes using Random Forest, with an area under the curve of ROC (AUC) of 0.974 and an accuracy rate of 88.5\%, demonstrates their prominent contributions in the cucumber response to abiotic stresses. These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying abiotic stress response in cucumber and pave the way for cucumber genetic engineering toward improving tolerance ability under abiotic stress.},

@article{zirngibl_triose_2023,
 abstract = {Plants have evolved multiple strategies to cope with rapid changes in the environment. During high light (HL) acclimation, the biosynthesis of photoprotective flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, is induced. However, the exact nature of the signal and downstream factors for HL induction of flavonoid biosynthesis (FB) is still under debate. Here, we show that carbon fixation in chloroplasts, subsequent export of photosynthates by triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT), and rapid increase in cellular sugar content permit the transcriptional and metabolic activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis during HL acclimation. In combination with genetic and physiological analysis, targeted and whole-transcriptome gene expression studies suggest that reactive oxygen species and phytohormones play only a minor role in rapid HL induction of the anthocyanin branch of FB. In addition to transcripts of FB, sugar-responsive genes showed delayed repression or induction in tpt-2 during HL treatment, and a significant overlap with transcripts regulated by SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) was observed, including a central transcription factor of FB. Analysis of mutants with increased and repressed SnRK1 activity suggests that sugar-induced inactivation of SnRK1 is required for HL-mediated activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our study emphasizes the central role of chloroplasts as sensors for environmental changes as well as the vital function of sugar signaling in plant acclimation.},
