 abstract = {Ecological disasters, wars in regions with microbiological weapons depots, deforestation, domestication of wild animals, consumption of infected animals, contamination of water and food products and their components, experiments with viruses, deficiencies and other defects of the immune system in modern humans and other mammals became the impetus for the evolution of new dangerous and extremely dangerous viruses. Due to the emergence of new dangerous viruses, the importance and demand for knowledge and skills of computational biology, epidemiology and virology in modern society have increased. Modern sequencers are capable of producing large amounts of bioinformatic data that is represented in the form of genomic texts. Comparative сomputational analysis of this information is necessary to clarify the issues of phylogenesis, mutational profiling, molecular evolution, identification of insertions of other genomes, annotation of genome regions, search for targets for vaccine development and pharmacotherapy. In this сontext, authors conducted a computational experiment of comparative analysis of the genomic texts of Belarusian coronavirus samples against a number of selected complete genomes of dangerous and extremely dangerous viruses and coronaviruses of various origins. Data analysis was performed using the YASS, genomic texts were downloaded from the GISAID, the custom genomic data processing pipeline based on the Galaxy bioinformatics platform was also applied. The article presents the results of an analysis of the available scientific literature and the computational experiment comparing the genomic texts of Belarusian coronavirus samples with a number of selected complete genomes of dangerous and especially dangerous viruses and coronaviruses of various origin. A significant similarity of the new coronavirus with the recombinant coronavirus, as well as partial similarity with synthetic coronavirus, Rubella, Ebola 1976, HIV-2 (human immunodeficiency virus), Middle East respiratory syndrome, simian immunodeficiency and Marburg fever viruses have been found.},

 abstract = {As a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a validated receptor for SARS-CoV-2, linking RAS to COVID-19. Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms likely cause an imbalance in the ACE1/ACE2 ratio, triggering RAS imbalance and may contribute to COVID-19 complications. This study aimed to investigate four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE1 and ACE2 genes, three for ACE1 (rs4343, rs4342, rs4341) and one for ACE2 (rs2285666), in patients with COVID-19 among the Palestinian population. A total of 130 blood samples were collected, including 50 negative controls without COVID-19 infection, 50 cases with COVID-19 infection but not hospitalized, and 30 patients with severe COVID-19 infection hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Fragments of the ACE1 and ACE2 genes, including the targeted SNPs, were amplified using multiplex PCR and subsequently genotyped by next-generation sequencing with specific virtual probes. Our results revealed that ACE2 rs2285666 GG genotype carriers were more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group (P=0.049), while no statistical differences were observed in the distribution of ACE1 (rs4343, rs4342, rs4341) variants between COVID-19 patients and the control group. GA carriers of ACE2, rs2285666, among cases and ICU groups were at lower risk of getting COVID-19 infection (P=0.002 and P=0.013, respectively), and they were unlikely to develop fatigue (P=0.043), headache (P=0.007), loss of smell (P=0.028), and dyspnea (P=0.005). Age and comorbidities such as hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 disease. Symptoms of COVID-19 patients such as fatigue, headaches, runny noses, and loss of smell were significantly higher in non-hospitalized cases of COVID-19, while dyspnea was more frequent in the ICU patients. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the ACE2 rs2285666 GG genotype is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This association suggests a potential genetic predisposition linked to the ACE2 gene, which may influence the susceptibility and severity of the disease.},

@article{acebal_embryogenesis_2023,
 abstract = {The calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa (Dana) has attracted interest because of its use as a copepod model organism as well as its potential economic role as live fish larval feed. While the adult genome and transcriptome of A. tonsa has been investigated, no studies have been performed investigating the genome-wide transcriptional changes during the normal subitaneous embryogenesis. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate said transcriptional changes throughout A. tonsa embryonic development. RNA extraction and de novo transcriptome assembly for the subitaneous embryogenesis of the copepod was conducted. The assembly includes for the first-time samples describing quiescent development and overall helps establishing a framework for future studies on the molecular biology of our species of interest. Among the findings reported, sequences annotated to well-known developmental genes, were identified. At the same time are described the molecular changes and gene expression levels throughout the entire 42 h the embryonic development lasts. In conclusion, here we present the most complete genome-wide transcriptional map of early copepod embryonic development to date, enabling further use of A. tonsa as a model organism for crustacean development.

 abstract = {Legumes house nitrogen-fixing endosymbiotic rhizobia in specialized polyploid cells within root nodules, which undergo tightly regulated metabolic activity. By carrying out expression analysis of transcripts over time in Medicago truncatula nodules, we found that the circadian clock enables coordinated control of metabolic and regulatory processes linked to nitrogen fixation. This involves the circadian clock-associated transcription factor LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), with lhy mutants being affected in nodulation. Rhythmic transcripts in root nodules include a subset of nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs) that have the LHY-bound conserved evening element in their promoters. Until now, studies have suggested that NCRs act to regulate bacteroid differentiation and keep the rhizobial population in check. However, these conclusions came from the study of a few members of this very large gene family that has complex diversified spatio-temporal expression. We suggest that rhythmic expression of NCRs may be important for temporal coordination of bacterial activity with the rhythms of the plant host, in order to ensure optimal symbiosis.},

Nevertheless, there is a relative shortcoming of gene sequence information available in public databases, which hinder their use in more comprehensive investigations that employ sensitivity molecular biology techniques to assess gene expression profile for biomarker identification. In this data article, we report the first de novo transcriptome assembly of A. lacustris testicles, ovaries and male / female pituitary gland improving gene sequence data available for this fish species and transcriptome of male liver. Illumina sequencing generated 808,023,356 raw reads, filtered in 752,739,866 high-quality reads. Initially, a de novo assembly was filtered to include protein coding elements only in each tissue sample, which were merged in a final pantranscriptome (PAN) containing 109,232 contigs. The PAN was functionally annotated against a custom Actinopterygii proteins dataset and EggNOG terms with the aid of EnTAP, retrieving homology queries for about 90\% of all transcripts. Therefore, in this study we provide a PAN and a custom blast tool that can help discovery genomic information on metabolism pathways and their related genes in A. lacustris, enabling future research and molecular studies using this fish species as a model.},

 abstract = {Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) is a marine teleost species with great productive potential worldwide. However, the genomic information currently available for this species in public databases is limited. Such lack of information hinders gene expression assessments that might bring forward novel insights into the physiology, ecology, evolution, and genetics of this potential aquaculture species. In this study, we report the first de novo transcriptome assembly of R. canadum liver, improving the availability of novel gene sequences for this species. Illumina sequencing of liver transcripts generated 1,761,965,794 raw reads, which were filtered into 1,652,319,304 high-quality reads. De novo assembly resulted in 101,789 unigenes and 163,096 isoforms, with an average length of 950.61 and 1,617.34 nt, respectively. Moreover, we found that 126,013 of these transcripts bear potentially coding sequences, and 125,993 of these elements (77.3\%) correspond to functionally annotated genes found in six different databases. We also identified 701 putative ncRNA and 35,414 putative lncRNA. Interestingly, homologues for 410 of these putative lncRNAs have already been observed in previous analyses with Danio rerio, Lates calcarifer, Seriola lalandi dorsalis, Seriola dumerili, or Echeneis naucrates. Finally, we identified 7894 microsatellites related to cobia’s putative lncRNAs. Thus, the information derived from the transcriptome assembly described herein will likely assist future nutrigenomics and breeding programs involving this important fish farming species.},

@article{aerts_altered_2024,
 abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions associated with deficits in social interaction and communication, together with repetitive behaviours. The cell adhesion molecule protocadherin10 (PCDH10) is linked to ASD in humans. Pcdh10 is expressed in the nervous system during embryonic and early postnatal development and is important for neural circuit formation. In mice, strong expression of Pcdh10 in the ganglionic eminences and in the basolateral complex (BLC) of the amygdala was observed at mid and late embryonic stages, respectively. Both inhibitory and excitatory neurons expressed Pcdh10 in the BLC at perinatal stages and vocalization-related genes were enriched in Pcdh10-expressing neurons in adult mice. An epitope-tagged Pcdh10-HAV5 mouse line revealed endogenous interactions of PCDH10 with synaptic proteins in the young postnatal telencephalon. Nuanced socio-affective communication changes in call emission rates, acoustic features and call subtype clustering were primarily observed in heterozygous pups of a conditional knockout (cKO) with selective deletion of Pcdh10 in Gsh2-lineage interneurons. These changes were less prominent in heterozygous ubiquitous Pcdh10 KO pups, suggesting that altered anxiety levels associated with Gsh2-lineage interneuron functioning might drive the behavioural effects. Together, loss of Pcdh10 specifically in interneurons contributes to behavioural alterations in socio-affective communication with relevance to ASD.},

@article{afouda_culturing_2020,
 abstract = {Long considered to be a consequence of human antibiotics use by deduction, antibiotic resistance mechanisms appear to be in fact a much older phenomenon as antibiotic resistance genes have previously been detected from millions of year-old permafrost samples. As these specimens guarantee the viability of archaic bacteria, we herein propose to apply the culturomics approach to recover the bacterial content of a Siberian permafrost sample dated, using the in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclide chlorine36 (36Cl), at 2.7 million years to study the dynamics of bacterial evolution in an evolutionary perspective. As a result, we cultured and sequenced the genomes of 28 ancient bacterial species including one new species. To perform genome comparison between permafrost strains and modern isolates we selected 7 of these species (i.e., Achromobacter insolitus, Bacillus idriensis, Brevundimonas aurantiaca, Janibacter melonis, Kocuria rhizophila, Microbacterium hydrocarbonoxydans and Paracoccus yeei). We observed a high level of variability in genomic content with a percentage of shared genes in the core genomes ranging from 21.23\% to 55.59\%. In addition, the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) comparison between permafrost and modern strains for the same species did not allow a dating of ancient strains based on genomic content. There were no significant differences in antibiotic resistance profiles between modern and ancient isolates of each species. Acquired resistance to antibiotics was phenotypically detected in all gram-negative bacterial species recovered from permafrost, with a significant number of genes coding for antibiotic resistance detected. Taken together, these findings confirm previously obtained data that antibiotic resistance predates humanity as most of antimicrobial agents are natural weapons used in inter-microbial conflicts within the biosphere.},

 abstract = {Premise Alkanna tinctoria (Boraginaceae) is an important medicinal herb with its main distribution across the Mediterranean region. To reveal its genetic variation and population structure, microsatellite markers were developed and validated in four Greek populations. Methods and Results RNA-Seq data of the related species Arnebia euchroma and Echium plantagineum were assembled and mined to identify conserved ortholog sets containing simple sequence repeat motifs. Fifty potential loci were identified and then tested on A. tinctoria, of which 17 loci were polymorphic. The number of alleles ranged from one to nine, and the levels of observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.000 to 1.000 and 0.000 to 0.820, respectively. Most of these loci could be successfully amplified in eight other species of Boraginaceae (Alkanna graeca, A. hellenica, A. sfikasiana, Echium vulgare, E. plantagineum, Lithospermum officinale, Borago officinalis, and Anchusa officinalis). Conclusions This study provides the first set of microsatellite loci for studying the genetic variation and population structure of A. tinctoria and shows their potential usefulness in other Boraginaceae species.},

 abstract = {Colistin is a last-resort antimicrobial used for the treatment of human infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However, colistin is still widely used in intensive poultry production in Bangladesh. We aimed to investigate the dynamics and genetic diversity of colistin-resistant commensal Escherichia coli from broiler chickens. A total of 1200 E. coli strains were characterized from 20 broiler farms at three-time points along the production period. All strains were screened for mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes by a multiplex PCR, and their genetic diversity was measured by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR fingerprinting. Genomic diversity and characterization were performed by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Twenty-five percent of the commensal E. coli strains harbored mcr-1 genes. Frequency of mcr-1 gene detection correlated positively (odds ratio 1.71; 95\% CI 0.96–3.06; p = 0.068) with the use of colistin in poultry flocks. REP-PCR profiles and WGS analysis showed diverse E. coli population carrying multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. Phylogenetic comparison of mcr-1-bearing strains recovered from this study with a global strain collection revealed wide phylogenetic relationship. This study identified a high prevalence of mcr-1 gene among genetically diverse E. coli populations from broiler chickens in Bangladesh suggesting a massive horizontal spread of mcr-1 rather than by clonal expansion.},

Thus far, molecular processes underlying FOXG1 function are largely unexplored. Here, we present a multiomics data set exploring how FOXG1 impacts neuronal maturation at the chromatin level in the mouse hippocampus. At a genome-wide level, FOXG1 i) both represses and activates transcription, ii) binds mainly to enhancer regions, iii) reconfigures the epigenetic landscape through bidirectional alteration of H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and chromatin accessibility, and iv) operates synergistically with NEUROD1. Interestingly, we could not detect a clear hierarchy of FOXG1 and NEUROD1, but instead, provide the evidence that they act in a highly cooperative manner to control neuronal maturation. Genes affected by the chromatin alterations impact synaptogenesis and axonogenesis. Inhibition of histone deacetylases partially rescues transcriptional alterations upon FOXG1 reduction. This integrated multiomics view of changes upon FOXG1 reduction reveals an unprecedented multimodality of FOXG1 functions converging on neuronal maturation. It fuels therapeutic options based on epigenetic drugs to alleviate, at least in part, neuronal dysfunction.},

 abstract = {Molecular Epidemiology: Prevalence of Human Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Palestine in the Period between 2016 and 2024 Using Next Generation Sequencing

Hanan Al-Jawabreh

Abstract
Background: Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. The infection is transmitted by bite of infected female sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus in the old world or Lutzomyia in the new world. The diagnosis is made by stained smear microscopy, in-vitro culture, and DNA-based detection methods.
Materials and Methods: In this study that spanned from 2016 to 2024 included patients from eleven districts in the West Bank of Palestine. The diagnostic methods used in the study included microscopy of Giemsa-stained touch smears, in-vitro culture using NNN medium, and ITS1-PCR. The amplicon-based next-generation sequencing of ITS1-219 was included in the comparison part of the study. The comparison arm of the study compared two groups, CL-confirmed group in w were positive by any of the tests used in the epidemiologic part of the study and a non-CL group which were negative by all diagnostic methods. The NGS1-219-PCR was compared to ITS1-PCR, which is considered as a gold standard owing to its superiority over microscopy and in-vitro culture.
Results: The positivity rate during the study period was 17\% (213/1262) with a prevalence of 7.0 per 100,000. The annual incidence rate 0.84 per 100,000 (25 cases per year) with approximately equal distribution between males (52\%) and females (48\%). The age range between 0 to 14 yrs was the most affected by CL. The CL lesions primarily affected the head (45\%), followed by the upper extremities (38\%) and the lower extremities (17\%).
The choropleth mapping showed that Jericho is still the district with highest annual incidence rate (21 per 100,000). The study revealed that Leishmania tropica is the predominating species with L. major restricted mainly to Jericho. The year 2017 was the last year to witness a CL peak in Palestine with Jericho contributing to 40\% of peak cases. More than half (52\%) of the cases appeared in the months of January to March. As for the comparison arm of the study, ITS1-219-NGS was shown to have a higher sensitivity of 94\% compared to the imperfect gold standard (ITS1-PCR) of 86\%. The agreement between the two tests was fair (Kappa-0.24) only agreed on 56\% of the cases only. Furthermore, the standard ITS1-PCR was unable to genotype 29 CL cases but were genotyped by ITS1-219-NGS and confirmed by BLAST search. Unlike the ITS1-PCR, imperfect gold standard, ITS1-219-NGS genotypes all its positive results correctly as confirmed by BLAST search. Moreover, 13 ITS1-PCR weak positive CL cases were found to be negative by ITS1-219-NGS and upon BLAST search shown to be contamination of human and bacterial origin.
Conclusion: Jericho area remains the main focus of CL in Palestine with L. tropica as the main species in the country and L. major restricted to Jericho area. Incidence rate has dropped compared to the two decades preceding this study as result of control measures implemented. Amplicon-based NGS is a feasible, highly sensitive, and high throughput diagnostic method with accurate species identification that can be used in clinical practice and epidemiologic survey.},

 abstract = {Scientific workflow has become essential in software engineering because it provides a structured approach to designing, executing, and analyzing scientific experiments. Software developers and researchers have developed hundreds of scientific workflow management systems so scientists in various domains can benefit from them by automating repetitive tasks, enhancing collaboration, and ensuring the reproducibility of their results. However, even for expert users, workflow creation is a complex task due to the dramatic growth of tools and data heterogeneity. Thus, scientists attempt to reuse existing workflows shared in workflow repositories. Unfortunately, several challenges prevent scientists from reusing those workflows. Thus, we first attempted to identify those reusability challenges in this study. We also offered an action list and evidence-based guidelines to promote the reusability of scientific workflows. Our intensive manual investigation examined the reusability of existing workflows and exposed several challenges. The challenges preventing reusability include tool upgrading, tool support unavailability, design flaws, incomplete workflows, failure to load a workflow, etc. Such challenges and our action list offered guidelines to future workflow composers to create better workflows with enhanced reusability. In the future, we plan to develop a recommender system using reusable workflows that can assist scientists in creating effective and error-free workflows.},

 abstract = {Water quality testing does not recognise antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and is often limited to indicators of faecal contamination Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species. In Europe, data on AMR in drinking water is scarce. In Ireland, as in many countries, household drinking water is supplied via mains or via private wells or water schemes. Using citizen science, we identified Irish private drinking water supplies as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB). Gram-negative (n = 464) and Gram-positive (n = 72) bacteria were isolated. We identified instances of potentially opportunistic ARB such as Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus species. We report reservoirs of multidrug resistance in Enterococcus casseliflavus, E. cloacae, E. coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Serratia rubidaea. We also identified linezolid-resistant Enterococcus in Irish drinking water. Linezolid is a last-resort antibiotic used to treat vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. Additionally, we identified mobile AMR in three water samples, two of which were carried on IncF group, one on IncQ and five on Col-like plasmids. Our work suggests that private drinking water is a potential sink and source of AMR pathogens. This highlights a value of drinking water surveillance in a One Health framework as the surveillance would provide information regarding the movement and persistence of ARB and ARGs that are able to survive in drinking water and subsequently have the opportunity to be mobilised through humans; linking the environment to the human and potentially threatening human health.},

The association of aberrant DNA methylation with many diseases, as well as the increasing interest in modifying the methylation mark in a directed manner at genomic sites using epigenome editing for research and therapeutic purposes, increases the need for easy and efficient DNA methylation analysis methods. The standard approach to analyze DNA methylation with a single-cytosine resolution is bisulfite conversion of DNA followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In this chapter, we describe a robust, powerful, and cost-efficient protocol for the amplification of target regions from bisulfite-converted DNA, followed by a second PCR step to generate libraries for Illumina NGS. In the two consecutive PCR steps, first, barcodes are added to individual amplicons, and in the second PCR, indices and Illumina adapters are added to the samples. Finally, we describe a detailed bioinformatics approach to extract DNA methylation levels of the target regions from the sequencing data. Combining barcodes with indices enables a high level of multiplexing allowing to sequence multiple pooled samples in the same sequencing run. Therefore, this method is a robust, accurate, quantitative, and cheap approach for the readout of DNA methylation patterns at defined genomic regions.},

This study aimed to develop a comprehensive early life stage toxicity pathway model for the exposure of fish to estrogenic chemicals that is rooted in mechanistic toxicology. Embryo-larval fathead minnows (FHM; Pimephales promelas) were exposed to graded concentrations of 17α-ethinylestradiol (water control, 0.01\% DMSO, 4, 20, and 100 ng/L) for 32 days. Fish were assessed for transcriptomic and proteomic responses at 4 days post-hatch (dph), and for histological and apical end points at 28 dph. Molecular analyses revealed core responses that were indicative of observed apical outcomes, including biological processes resulting in overproduction of vitellogenin and impairment of visual development. Histological observations indicated accumulation of proteinaceous fluid in liver and kidney tissues, energy depletion, and delayed or suppressed gonad development. Additionally, fish in the 100 ng/L treatment group were smaller than controls. Integration of omics data improved the interpretation of perturbations in early life stage FHM, providing evidence of conservation of toxicity pathways across levels of biological organization. Overall, the mechanism-based embryo-larval FHM model showed promise as a replacement for standard adult live animal tests.},

Bioinformatics in plant pathology is vital for analyzing pathogen genomes, achieved through DNA sequencing and annotation. Comparative genomics involves comparing different pathogen genomes to identify commonalities and differences, shedding light on the genetic basis of pathogenicity, virulence, drug resistance, and evolutionary relationships. Bioinformatics also aids in studying pathogen evolution, reconstructing their history, and tracking new variants, essential for predicting disease outbreaks and developing mitigation strategies. Additionally, bioinformatics contributes to advanced diagnostic tools, detecting specific genetic markers for rapid and accurate disease identification, crucial for minimizing crop losses and ensuring food security. This chapter introduces and uses different bioinformatics tools and resources used to study plant pathogens.

However, the comprehensive molecular mechanisms of these effects are yet to be elucidated. The current study investigated the transcriptomic changes induced by seaweed extracts derived from Sargassum vulgare and Acanthophora spicifera on tomato and sweet pepper plants. Tomato and sweet pepper plants were subjected to foliar treatment with alkaline extracts prepared from the above seaweeds. Transcriptome changes in the plants were assessed 72h after treatments using RNA-sequencing. The treated plants were also analysed for defense enzyme activities, nutrient composition and phytohormonal profiles. The results showed the significant enrichment of genes associated with several growth and defense processes including photosynthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, secondary metabolite metabolism, MAPK signaling, and amino acid biosynthesis. Activities of defense enzymes were also significantly increased in SWE-treated plants. Plant nutrient profiling showed significant increases in calcium, potassium, nitrogen, sulphur, boron, copper, iron, manganese, zinc, and phosphorous levels in seaweed-extract treated plants. Furthermore, the levels of auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins were also significantly increased in the treated plants. In addition to these observed effects, were also significant disease reductions of bacterial leaf spot and early blight in SWE-treated plants coupled with an increase in chlorophyll content, plant growth, and fruit yield. The results demonstrated the complex effect of S. vulgare and A. spicifera extracts on the plants’ transcriptome and provide evidence of a strong role of these extracts in increasing plant growth responses while priming the plants against pathogenic attack simultaneously. The current study contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of seaweed extracts in plants and helps their usage as a viable organic input for sustainable crop production.},

Ontology enrichment analysis showed three\&nbsp;gene categories were augmented, including biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the extract had a strong influence on the expression of genes involved in carbon fixation, secondary metabolism, MAPK-signalling, plant hormone signal transduction, glutathione metabolism, phenylpropanoid and stilbenoid metabolism, and plant-pathogen interactions. qRT-PCR validation analysis using 15 genes established a strong correlation with the RNA sequencing results. The activities of defence enzymes were also significantly enhanced by seaweed extract treatment. Furthermore, AN-SWE treated tomato plants had significantly higher chlorophyll and growth hormone content and showed improved plant growth parameters and nutrient profiles than the control. It is postulated that seaweed extract-induced gene regulation was responsible for favourable plant responses that enabled better growth and tolerance to stress conditions.

 abstract = {Background
Enterococcus avium (E. avium) is a Gram-positive nosocomial pathogen that is commonly isolated from the alimentary tract. The objective of this functional genomics study was to identify the resistant genes by analyzing the genome of E. avium IRMC1622a, a type of bacteria found in feces collected from a patient at a Saudi Arabian tertiary hospital.
Methods
The bacterial strain IRMC1622a was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as Enterococcus sp. The resistance phenomics were performed using VITEK® 2, and morphological analysis was achieved using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, the whole bacterial genome of the bacterial strain IRMC1622a was subjected to sequencing during October 2023 using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technology, and mining for resistant genes.
Results
The results of antimicrobial resistant phenomics indicated that the IRMC1622a strain was sensitive to all tested antimicrobial agents except for erythromycin, and the same result was confirmed by genomic analysis in addition to other classes of antibiotics. SEM showed E. avium IRMC1622a is ovoid shape, in single cells (L 1.2797 ± 0.1490µm), in pairs (L 1.7333 ± 0.1054µm), and in chains (L 2.44033 ± 0.1978 µm). The E. avium IRMC1622a genome has 14 (in CARD) antimicrobial resistance genes that were identified with several mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, such as the efflux pump and conferring antibiotic resistance. The present study revealed that the E. avium IRMC1622a genome contains a high number of genes associated with virulence factors, and 14 matched pathogenic protein families and predicted as human pathogen (probability score 0.855). We report two (ISEnfa4 and ISEfa5) mobile genetic elements for the first time in the E. avium genome.
Conclusions
The study concludes that E. avium IRMC1622a is susceptible to all tested antibacterials except erythromycin. The IRMC1622a has 14 genes encoding antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, including the efflux pump and conferring antibiotic resistance. This could indicate a potential rise in E. avium resistance in healthcare facilities. These observations may raise concerns regarding E. avium resistance in healthcare. We need more research to understand the pathophysiology of E. avium, which leads to hospital-acquired infections.},

 abstract = {Bacterial leaf streak disease caused by Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa is an economically important disease threatening wheat and barley crops around the globe. So far, specific PCR-based detection and identification tests for X. translucens pathovars are not available. In this study, we used comparative genomics approach to design a pathovar-specific primer pair for detection of X. translucens pv. undulosa in naturally infected seeds and its differentiation from other pathovars of the species. For this aim, complete genome sequences of strains of different X. translucens pathovars were compared and the specific PCR primer pair XtuF/XtuR was designed. These primers were strictly specific to X. translucens pv. undulosa as the expected 229 bp DNA fragment was not amplified in the closely-related pathovars nor in other xanthomonads, wheat pathogenic bacteria, and other plant pathogenic bacteria. High sensitivity of the primer pair XtuF/XtuR allowed detection of pure DNA of the pathogen in a concentration as low as 4.5 pg/µl. The pathogen was also detected in water suspension at a concentration of 8.6 × 102 cfu/ml. The PCR test was capable of detecting the pathogen in extracts of naturally infected wheat seeds at a concentration of 3.5 × 104 cfu/g while culture plate method was able to detect the pathogen at a concentration of 50 × 105 cfu/g of the same seeds. The PCR test developed in this study is a step forward for precise detection and identification of X. translucens pv. undulosa to prevent outbreaks of the bacterial leaf streak disease.},

 abstract = {Aim: Temperate phages are known to heavily impact the growth of their host, be it in a positive way, e.g., when beneficial genes are provided by the phage, or negatively when lysis occurs after prophage induction. This study provides an in-depth look into the distribution and variety of prophages in Latilactobacillus curvatus (L. curvatus). This species is found in a wide variety of ecological niches and is routinely used as a meat starter culture., 
Methods: Fourty five L. curvatus genomes were screened for prophages. The intact predicted prophages and their chromosomal integration loci were described. Six L. curvatus lysogens were analysed for phage-mediated lysis post induction via UV light and/or mitomycin C. Their lysates were analysed for phage particles via viral DNA sequencing and transmission electron microscopy., 
Results: Two hundred and six prophage sequences of any completeness were detected within L. curvatus genomes. The 50 as intact predicted prophages show high levels of genetic diversity on an intraspecies level with conserved regions mostly in the replication and head/tail gene clusters. Twelve chromosomal loci, mostly tRNA genes, were identified, where intact L. curvatus phages were integrated. The six analysed L. curvatus lysogens showed strain-dependent lysis in various degrees after induction, yet only four of their lysates appeared to contain fully assembled virions with the siphovirus morphotype., 
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that L. curvatus is a (pro)phage-susceptible species, harbouring multiple intact prophages and remnant sequences thereof. This knowledge provides a basis to study phage-host interaction influencing microbial communities in food fermentations.},

 abstract = {Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis are the primary etiological agents of brucellosis in large and small ruminants, respectively. There are limited comparative genomic studies involving Brucella strains that explore the relatedness among both species. In this study, we involved strains (n=44) representing standard, vaccine and Indian field origin for pangenome, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and phylogenetic analysis. Both species shared a common gene pool representing 2884 genes out of a total 3244 genes. SNP-based phylogenetic analysis indicated higher SNP diversity among B. melitensis (3824) strains in comparison to B. abortus (540) strains, and a clear demarcation was identified between standard/vaccine and field strains. The analysis for virulence genes revealed that virB3, virB7, ricA, virB5, ipx5, wbkC, wbkB, and acpXL genes were highly conserved in most of the Brucella strains. Interestingly, virB10 gene was found to have high variability among the B. abortus strains. The cgMLST analysis revealed distinct sequence types for the standard/vaccine and field strains. B. abortus strains from north-eastern India fall within similar sequence type differing from other strains. In conclusion, the analysis revealed a highly shared core genome among two Brucella species. SNP analysis revealed B. melitensis strains exhibit high diversity as compared to B. abortus strains. Strains with absence or high polymorphism of virulence genes can be exploited for the development of novel vaccine candidates effective against both B. abortus and B. melitensis.},

 abstract = {Natural ecosystems can become significant reservoirs and/or pathways for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) dissemination, with the potential to affect nearby microbiological, animal, and ultimately human communities. This is further accentuated in environments that provide direct human exposure, such as drinking water. To date, however, few studies have investigated AMR dissemination potential and the presence of co-selective stressors (e.g., metals/metalloids) in groundwater environments of human health significance. Accordingly, the present study analysed samples from rural (drinking) groundwater supplies (i.e., private wells) in the Republic of Ireland, where land use is dominated by livestock grazing activities. In total, 48 Escherichia coli isolates tested phenotypically for antimicrobial susceptibility in an earlier study were further subject to whole genome sequencing (WGS) and corresponding water samples were further analysed for trace metal/metalloid concentrations. Eight isolates (i.e., 16.7\%) were genotypically resistant to antimicrobials, confirming prior phenotypic results through the identification of ten antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs); namely: aph(3″)-lb (strA; n=7), aph(6)-Id (strA; n = 6), blaTEM (n = 6), sul2 (n = 6), tetA (n = 4), floR (n = 2), dfrA5 (n = 1), tetB (n = 1), and tetY (n = 1). Additional bioinformatic analysis revealed that all ARGs were plasmid-borne, except for two of the six sul2 genes, and that 31.2\% of all tested isolates (n = 15) and 37.5\% of resistant ones (n = 3) carried virulence genes. Study results also found no significant relationships between metal concentrations and ARG abundance. Additionally, just one genetic linkage was identified between ARGs and a metal resistance gene (MRG), namely merA, a mercury-resistant gene found on the same plasmid as blaTEM, dfrA5, strA, strB, and sul2 in the only isolate of inferred porcine (as opposed to bovine) origin. Overall, findings suggest that ARG (and MRG) acquisition may be occurring prior to groundwater ingress, and are likely a legacy issue arising from agricultural practices.},

The MR-6/3H strain was resistant to 19 antimicrobials among 23 tested, including all aminoglycosides, phenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and almost all β-lactams. Phylogenetically, the MR-6/3H was close to clinical origin strains, including those previously isolated in Russia. Comparative genomics revealed the presence of putative antimicrobial resistance genes in the MR-6/3H isolate, mostly associated with efflux systems. Notably, genus-specific OXA-926-like β-lactamase was also detected. In all, 27 putative virulence factors were predicted, the majority of which were associated with motility, adherence, stress survival, siderophore synthesis, and immunomodulation. In the MR-6/3H genome, the five prophage regions were identified, including two with intact levels. Integrons and CRISPR-Cas systems were not detected in the MR-6/3H isolate.

The primary objective of this study was to develop and test a selective and differential plating medium for the isolation of E. albertii from enteric pathogens commonly transmitted via fresh poultry meat, namely E. coli and Salmonella enterica. MacConkey agar supplemented with α-D-+-melibiose and the lactose analogue X-gal was prepared and used to differentially enumerate E. albertii, Salmonella, and E. coli from inoculated ground chicken meat. The medium, MXgMac agar, differentiated the inoculated pathogens with a greater degree of efficiency than did the previously developed E. albertii-selective medium xylose–rhamnose–melibiose (XRM) MacConkey agar, based on differential usage of the lactose analogue and melibiose. Chicken-derived feces and litter samples were subsequently tested using the medium and found not to contain E. albertii by 16S rRNA gene amplification. MXgMac agar facilitates improved differential recovery of E. albertii and other enteric pathogens from poultry meat versus other E. albertii selective/differential media.},

Their functional, microbial-modulating, and probiotic traits enhance not only the sensorial properties but also the nutritional value, beneficial effects, and safety of fermented products. Sporadic cases of opportunistic pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance have deprived safety status from all Weissella species, which thus remain understudied. Our study increased the number of available high-quality and taxonomically accurate W. paramesenteroides genomes by 25\% (9 genomes reported, leading to a total of 36 genomes). We conducted a phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis of the most dominant Weissella species (W. cibaria, W. paramesenteroides, W. viridescens, W. soli, W. koreensis, W. hellenica and W. thailadensis). The phylogenetic tree corroborated species assignment but also revealed phylogenetic diversity within the Weissella species, which is likely related to the adaptation of Weissella in different niches. Using robust alignment criteria, we showed the overall absence of resistance and virulence genes in Weissella spp., except for one W. cibaria isolate carrying blaTEM-181. Enrichment analysis showed the association of Weissella species several CAZymes, which are essential for biotechnological applications. Additionally, the combination of CAZyme metabolites with probiotics can potentially lead to beneficial effects for hosts, such as the inhibition of inflammatory processes and the reduction of cholesterol levels. Bacteriocins and mobile genetic elements MGEs (Inc11 plasmid and ISS1N insertion sequence) were less abundant, however W. thailadensis and W. viridescens showed significant association with specific bacteriocin-encoding genes. Lastly, an analysis of phenotypic traits underlined the need to carefully evaluate W. cibaria strains before use as food additives and suggested the possibility of employing W. paramesenteroides and W. hellenica in the fermentation process of vegetable products. More studies providing high-resolution characterization of Weissella strains from various sources are necessary to elucidate the safety of Weissella spp. and exploit their beneficial characteristics.},

However, the presence of diverse microorganisms in these products can pose challenges to food safety and quality. Here, we provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of a diverse collection of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and staphylococci isolated from raw sheep’s milk. Whole-genome sequencing, phenotypic characterization, and bioinformatics were employed to gain insight into the genetic composition and functional attributes of these bacteria. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of various genetic elements. Important toxin-related genes in staphylococci that contribute to their pathogenic potential were identified and confirmed using phenotypic assays, while adherence-related genes, which are essential for attachment to host tissues, surfaces in the dairy environment, and the creation of biofilms, were also present. Interestingly, the Staphylococcus aureus isolates belonged to sequence type 5, which largely consists of methicillin-susceptible isolates that have been involved in severe nosocomial infections. Although genes encoding methicillin resistance were not identified, multiple resistance genes (RGs) conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, and fluroquinolones were found. In contrast, LAB had few inherently present RGs and no virulence genes, suggesting their likely safe status as food additives in dairy products. LAB were also richer in bacteriocins and carbohydrate-active enzymes, indicating their potential to suppress pathogens and effectively utilize carbohydrate substrates, respectively. Additionally, mobile genetic elements, present in both LAB and staphylococci, may facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of genetic traits, including RGs, virulence genes, and metabolic factors, with implications for food quality and public health. The molecular and phenotypic characterization presented herein contributes to the effort to mitigate risks and infections (e.g., mastitis) and enhance the safety and quality of milk and products thereof.},

The fly species Drosophila biauraria carries a maternally transmitted MK-inducing partiti-like virus, but it was unknown if it carries other MK-inducing endosymbionts. Here, we identified two male-killing Wolbachia strains (wBiau1 and wBiau2) from D. biauraria and compared their genomes to elucidate their evolutionary processes. The two strains were genetically closely related but had exceptionally different genome structures with considerable rearrangements compared with combinations of other Wolbachia strains. Despite substantial changes in the genome structure, the two Wolbachia strains did not experience gene losses that would disrupt the male-killing expression or persistence in the host population. The two Wolbachia-infected matrilines carried distinct mitochondrial haplotypes, suggesting that wBiau1 and wBiau2 have invaded D. biauraria independently and undergone considerable genome changes owing to unknown selective pressures in evolutionary history. This study demonstrated the presence of three male-killers from two distinct origins in one fly species and highlighted the diverse and rapid genome evolution of MK Wolbachia in the host.},

These strains produced the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum β-lactamase, OmpK35 was depleted due to a nonsense mutation, and a novel OmpK36 variant was identified. Yet, starting from 2010, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing ST512 isolates started prevailing and ST37 vanished from sight. Since 2018 the clinical use of the combination of ceftazidime–avibactam (CZA) has been introduced in clinical practice for the treatment of bacteria producing serine-β-lactamases, but KPC-producing, CZA-resistant K. pneumoniae are emerging. In 2021, four CZA-resistant ST37 isolates producing KPC variants were isolated from the same number of patients. blaKPC gene cloning in Escherichia coli was used to define the role of those KPC variants on CZA resistance, and whole genome sequencing was performed on these isolates and on three ST37 historical isolates from 2011. CZA resistance was due to mutations in the blaKPC genes carried on related pKpQIL-type plasmids, and three variants of the KPC enzyme have been identified in the four ST37 strains. The four ST37 isolates were closely related to each other and to the historical isolates, suggesting that ST37 survived without notice in our hospital for 10 years, waiting to re-emerge as a CZA-resistant K. pneumoniae clone. The ancestor of these contemporary isolates derives from ST37 wild-type porin strains, with no other mutations in chromosomal genes involved in conferring antibiotic resistance (parC, gyrA, ramR, mgrB, pmrB).},

One of these strains reached high levels of resistance to both CZA and carbapenems and carried two copies of blaKPC-3 and one copy of blaKPC-31 located on plasmid pKpQIL. The genomes and plasmids of CZA-resistant ST307 strains were analyzed to identify the molecular mechanisms leading to the evolution of resistance and compared with ST307 genomes at local and global levels. A complex pattern of multiple plasmids in rearranged configurations, coresident within the CZA-carbapenem–resistant K. pneumoniae strain, was observed. Characterization of these plasmids revealed recombination and segregation events explaining why K. pneumoniae isolates from the same patient had different antibiotic resistance profiles. This study illustrates the intense genetic plasticity occurring in ST307, one of the most worldwide-diffused K. pneumoniae high-risk clones.},

However, direct comparison of hepatocyte models is currently challenging. We systematically searched the literature and compared different HLCs, but reported functions were limited to a small subset of hepatic functions. To enable a more comprehensive comparison, we developed an algorithm to compare transcriptomic data across studies that tested HLCs derived from hepatocytes, biliary cells, fibroblasts, and pluripotent stem cells, alongside primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). This revealed that no HLC covered the complete hepatic transcriptome, highlighting the importance of HLC selection. HLCs derived from hepatocytes had the highest transcriptional resemblance to PHHs regardless of the protocol, whereas the quality of fibroblasts and PSC derived HLCs varied depending on the protocol used. Finally, we developed and validated a web application (HLCompR) enabling comparison for specific pathways and addition of new HLCs. In conclusion, our comprehensive transcriptomic comparison of HLCs allows selection of HLCs for specific research questions and can guide improvements in culturing conditions.},

Little is known about ISD or the immunological responses of lobsters exhibiting this disease. The objective of this project was to identify genes from H. americanus hepatopancreas that are differentially expressed in response to ISD. Lobsters were separated into asymptomatic, moderately symptomatic, and severely symptomatic groups, which represent animals with 0\%, 5\%–20\%, and {\textgreater}20\% lesion coverage of the carapace, respectively. RNA-seq analysis found that 134 genes were differentially expressed between groups (false discovery rate (FDR) {\textless} 0.05). Most, 80, of these genes were found exclusively in the comparison between moderately symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. All animals clustered in their proposed groups based on the expression of the differently expressed genes (DEGs), and the asymptomatic group clustered as an out-group. The expression of most DEGs was higher in the asymptomatic group than the others, which could be related to a stronger response against the disease or differences in individual resistance against ISD development. Among these genes, we highlight eight chitin-related genes, one α-2-macroglobulin-like gene, one acute phase serum amyloid A gene, one pseudohaemocyanin gene, and one trypsin-1-like gene.},

Thus, the identification of an improved class of inhibitors of PBP3 and PBP5 is imperative, and in this study, phenolics due to their promising antibacterial activities were screened using structure−based pharmacophore and molecular docking approaches against PBP3, and the ability of the lead phenolics to modulate PBP3 and PBP5 was studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The results demonstrated various inhibitory capacities of the lead phenolics, with lysidicichin (−41.66 kcal/mol) and silicristin (−31.11 kcal/mol) being the most potent against PBP3, while epicatechin 3-O-(3-O-methylgallate) (−38.97 kcal/mol) and epigallocatechin-4-benzyl thioether (−37.01 kcal/mol) had higher affinities towards PBP5. Overall, epicatechin gallate had the best broad-spectrum of activity, as the compound was able to bind favourably to both targets. Additionally, the thermodynamic information confirmed the stability of the lead phenolics with both targets. Conclusively, while these observations are suggestive of the modulatory role of the lead phenolics on the growth of E. coli, further in vitro and in vivo validation of the activity elicited by the phenolics in this study is imperative, and efforts are underway in this direction.},

 abstract = {Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae remain the leading cause of pneumonia-related deaths in children {\textless} 5 years globally, and mutations in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 × have been identified as the major cause of resistance in the organism to beta-lactams. Thus, the development of new modulators with enhanced binding of PBP2x is highly encouraged. In this study, phenolics, due to their reported antibacterial activities, were screened against the active site of PBP2x using structure-based pharmacophore and molecular docking techniques, and the ability of the top-hit phenolics to inhibit the active and allosteric sites of PBP2x was refined through 120 ns molecular dynamic simulation. Except for gallocatechin gallate and lysidicichin, respectively, at the active and allosteric sites of PBP2x, the top-hit phenolics had higher negative binding free energy (ΔGbind) than amoxicillin [active site (− 19.23 kcal/mol), allosteric site (− 33.75 kcal/mol)]. Although silicristin had the best broad-spectrum effects at the active (− 38.41 kcal/mol) and allosteric (− 50.54 kcal/mol) sites of PBP2x, the high thermodynamic entropy (4.90 Å) of the resulting complex might suggest the need for its possible structural refinement for enhanced potency. Interestingly, silicristin had a predicted synthetic feasibility score of {\textless} 5 and quantum calculations using the DFT B3LYP/6-31G+ (dp) revealed that silicristin is less stable and more reactive than amoxicillin. These findings point to the possible benefits of the top-hit phenolics, and most especially silicristin, in the direct and synergistic treatment of infections caused by S. pneumoniae. Accordingly, silicristin is currently the subject of further confirmatory in vitro research.},

 abstract = {Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide worldwide as part of arthropods' exoskeletons and fungal cell walls. Low concentrations in soils and sediments indicate rapid decomposition through chitinolytic organisms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The enacting enzymes, so‐called chitinases, and their products, chitooligosaccharides, exhibit promising characteristics with applications ranging from crop protection to cosmetics, medical, textile, and wastewater industries. Exploring novel chitinolytic organisms is crucial to expand the enzymatical toolkit for biotechnological chitin utilization and to deepen our understanding of diverse catalytic mechanisms. In this study, we present two long‐read sequencing‐based genomes of highly similar Jeongeupia species, which have been screened, isolated, and biochemically characterized from chitin‐amended soil samples. Through metabolic characterization, whole‐genome alignments, and phylogenetic analysis, we could demonstrate how the investigated strains differ from the taxonomically closest strain Jeongeupia naejangsanensis BIO‐TAS4‐2T (DSM 24253). In silico analysis and sequence alignment revealed a multitude of highly conserved chitinolytic enzymes in the investigated Jeongeupia genomes. Based on these results, we suggest that the two strains represent a novel species within the genus of Jeongeupia, which may be useful for environmentally friendly N‐acetylglucosamine production from crustacean shell or fungal biomass waste or as a crop protection agent., In this study, a novel chitinolytic Jeongeupia species “wiesaeckerbachi” was isolated from soil samples, characterized biochemically, and sequenced with the long‐read platform PacBio Sequel IIe. In silico analysis unraveled genomic differences to the closest related type strain Jeongeupia naejangsanensis TAS4‐2 in addition to an usually extensive chitinolytic machinery.},

Chloroplast (Cp) genomes play a vital role in comprehending plant evolution, biodiversity, and phylogenetics. Snake fruit is a tropical fruit in the Indo-Malayan region. This work compares seven Salacca species Cp genomes to clarify their genetics and evolutionary connections. Cp genomes were constructed using sequencing data from the BGISeq-500 platform and the GetOrganelle assemblers. The assembled Cp genomes have a standard four-part structure and vary in length from 157,047 to 158,182 kilobase pairs (kbp). Comparative genomics analysis found the ycf1 gene to have the highest number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), revealing missing amino acids in Salacca affinis. The Cp genomes showed a high prevalence of mononucleotide SSR motifs. With a few exceptions, especially Salacca wallichiana, most Cp genomes showed stable borders between the large single copy (LSC), inverted repeat (IR), and short single copy (SSC) sections. This research underscores the importance of Cp genome information for identifying species, a crucial tool for evolutionary studies and breeding purposes. Furthermore, it emphasizes the intimate genetic connection between Salacca and Cocos nucifera, which contrasts with Phoenix dactylifera. This thorough research provides vital insights into the genetics of Salacca species and highlights the usefulness of Cp genome data in subsequent analyses.},

The disease is mainly caused by smoking and becomes among the leading causes of death spread by growing the cancerous cells into the lining of the lungs and nearby lobes. The FDA has given clearance to numerous drugs and chemotherapy agents; nevertheless, they can be exceedingly costly as well as frequently fall short of entirely addressing the ailment. In the medical management of lung cancer, new medicines or active leads with high efficacy and minimal toxicity are required in this era.Methods: The study has been conducted with the intent to uncover a prospective approach to treating lung cancer through structural modification of Hesperetin by creating its analogs to enhance its efficacy compared to its parent compound with the computational drug design. The analysis has been conducted with various approaches followed by PASS prediction, ADME, toxicity profile, molecular docking, data filtration, and anticancer activity.Results: All the compounds showed satisfactory criteria in each parameter that was assessed. The data mining was done carefully by pointing out the compounds that had the greatest value among all the compounds in each investigation, which resulted in a total of 3 compounds out of 50. Conclusions: Finally, the selected compounds were further analyzed for MD simulation studies. Afterward, PCA analysis was also conducted in order to get the lead compound with this additional investigation.Keywords: Lung cancer; Anti-cancer lead; Hesperetin; Drug designing; Molecular docking; MD simulation; PCA},

 abstract = {The proneural transcription factor atonal basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor 7 (ATOH7) is expressed in early progenitors in the developing neuroretina. In vertebrates, this is crucial for the development of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), as mutant animals show an almost complete absence of RGCs, underdeveloped optic nerves, and aberrations in retinal vessel development. Human mutations are rare and result in autosomal recessive optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) or severe vascular changes, diagnosed as autosomal recessive persistent hyperplasia of the primary vitreous (PHPVAR). To better understand the role of ATOH7 in neuroretinal development, we created ATOH7 knockout and eGFP-expressing ATOH7 reporter human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which were differentiated into early-stage retinal organoids. Target loci regulated by ATOH7 were identified by Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease with sequencing (CUT\&RUN-seq) and differential expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of wildtype and mutant organoid-derived reporter cells. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on whole organoids to identify cell type-specific genes. Mutant organoids displayed substantial deficiency in axon sprouting, reduction in RGCs, and an increase in other cell types. We identified 469 differentially expressed target genes, with an overrepresentation of genes belonging to axon development/guidance and Notch signaling. Taken together, we consolidate the function of human ATOH7 in guiding progenitor competence by inducing RGC-specific genes while inhibiting other cell fates. Furthermore, we highlight candidate genes responsible for ATOH7-associated optic nerve and retinovascular anomalies, which sheds light to potential future therapy targets for related disorders.},

 abstract = {The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for bacterial characterisation has increased substantially in the last decade. Its high throughput and decreasing cost have led to significant changes in outbreak investigations and surveillance of a wide variety of microbial pathogens. Despite the innumerable advantages of WGS, several drawbacks concerning data analysis and management, as well as a general lack of standardisation, hinder its integration in routine use. In this work, a bioinformatics workflow for (Illumina) WGS data is presented for bacterial characterisation including genome annotation, species identification, serotype prediction, antimicrobial resistance prediction, virulence-related genes and plasmid replicon detection, core-genome-based or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenetic clustering and sequence typing. Workflow was tested using a collection of 22 in-house sequences of Salmonella enterica isolates belonging to a local outbreak, coupled with a collection of 182 Salmonella genomes publicly available. No errors were reported during the execution period, and all genomes were analysed. The bioinformatics workflow can be tailored to other pathogens of interest and is freely available for academic and non-profit use as an uploadable file to the Galaxy platform.},

@article{baei_pharmacophore_2025,
 abstract = {Due to its global burden, Targeting Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in humans is crucial. Herbal medicine has long been significant, with flavonoids demonstrating promising results. Hence, the present study aimed to establish a way of identifying flavonoids with anti-HBV activities. Flavonoid structures with anti-HBV activities were retrieved. A flavonol-based pharmacophore model was established using LigandScout v4.4. Screening was performed using the PharmIt server. A QSAR equation was developed and validated with independent sets of compounds. The applicability domain (AD) was defined using Euclidean distance calculations for model validation. The best model, consisting of 57 features, was generated. High-throughput screening (HTS) using the flavonol-based model resulted in 509 unique hits. The model’s accuracy was further validated using a set of FDA-approved chemicals, demonstrating a sensitivity of 71\% and a specificity of 100\%. Additionally, the QSAR model with two predictors, x4a and qed, exhibited predictive solid performance with an adjusted-R2 value of 0.85 and 0.90 of Q2. PCA showed essential patterns and relationships within the dataset, with the first two components explaining nearly 98\% of the total variance. Current HBV therapies tend to fail to provide a complete cure, emphasizing the need for new therapies. This study’s importance was to highlight flavonols as potential anti-HBV medicines, presenting a supplementary option for existing therapy. The QSAR model has been validated with two separate chemical sets, guaranteeing its reproducibility and usefulness for other flavonols by utilizing the predictive characteristics of X4A and qed. These results provide new possibilities for discovering future anti-HBV drugs by integrating modeling and experimental research.},

@article{bafna_dynamic_2023,
 abstract = {The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the ventral hypothalamus, synchronizes and maintains daily cellular and physiological rhythms across the body, in accordance with environmental and visceral cues. Consequently, the systematic regulation of spatiotemporal gene transcription in the SCN is vital for daily timekeeping. So far, the regulatory elements assisting circadian gene transcription have only been studied in peripheral tissues, lacking the critical neuronal dimension intrinsic to the role of the SCN as central brain pacemaker. By using histone-ChIP-seq, we identified SCN-enriched gene regulatory elements that associated with temporal gene expression. Based on tissue-specific H3K27ac and H3K4me3 marks, we successfully produced the first-ever SCN gene-regulatory map. We found that a large majority of SCN enhancers not only show robust 24-h rhythmic modulation in H3K27ac occupancy, peaking at distinct times of day, but also possess canonical E-box (CACGTG) motifs potentially influencing downstream cycling gene expression. To establish enhancer–gene relationships in the SCN, we conducted directional RNA-seq at six distinct times across the day and night, and studied the association between dynamically changing histone acetylation and gene transcript levels. About 35\% of the cycling H3K27ac sites were found adjacent to rhythmic gene transcripts, often preceding the rise in mRNA levels. We also noted that enhancers encompass noncoding, actively transcribing enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in the SCN, which in turn oscillate, along with cyclic histone acetylation, and correlate with rhythmic gene transcription. Taken together, these findings shed light on genome-wide pretranscriptional regulation operative in the central clock that confers its precise and robust oscillation necessary to orchestrate daily timekeeping in mammals.},

The current investigation emphasizes on in-silico identification and comparative analysis of different fungal lactases present in Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus oryzae, Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium fujikuroi. Prediction of motifs and domains, chromosomal positioning, gene structure, gene ontology, sub-cellular localization and protein modeling were performed using different bioinformatics tools to have an insight into the structural and functional characteristics of β-galactosidases. Evolutionary and homology relationships were established by phylogenetic and synteny analyses. A total of 14 β-gal genes (GH-35) were identified in these species. Identified lactases, having 5 domains, were predicted to be stable, acidic, non-polar and extracellularly localized with roles in polysaccharide catabolic process. Results showed variable exonic/intronic ratios of the gene structures which were randomly positioned on chromosomes. Moreover, synteny blocks and close evolutionary relationships were observed between Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus oryzae. Structural insights allowed the prediction of best protein models based on the higher ERRAT and Q-MEAN values. And RNA-sequencing analysis, performed on A. fumigatus, elucidated the role of β-gal in germ tube development. This study would pave the way for efficient fungal lactase production as it identified β-gal genes and predicted their various features and also it would provide a road-way to further the understanding of A. fumigatus pathogenicity via the expression insights of β-gal in germ tube development.},

@article{balcke_coordinated_2024,
 abstract = {In plants, exposure to high light irradiation induces various stress responses, which entail complex metabolic rearrangements. To explore these dynamics, we conducted time-course experiments spanning 2 min to 72 h with Arabidopsis thaliana under high and control light. Comparative metabolomics, transcriptomics, redox proteomics, and stable isotope labeling on leaf rosettes identified a series of synchronous and successive responses that provide a deeper insight into well-orchestrated mechanisms contributing to high-light acclimation. We observed transient transcriptome downregulation related to light harvesting and electron flow before the profound remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus. Throughout the entire time course, redox homeostasis is tightly balanced between downregulation of production and enhanced transformation of NADPH accompanied by redistribution of reducing equivalents across several subcellular compartments. In both light conditions, C4 acids such as malate and fumarate are produced via anaplerosis. In carbon units, their accumulation in vacuoles surpasses plastidic levels of starch and intensifies notably under high light. In parallel, citrate synthesis from pyruvate is significantly hindered diurnally. Isotopic labeling in 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate suggests a moderate de novo synthesis of C5 acids from a vacuolar citrate reservoir during the light phase while they are largely renewed during the night. In the absence of a diurnal clockwise flow through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, increased oxidation of photorespiratory glycine takes over as a source of reductants to fuel mitochondrial ATP production. These findings, along with previous research, contribute to a model integrating redox balance and linking increased carbon assimilation and nitrogen metabolism, especially in the context of an incomplete TCA cycle.},

@phdthesis{baldwin_evaluating_2019,
 abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate pesticide used extensively in Canada and around the world. Due to its highly conserved mechanism of action involving inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), CPF has the ability to exert toxicity on non-target species in aquatic systems. In fish species, exposure to CPF has been associated with a range of adverse effects across physiological endpoints including abnormal development, inhibition of AChE, immunomodulation, and molecular level effects such as altered expression of specific genes and global transcriptomes. However, the literature on amphibians exposed to CPF is not as extensive despite the known global declines of amphibian species and the hypothesized links between these declines and anthropogenic pesticide contamination of aquatic systems worldwide. The overall objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the sub-lethal effects of CPF exposure on the model amphibian, Xenopus laevis, across levels of biological organization from molecular to whole animal. 
The first study (Chapter 2) examined the molecular toxicity pathways and mechanisms of toxicity after short-term exposure of early life-stage (ELS) X. laevis to CPF using whole body transcriptome analyses. The ELS transcriptomic responses were then compared to apical outcomes of chronic exposure to CPF to determine if identified dysregulated pathways could provide early indicators of these adverse outcomes. Post-hatch individuals were exposed to nominal CPF concentrations of 0.4, 2, or 10 μg L-1. A subset of individuals were sampled at 96 hours (h) for whole-body transcriptomic analysis and remaining individuals were transferred to tanks for long-term exposure through to metamorphic climax ({\textasciitilde} 75 days). Pathway analysis revealed dysregulated pathways that were related to outcomes known to be associated with exposure to CPF such as altered serine hydrolase activity, impacted metabolic processes, and immune-related outcomes. Other dysregulated pathways with less precedence in the literature included vasculature development and sensory perception of light stimulus. Apical outcomes of chronic CPF exposure included inhibition of AChE activity, increased relative liver weight, and a decrease in percentage of individuals that reached metamorphic climax. Dysregulation of serine hydrolase associated pathways after ELS CPF exposure is in agreeance with the decrease in AChE (a serine hydrolase enzyme) activity observed in the brains of individuals at metamorphic climax. Additionally, an increase in relative liver weight after chronic CPF exposure could be related to dysregulation of ELS pathways associated with metabolic processes and immune function. In fact, several pathways related to immune function were depleted.
In Chapter 3, we more closely examined the potential immunotoxicity of sub-lethal CPF exposure. Post-metamorphic individuals were exposed 1 or 10 μg L-1 CPF (nominal) for 7 days (d), then administered a phosphate buffered sodium (PBS) control injection or a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to stimulate an inflammatory response. At 24 h post-injection, morphometric indices were recorded and tissues were sampled for differential leukocyte counts (flow cytometry), liver pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (qPCR), and kidney histopathology. At 1 µg L−1 CPF, there was a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, an increase in circulating granulocytes, and an increase in the granulocyte:lymphocyte (GL) ratio regardless of immune state. Liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and CSF-1 was increased in individuals exposed to 10 µg L−1 CPF, independent of immune state. Exposure to 10 μg L-1 CPF increased kidney epithelial cell height (by 18 \%) and decreased lumen space in the convoluted tubules of the kidney. This study provided evidence that exposure to CPF can lead to changes in key biomarkers of immune status in amphibians in both immune-rested (PBS-injected) and immune-stimulated (LPS-injected) states. Additionally, we found that LPS was an effective mitogen in our study, capable of inducing a robust and measurable stress response in X. laevis. This response included a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, and increase in circulating monocytes, and an increase in the GL ratio. In addition, increased liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and CSF-1 was induced by LPS injection. We conclude that LPS is an appropriate immunostimulatory agent in an immune challenge assay using X. laevis and that exposure to CPF does not appear to impact the response to LPS exposure. 
Overall, our findings show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of CPF has the ability to impact amphibians at multiple levels of biological organization. A number of affected molecular pathways warrant further study in terms of the underlying mechanisms of CPF-mediated toxicity as well as the associated outcomes of CPF exposure in amphibians. This research provides novel data on the effects of CPF exposure to amphibians, which are generally overlooked and under-represented in the literature despite links between pesticide exposure and globally declining amphibian populations.},

@mastersthesis{barreira_predictability_2024,
 abstract = {Predicting genomic evolution, which is influenced by selection, genetic drift, and population 
history, is a central question in evolutionary biology. This study investigates the genetic basis of 
adaptation in Drosophila subobscura populations that were initially collected from two 
contrasting European latitudes and years, and subsequently underwent independent lab 
adaptation. The goal was to test the predictability of evolution at the genomic level, 
complementing previous research done on phenotypic changes of those populations. 
First approach, I utilised the latest tools and reference genome to recreate existing analysis 
pipelines. I observed some evidence of convergent and parallel evolution, distinct from the 
major signal composed of drift and divergence. No common candidate SNPs were observed 
between populations indicating low repeatability of changes at such level. I also noted major 
genomic changes likely due to selection pressures acting on chromosomal inversion frequencies 
(CIF) across populations. 
After that analysis, I developed custom analysis tools, CAR (coverage adjusted rho) and CDD 
(convergence divergence detection), which analyse more nucleotide data points and differentiate 
between parallel, convergent, and divergent selection. This approach confirmed indication of 
changes in CIF and identified selection peaks across populations, even though the peak regions 
could not be functionally annotated. Most notably, I observed large genomic regions showing 
convergence - likely associated with inversions - while divergence was widespread across the 
genome, likely as a result of genetic drift. I also used these algorithms to successfully detect a 
component of parallel evolution, when comparing populations. 
An ontological functional analysis of candidate regions did not reveal similar motifs across 
populations, suggesting that predictability in evolution might be partially limited to larger 
structures like inversions. Future research with higher coverage data and more comprehensive 
genomic annotation may provide deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of genomic 
evolution, thereby enhancing the predictability of such changes.},

 abstract = {Social insects’ nests harbor intruders known as inquilines,1 which are usually related to their hosts.2,3 However, distant non-social inquilines may also show convergences with their hosts,4,5 although the underlying genomic changes remain unclear. We analyzed the genome of the wingless and blind bee louse fly Braula coeca, an inquiline kleptoparasite of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera.6,7 Using large phylogenomic data, we confirmed recent accounts that the bee louse fly is a drosophilid8,9 and showed that it had likely evolved from a sap-breeder ancestor associated with honeydew and scale insects’ wax. Unlike many parasites, the bee louse fly genome did not show significant erosion or strict reliance on an endosymbiont, likely due to a relatively recent age of inquilinism. However, we observed a horizontal transfer of a transposon and a striking parallel evolution in a set of gene families between the honey bee and the bee louse fly. Convergences included genes potentially involved in metabolism and immunity and the loss of nearly all bitter-tasting gustatory receptors, in agreement with life in a protective nest and a diet of honey, pollen, and beeswax. Vision and odorant receptor genes also exhibited rapid losses. Only genes whose orthologs in the closely related Drosophila melanogaster respond to honey bee pheromone components or floral aroma were retained, whereas the losses included orthologous receptors responsive to the anti-ovarian honey bee queen pheromones. Hence, deep genomic convergences can underlie major phenotypic transitions during the evolution of inquilinism between non-social parasites and their social hosts.},

@article{batista_da_silva_discovery_2023,
 abstract = {Astyanax mexicanus is a well-known model species, that has two morphotypes, cavefish, from subterranean rivers and surface fish, from surface rivers. They are morphologically distinct due to many troglomorphic traits in the cavefish, such as the absence of eyes. Most studies on A. mexicanus are focused on eye development and protein-coding genes involved in the process. However, lncRNAs did not get the same attention and very little is known about them. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap, identifying, describing, classifying, and annotating lncRNAs expressed in the embryo’s eye tissue of cavefish and surface fish. To do so, we constructed a concise workflow to assemble and evaluate transcriptomes, annotate protein-coding genes, ncRNAs families, predict the coding potential, identify putative lncRNAs, map them and predict interactions. This approach resulted in the identification of 33,069 and 19,493 putative lncRNAs respectively mapped in cavefish and surface fish. Thousands of these lncRNAs were annotated and identified as conserved in human and several species of fish. Hundreds of them were validated in silico, through ESTs. We identified lncRNAs associated with genes related to eye development. This is the case of a few lncRNAs associated with sox2, which we suggest being isomorphs of the SOX2-OT, a lncRNA that can regulate the expression of sox2. This work is one of the first studies to focus on the description of lncRNAs in A. mexicanus, highlighting several lncRNA targets and opening an important precedent for future studies focusing on lncRNAs expressed in A. mexicanus.},

The key feature of our system is that it is not a static but a continuously improved collection of tutorials. By coupling tutorials with a web-based analysis framework, biomedical researchers can learn by performing computation themselves through a web browser without the need to install software or search for example datasets.

@article{bawin_cuscuta_2024,
 abstract = {The Cuscuta genus comprises obligate parasitic plants that have an unusually wide host range. Whether Cuscuta uses different infection strategies for different hosts or whether the infection strategy is mechanistically and enzymatically conserved remains unknown. To address this, we investigated molecular events during the interaction between field dodder (Cuscuta campestris) and two host species of the Solanum genus that are known to react differently to parasitic infection. We found that host gene induction, particularly of cell wall fortifying genes, coincided with a differential induction of genes for cell wall degradation in the parasite in the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) but not in a wild relative (Solanum pennellii). This indicates that the parasite can adjust its gene expression in response to its host. This idea was supported by the increased expression of C. campestris genes encoding an endo-β-1,4-mannanase in response to exposure of the parasite to purified mono- and polysaccharides in a host-independent infection system. Our results suggest multiple key roles of the host cell wall in determining the outcome of an infection attempt.},

A whole-genome sequencing was performed, and the bioinformatic analysis of its genome revealed a reduction in the genome size and the number of the genes—a process typical for the adaptation to endosymbiotic conditions. Further analysis of the genome revealed that Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain named A4 could play the role of a probiotic endosymbiont because of the presence of intact genetic sequences determining antioxidant properties, exopolysaccharides synthesis, adhesion properties, and biofilm formation, as well as an antagonistic activity against some pathogens which is not due to pH or bacteriocins production. Additionally, the genomic analysis revealed significant potential for stress tolerance, such as extreme pH, osmotic stress, and high temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a potentially endosymbiotic Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain adapted to and playing beneficial roles for its host.},

MicroRNA-21 is among the strongest upregulated microRNAs in human COVID-19 and in mice with acute inflammatory lung damage, and it is the strongest expressed microRNA in pulmonary macrophages. Chemical linkage of a microRNA-21 inhibitor to trimannose achieves rapid and specific delivery to macrophages upon inhalation in mice. RCS-21 reverses pathological activation of macrophages and prevents pulmonary dysfunction and fibrosis after acute lung damage in mice. In human lung tissue infected with SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo, RCS-21 effectively prevents the exaggerated inflammatory response.

Moreover, the amount of GDF15 in the cell culture supernatant of primary cells correlated positively with tumor volume. The concentrations of the cytokines CCL2, CCL5, and CCL18 and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) 1 in the CSF of the patients were significantly different from those in the CSF controls.

 abstract = {Terrestrial enhanced weathering (EW) of silicate rocks, such as crushed basalt, on farmlands is a promising scalable atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy that urgently requires performance assessment with commercial farming practices. We report findings from a large-scale replicated EW field trial across a typical maize-soybean rotation on an experimental farm in the heart of the United Sates Corn Belt over 4 y (2016 to 2020). We show an average combined loss of major cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) from crushed basalt applied each fall over 4 y (50 t ha−1 y−1) gave a conservative time-integrated cumulative CDR potential of 10.5 ± 3.8 t CO2 ha−1. Maize and soybean yields increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) by 12 to 16\% with EW following improved soil fertility, decreased soil acidification, and upregulation of root nutrient transport genes. Yield enhancements with EW were achieved with significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased key micro- and macronutrient concentrations (including potassium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc), thus improving or maintaining crop nutritional status. We observed no significant increase in the content of trace metals in grains of maize or soybean or soil exchangeable pools relative to controls. Our findings suggest that widespread adoption of EW across farming sectors has the potential to contribute significantly to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goals while simultaneously improving food and soil security.},

@article{belair_botryosphaeriaceae_2023,
 abstract = {The Botryosphaeriaceae family comprises numerous fungal pathogens capable of causing economically meaningful diseases in a wide range of crops. Many of its members can live as endophytes and turn into aggressive pathogens following the onset of environmental stress events. Their ability to cause disease may rely on the production of a broad set of effectors, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes, secondary metabolites, and peptidases. Here, we conducted comparative analyses of 41 genomes representing six Botryosphaeriaceae genera to provide insights into the genetic features linked to pathogenicity and virulence. We show that these Botryosphaeriaceae genomes possess a large diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes; 128 families) and peptidases (45 families). Botryosphaeria, Neofusicoccum, and Lasiodiplodia presented the highest number of genes encoding CAZymes involved in the degradation of the plant cell wall components. The genus Botryosphaeria also exhibited the highest abundance of secreted CAZymes and peptidases. Generally, the secondary metabolites gene cluster profile was consistent in the Botryosphaeriaceae family, except for Diplodia and Neoscytalidium. At the strain level, Neofusicoccum parvum NpBt67 stood out among all the Botryosphaeriaceae genomes, presenting a higher number of secretome constituents. In contrast, the Diplodia strains showed the lowest richness of the pathogenicity- and virulence-related genes, which may correlate with their low virulence reported in previous studies. Overall, these results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity and virulence in remarkable Botryosphaeriaceae species. Our results also support that Botryosphaeriaceae species could be used as an interesting biotechnological tool for lignocellulose fractionation and bioeconomy.},

@article{ben-oz_dual_2023,
 abstract = {p53-mediated cell cycle arrest during DNA damage is dependent on the induction of p21 protein, encoded by the CDKN1A gene. p21 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases required for cell cycle progression to guarantee accurate repair of DNA lesions. Hence, fine-tuning of p21 levels is crucial to preserve genomic stability. Currently, the multilayered regulation of p21 levels during DNA damage is not fully understood. Herein, we identify the human RNA binding motif protein 42 (RBM42) as a regulator of p21 levels during DNA damage. Genome-wide transcriptome and interactome analysis reveals that RBM42 alters the expression of p53-regulated genes during DNA damage. Specifically, we demonstrate that RBM42 facilitates CDKN1A splicing by counteracting the splicing inhibitory effect of RBM4 protein. Unexpectedly, we also show that RBM42, underpins translation of various splicing targets, including CDKN1A. Concordantly, transcriptome-wide mapping of RBM42-RNA interactions using eCLIP further substantiates the dual function of RBM42 in regulating splicing and translation of its target genes, including CDKN1A. Collectively, our data show that RBM42 couples splicing and translation machineries to fine-tune gene expression during DNA damage response.},

@article{benatto_perino_suberin_2025,
 abstract = {Suberin is a hydrophobic biopolymer that acts as an internal and external diffusion and transpiration barrier in plants. It is involved in two phases of wound healing, i.e. initial closing layer formation and subsequent wound periderm development. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of wounded potato leaf tissue revealed preferential induction of cell wall modifying processes during closing layer formation, accompanied by a highly active defense response. To address the importance of suberin in this process, we generated loss of function mutants by CRISPR-Cas9 editing the suberin transporter gene StABCG1. Both wound-induced StABCG1 transcript levels and suberin formation around wounded leaf tissue were reduced in CRISPR-lines. Moreover, wound-induced tissue damage was characterized by browning of wound-adjacent areas. Transcriptome analyses of these areas revealed up-regulation of genes encoding defense proteins and enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Levels of hydroxycinnamic acid amides, acting in defense and in cell wall reinforcement, were drastically enhanced in CRISPR compared to control plants. These results suggest that the reduction in suberin formation around wounded tissue leads to a loss of barrier function, resulting in tissue browning due to enhanced exposure to oxygen.},

@article{bennett-keki_sex-biased_2023,
 abstract = {Differences in lifespan between males and females are found across many taxa and may be determined, at least in part, by differential responses to diet. Here we tested the hypothesis that the higher dietary sensitivity of female lifespan is mediated by higher and more dynamic expression in nutrient-sensing pathways in females. We first reanalysed existing RNA-seq data, focusing on 17 nutrient-sensing genes with reported lifespan effects. This revealed, consistent with the hypothesis, a dominant pattern of female-biased gene expression, and among sex-biased genes there tended to be a loss of female-bias after mating. We then tested directly the expression of these 17 nutrient-sensing genes in wild-type third instar larvae, once-mated 5- and 16-day-old adults. This confirmed sex-biased gene expression and showed that it was generally absent in larvae, but frequent and stable in adults. Overall, the findings suggest a proximate explanation for the sensitivity of female lifespan to dietary manipulations. We suggest that the contrasting selective pressures to which males and females are subject create differing nutritional demands and requirements, resulting in sex differences in lifespan. This underscores the potential importance of the health impacts of sex-specific dietary responses.},

This study aims to investigate the long-term epidemiology of Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM)-producing E. coli in the health district of Bolzano, Northern Italy, by examining the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 26 isolates obtained during 2005–2020. Isolates were identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight, susceptibility testing was by Vitek 2, Sensititre, and Etest; carbapenemase activity was confirmed by Etest and Carbapenemase Inactivation Method (CIM) test; and the VIM-antigen was identified by the NG-Test CARBA 5. Genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations varied across methodologies, and overall category agreement between phenotypic methods was low. All 23 sequenced isolates contained blaVIM-1. Eleven (47.8\%) isolates belonged to the clonal lineage ST131, with fimH30 being the most common subclone. In Bolzano ST131-fimH30 was present as early as 2005. While the ST131 clonal lineage predominated for the first 10 years, various clonal lineages were present, especially in subsequent years, indicating the concurrent circulation of multiple clonal lineages. Future efforts should focus on the implementation of surveillance methods, including genomic analysis, as well as the use of updated infection control strategies and antibiotic stewardship programs to prevent the spread of these carbapenem-resistant strains.},

The clinical difficulties and dangers associated with secondary infections in patients necessitate the exploration of their microbiome. Metaproteomics is a powerful approach to study the taxonomic composition and functional status of the microbiome under study. In this study, the mass spectrometry (MS)-based data of nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients was used to investigate the metaproteome. We have established a robust bioinformatics workflow within the Galaxy platform, which includes (a) generation of a tailored database of the common respiratory tract pathogens, (b) database search using multiple search algorithms, and (c) verification of the detected microbial peptides. The microbial peptides detected in this study, belong to several opportunistic pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhizopus microsporus, and Syncephalastrum racemosum. Microbial proteins with a role in stress response, gene expression, and DNA repair were found to be upregulated in severe patients compared to negative patients. Using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), we confirmed some of the microbial peptides in fresh clinical samples. MS-based clinical metaproteomics can serve as a powerful tool for detection and characterization of potential pathogens, which can significantly impact the diagnosis and treatment of patients.},

Despite significant progress in clinical research, conventional surgical and clinical interventions remain the primary treatment options for meningioma. Several proteomics and transcriptomics studies have identified potential markers and altered biological pathways; however, comprehensive exploration and data integration can help to achieve an in-depth understanding of the altered pathobiology. This study applied integrated meta-analysis strategies to proteomic and transcriptomic datasets comprising 48 tissue samples, identifying around 1832 common genes/proteins to explore the underlying mechanism in high-grade meningioma tumorigenesis. The in silico pathway analysis indicated the roles of extracellular matrix organization (EMO) and integrin binding cascades in regulating the apoptosis, angiogenesis, and proliferation responsible for the pathobiology. Subsequently, the expression of pathway components was validated in an independent cohort of 32 fresh frozen tissue samples using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), confirming their expression in high-grade meningioma. Furthermore, proteome-level changes in EMO and integrin cell surface interactions were investigated in a high-grade meningioma (IOMM-Lee) cell line by inhibiting integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Inhibition of ILK by administrating Cpd22 demonstrated an anti-proliferative effect, inducing apoptosis and downregulating proteins associated with proliferation and metastasis, which provides mechanistic insight into the disease pathophysiology.},

 abstract = {DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) approved for older AML patients are clinically tested in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). The mechanism of action of these drugs is still under debate. In colon cancer cells, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) can downregulate oncogenes and metabolic genes by reversing gene body DNA methylation, thus implicating gene body methylation as a novel drug target. We asked whether DAC-induced gene body demethylation in AML cells is also associated with gene repression, and whether the latter is enhanced by HDACi. Transcriptome analyses revealed that a combined treatment with DAC and the HDACi panobinostat or valproic acid affected significantly more transcripts than the sum of the genes regulated by either treatment alone, demonstrating a quantitative synergistic effect on genome-wide expression in U937 cells. This effect was particularly striking for downregulated genes. Integrative methylome and transcriptome analyses showed that a massive downregulation of genes, including oncogenes (e.g., MYC) and epigenetic modifiers (e.g., KDM2B, SUV39H1) often overexpressed in cancer, was associated predominantly with gene body DNA demethylation and changes in acH3K9/27. These findings have implications for the mechanism of action of combined epigenetic treatments, and for a better understanding of responses in trials where this approach is clinically tested.},

 abstract = {The human silencing hub (HUSH) complex is a transcription-dependent, epigenetic repressor complex that provides a genome-wide immunosurveillance system for the recognition and silencing of newly-integrated retroelements. The core HUSH complex of TASOR, MPP8 and Periphilin, represses these retroelements through SETDB1-mediated H3K9me3 deposition and MORC2-dependent chromatin compaction. HUSH-dependent silencing is RNA-mediated, yet no HUSH component contains a recognised RNA-binding domain. Here we used an unbiased approach to identify which HUSH component was able to bind RNA and determine whether RNA-binding was essential for HUSH function. We identify Periphilin as the major RNA-binding component of the HUSH complex and show that Periphilin's N-terminal domain is essential for both RNA binding and HUSH function. Periphilin binding to RNA was independent of its interaction with TASOR or MPP8, as its N-terminal domain was sufficient for RNA targeting. The artificial tethering of Periphilin to a HUSH-insensitive, nascent transcript, enabled the HUSH-dependent silencing of the transcript. This tethering of Periphilin allowed the RNA-binding region of Periphilin to be removed such that only its C-terminal domain was required for oligomerisation and interaction with TASOR. We therefore show that Periphilin is the predominant RNA-binding protein of the HUSH complex and this RNA-binding is essential for HUSH activity.The Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex provides a genome-wide immunosurveillance system which protects our genome from invading foreign retroelements, such as HIV-like viruses. HUSH is an epigenetic repressor complex that must distinguish these foreign invaders from our own host genes, and immediately silence the invaders. This silencing by HUSH is dependent on RNA transcription, implying at least one of the three core HUSH components binds RNA. Here we identify Periphilin as the major RNA-binding protein of the HUSH complex. We show that RNA-binding by Periphilin is essential for HUSH activity and that artificially recruiting Periphilin to an RNA transcript silences that transcript.},

 abstract = {Introduction
Catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline are key regulators of cardiac function in response to increased demand due to stress, illness, or injury, and are used as therapeutic drugs in intensive care medicine. Continuous overactivation of adrenergic receptors, e.g. in heart failure, clearly aggravates detrimental cardiac remodeling, however, whether transient adrenergic stimulation causes persistent myocardial injury remains debated. In this study, we asked whether the structural alterations of the heart induced by adrenergic stimulation are reversible and investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the remodeling and reverse remodeling process.
Methods and results
Wild-type mice were assigned to 14 days treatment with isoprenaline and phenylephrine (IsoPE), treatment with IsoPE and subsequent recovery, or healthy control groups. IsoPE induced substantial cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy without signs of functional impairment during echocardiography. RNA sequencing from cardiomyocyte nuclei isolated by flow cytometry revealed marked changes in gene expression after IsoPE treatment (295 differentially expressed genes) related to transforming growth factor signaling, vasculature development, or extracellular matrix organization. Analysis of enhancer regions that were linked to differentially expressed genes identified AP-1 family members Jun and Fos as key drivers of these processes and predicted their direct target genes in cardiomyocytes. IsoPE induced marked changes in the gene expression of adrenergic receptors and their downstream signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes that may be related to receptor desensitization. Within two weeks after IsoPE withdrawal, structural remodeling of the heart recovered and {\textasciitilde}95 \% of genes that were differentially expressed with IsoPE treatment returned to baseline expression.
Conclusion
We demonstrate here that prolonged catecholamine treatment at doses that induce left ventricular hypercontractility, but no overt heart failure, resulted in significant yet reversible cardiac injury. Immediate early transcription factors such as Jun and Fos were identified as main drivers of IsoPE induced pathological gene expression in cardiomyocytes.},

OPNA exposure can lead to several neurological, sensory, and motor symptoms that can manifest into chronic neurological illnesses later in life. There is still a large need for technological advancement to better understand changes in brain function following OPNA exposure. The human-relevant {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} multi-electrode array (MEA) system, which combines the MEA technology with human stem cell technology, has the potential to monitor the acute, sub-chronic, and chronic consequences of OPNA exposure on brain activity. However, the application of this system to assess OPNA hazards and risks to human brain function remains to be investigated. In a concentration-response study, we have employed a human-relevant MEA system to monitor and detect changes in the electrical activity of engineered neural networks to increasing concentrations of the sarin surrogate 4-nitrophenyl isopropyl methylphosphonate (NIMP). We report a biphasic response in the spiking (but not bursting) activity of neurons exposed to low (i.e., 0.4 and 4 μM) versus high concentrations (i.e., 40 and 100 μM) of NIMP, which was monitored during the exposure period and up to 6 days post-exposure. Regardless of the NIMP concentration, at a network level, communication or coordination of neuronal activity decreased as early as 60 min and persisted at 24 h of NIMP exposure. Once NIMP was removed, coordinated activity was no different than control (0 μM of NIMP). Interestingly, only in the high concentration of NIMP did coordination of activity at a network level begin to decrease again at 2 days post-exposure and persisted on day 6 post-exposure. Notably, cell viability was not affected during or after NIMP exposure. Also, while the catalytic activity of AChE decreased during NIMP exposure, its activity recovered once NIMP was removed. Gene expression analysis suggests that human iPSC-derived neurons and primary human astrocytes resulted in altered genes related to the cell’s interaction with the extracellular environment, its intracellular calcium signaling pathways, and inflammation, which could have contributed to how neurons communicated at a network level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Recombinantly produced proteins are indispensable tools for medical applications. Since the majority of them are glycoproteins, their N-glycosylation profiles are major determinants for their activity, structural properties and safety. For therapeutical applications, a glycosylation pattern adapted to product and treatment requirements is advantageous. Physcomitrium patens (Physcomitrella, moss) is able to perform highly homogeneous complex-type N-glycosylation. Additionally, it has been glyco-engineered to eliminate plant-specific sugar residues by knock-out of the β1,2-xylosyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase genes (Δxt/ft). Furthermore, Physcomitrella meets wide-ranging biopharmaceutical requirements such as GMP compliance, product safety, scalability and outstanding possibilities for precise genome engineering. However, all plants, in contrast to mammals, lack the capability to perform N-glycan sialylation. Since sialic acids are a common terminal modification on human N glycans, the property to perform N-glycan sialylation is highly desired within the plant-based biopharmaceutical sector. In this study, we present the successful achievement of protein N-glycan sialylation in stably transformed Physcomitrella. The sialylation ability was achieved in a Δxt/ft moss line by stable expression of seven mammalian coding sequences combined with targeted organelle-specific localization of the encoded enzymes responsible for the generation of β1,4 galactosylated acceptor N glycans as well as the synthesis, activation, transport and transfer of sialic acid. Production of free (Neu5Ac) and activated (CMP-Neu5Ac) sialic acid was proven. The glycosidic anchor for the attachment of terminal sialic acid was generated by the introduction of a chimeric human β1,4 galactosyltransferase gene under the simultaneous knock-out of the gene encoding the endogenous β1,3 galactosyltransferase. Functional complex-type N-glycan sialylation was confirmed via mass spectrometric analysis of a stably co-expressed recombinant human protein.},

 abstract = {Alternative mRNA splicing is common in cancers. In BRAF V600E-mutated malignant melanoma, a frequent mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors involves alternative splicing (AS) of BRAF. The resulting shortened BRAF protein constitutively dimerizes and conveys drug resistance. Here, we have analysed AS in SK-MEL-239 melanoma cells and a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib)-resistant derivative that expresses an AS, shortened BRAF V600E transcript. Transcriptome analysis showed differential expression of spliceosome components between the two cell lines. As there is no consensus approach to analysing AS events, we used and compared four common AS softwares based on different principles, DEXSeq, rMATS, ASpli, and LeafCutter. Two of them correctly identified the BRAF V600E AS in the vemurafenib-resistant cells. Only 12 AS events were identified by all four softwares. Testing the AS predictions experimentally showed that these overlapping predictions are highly accurate. Interestingly, they identified AS caused alterations in the expression of melanin synthesis and cell migration genes in the vemurafenib-resistant cells. This analysis shows that combining different AS analysis approaches produces reliable results and meaningful, biologically testable hypotheses.},

To compare MACE to standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, four healthy conjunctiva from four subjects were collected during vitreoretinal surgery, halved and immediately transferred to RNA lysis buffer without prior fixation and then processed for either standard RNA-Seq or MACE RNA-Seq analysis. To assess the impact of FFPE preparation on MACE, a third part was fixed in formalin and processed for paraffin embedding, and its transcriptional profile was compared with the unfixed specimens analyzed by MACE. To investigate the impact of FFPE storage time on MACE results, 24 FFPE-treated conjunctival samples from 24 patients were analyzed as well. Nineteen thousand six hundred fifty-nine transcribed genes were detected by both MACE and standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, while 3251 and 2213 transcripts were identified explicitly by MACE or RNA-Seq, respectively. Standard RNA-Seq tended to yield longer detected transcripts more often than MACE technology despite normalization, indicating that the MACE technology is less susceptible to a length bias. FFPE processing revealed negligible effects on MACE sequencing results. Several quality-control measurements showed that long-term storage in paraffin did not decrease the diversity of MACE libraries. We noted a nonlinear relation between storage time and the number of raw reads with an accelerated decrease within the first 1000 days in paraffin, while the numbers remained relatively stable in older samples. Interestingly, the number of transcribed genes detected was independent on FFPE storage time. RNA of sufficient quality and quantity can be extracted from FFPE samples to obtain comprehensive transcriptome profiling using MACE technology. We thus present MACE as a novel opportunity for utilizing FFPE samples stored in histological archives.},

In this study we compare its expression profile to conjunctival papilloma (Pap) and healthy conjunctival tissue (Ctrl) and develop a classification tool to differentiate these entities. Seven conjunctival SCC, seven Pap and ten Ctrl were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and analyzed using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and gene ontology (GO) clusters were explored and the abundance of involved cell types was quantified by xCell. Finally, a classification model was developed to distinguish SCC from Pap and Ctrl. Among the most prominent DEG in SCC a plethora of keratins were upregulated when compared to Pap and Ctrl. xCell analysis revealed an enrichment of immune cells, including activated dendritic cells and T-helper type 1 cells (Th1), in SCC when compared to Ctrl. The generated classification model could reliably discriminate between the three entities according to the expression pattern of 30 factors. This study provides a transcriptome-wide gene expression profile of rare conjunctival SCC. The analysis identifies distinct keratins, as well as dendritic and Th1 cells as important mediators in SCC. Finally, the provided gene expression classifier may become an aid to the conventional histological classification of conjunctival tumors in uncertain cases.},

This study involves a total of 13 patients of advanced age with disorders of the vitreoretinal interface undergoing vitrectomy at the University Eye Hospital Freiburg between 2018 and 2019. Vitreal hyalocytes were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and isolated as CD45+CD11b+CX3CR1+Mat-Mac+ cells using a FACS-based sorting protocol. RNA extraction, library preparation and RNA sequencing were performed and the sequencing data was analyzed using the Galaxy web platform. The transcriptome of human hyalocytes was compared to the transcriptional profile of human blood-derived monocytes, macrophages and brain microglia obtained from public databases. Protein validation for selected factors was performed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections from three human donor eyes. On average, 383 ± 233 hyalocytes were isolated per patient, resulting in 128 pg/µl ± 76 pg/µl total RNA per sample. RNA sequencing revealed that SPP1, FTL, CD74 and HLA-DRA are among the most abundantly expressed genes in hyalocytes, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence for CD74, FTL and HLA-DRA. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that biological processes such as “humoral immune response”, “leukocyte migration” and “antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen” (adjusted p \&lt; 0.001) are dominating in vitreal hyalocytes. While the comparison of the gene expression profiles of hyalocytes and other myeloid cell populations showed an overall strong similarity (R2 \&gt; 0.637, p \&lt; 0.001), hyalocytes demonstrated significant differences with respect to common leukocyte-associated factors. In particular, transcripts involved in the immune privilege of the eye, such as POMC, CD46 and CD86, were significantly increased in hyalocytes compared to other myeloid cell subsets. Human hyalocytes represent a unique and distinct innate immune cell population specialized and adapted for the tissue-specific needs in the human vitreous. Vitreal hyalocytes are characterized by a strong expression of genes related to antigen processing and presentation as well as immune modulation. Thus, hyalocytes may represent an underestimated mediator in vitreoretinal disease and for the immune privilege of the eye.},

Additionally, we sampled salmon lice in the nauplius II stage, determined the sex of each individual, pooled their RNA according to their sex, and used RNA sequencing to search for differences in gene expression and further sex-specific SNPs. We succeeded in developing a sex-determination assay that works on DNA or RNA from even the earliest larval stages of the salmon louse after hatching. At these early developmental stages, male salmon lice develop slightly quicker than females. We detected several previously unknown, sex-specific SNPs in our RNA-data seq, but only very few genes showed a differential expression between the sexes.

Based on well-established workflows, we evaluated the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, lab-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observed that variability at the peptide level was predominantly due to wet-lab workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines.

 abstract = {The marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is currently used for various industrial applications, including the pharmaceutical industry as a cost-effective cell biofactory to produce Biologics. Recent studies demonstrated that P. tricornutum can produce functional monoclonal antibodies, such application is currently limited by the production yield that hinders industrialization. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and control the cell biology of P. tricornutum to improve the Biologics production yield. Transcriptomic analyses have recently been used by the pharmaceutical industry to improve the production of Biologics in mammalian cells, especially Biologics titer and cell productivity. Hence, in the present work, we performed a meta-analysis of seven publicly available RNA-Seq datasets from different strains of P. tricornutum, for which the culture conditions were chosen as similar as possible. We analyzed the differential expression of genes that are involved in biological processes that are well known to potentially impact the bioproduction and critical quality attributes of Biologics. Therefore, the expression of genes involved in the N-glycan biosynthesis, protein export and secretion, protein quality control and proteasome, as well as those encoding proteases were analyzed and compared. The results pave the way towards optimizing Biologics production in P. tricornutum and highlight that the Pt4, Pt3 Ov and Pt8 strains seem to be the most promising P. tricornutum strains.},

 abstract = {The disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) mediates methylation of histone H3 at position lysine 79 (H3K79). Conditional knockout of Dot1l in mouse cerebellar granule cells (Dot1l-cKOAtoh1) led to a smaller external granular layer with fewer precursors of granule neurons. Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 mice had impaired proliferation and differentiation of granular progenitors, which resulted in a smaller cerebellum. Mutant mice showed mild ataxia in motor behavior tests. In contrast, Purkinje cell-specific conditional knockout mice showed no obvious phenotype. Genome-wide transcription analysis of Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 cerebella using microarrays revealed changes in genes that function in cell cycle, cell migration, axon guidance, and metabolism. To identify direct DOT1L target genes, we used genome-wide profiling of H3K79me2 and transcriptional analysis. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DR) and differentially expressed genes (DE) revealed in total 12 putative DOT1L target genes in Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 affecting signaling (Tnfaip8l3, B3galt5), transcription (Otx1), cell migration and axon guidance (Sema4a, Sema5a, Robo1), cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Lss, Cyp51), cell cycle (Cdkn1a), calcium-dependent cell-adhesion or exocytosis (Pcdh17, Cadps2), and unknown function (Fam174b). Dysregulated expression of these target genes might be implicated in the ataxia phenotype observed in Dot1l-cKOAtoh1.},

 abstract = {The type VIIb protein secretion system (T7SSb) is found in Bacillota (firmicute) bacteria and has been shown to mediate interbacterial competition. EssC is a membrane-bound ATPase that is a critical component of the T7SSb and plays a key role in substrate recognition. Prior analysis of available genome sequences of the foodborne bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has shown that although the T7SSb was encoded as part of the core genome, EssC could be found as one of seven different sequence variants. While each sequence variant was associated with a specific suite of candidate substrate proteins encoded immediately downstream of essC, many LXG-domain proteins were encoded across multiple essC sequence variants. Here, we have extended this analysis using a diverse collection of 37 930 L . monocytogenes genomes. We have identified a rare eighth variant of EssC present in ten L. monocytogenes lineage III genomes. These genomes also encode a large toxin of the rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) repeat family adjacent to essC8, along with a probable immunity protein and three small accessory proteins. We have further identified nine novel LXG-domain proteins, and four additional chromosomal hotspots across L. monocytogenes genomes where LXG proteins can be encoded. The eight L. monocytogenes EssC variants were also found in other Listeria species, with additional novel EssC types also identified. Across the genus, species frequently encoded multiple EssC types, indicating that T7SSb diversity is a primary feature of the genus Listeria .},

We use up-to-date models of the gravitational wave power spectra to compare constraints on the parameters of the phase transition for the three different available PTA measurements and to work out a refined estimate of the cosmological magnetic field that should result from this transition. We find that the PTA data, combined with a constraint from the abundance of primordial black holes, are consistent with a possibility of a moderate strength first-order phase transition during quark confinement and yield a rather precise prediction for the initial parameters of the magnetic field, with the magnetic field energy density in near equipartition with photon energy density and correlation length close to one co-moving parsec.},

 abstract = {Cyanobacteria are highly promising microorganisms in forthcoming biotechnologies. Besides the systematic development of molecular tools for genetic engineering, the design of chassis strains and novel reactor concepts are in focus. The latter includes capillary biofilm reactors (CBR), which offer a high surface area-to-volume ratio and very high cell densities. In this context, Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7712 was found to be highly suited for this reactor system due to maximal surface coverage, extraordinarily strong biofilm attachment, and high biomass formation. Here, we provide the genome sequence of Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7712 to potentially allow targeted strain engineering. Surprisingly, it was almost identical to an available incomplete genome draft of Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7601. Thus, we completely sequenced this strain as well and compared it in detail to strain PCC 7712. Comparative genome analysis revealed 257 and 80 unique protein-coding sequences for strains PCC 7601 and PCC 7712, respectively. Clustering genomes based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 16S rRNA homology showed 99.98\% similarity and only minor distance, respectively, between the two strains in contrast to 21 other cyanobacterial genomes. Despite these high similarities, both strains differ in the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and show specific sequence variations, which are discussed in the paper.},

 abstract = {Objectives
This study reports the genomic characterization of the multidrug resistant Salmonella Newport strain 195\_20 recovered from the diarrheic faeces of a foal in Brazil and co-harbouring the mcr-9, blaCMY-2 and qnrB19 antibiotic resistance genes.
Methods
Bacterial isolate positive for mobile colistin resistance gene (mcr-9) was submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion and broth microdilution for colistin and polymyxin B. The isolate was submitted to whole genome sequencing by Illumina technology and Nanopore Sequencing. Conjugation assays, plasmid sizes determined by S1-PFGE and plasmid content were investigated by hybrid assembly after MinIon long reads sequencing.
Results
Isolate 195\_20 was identified as sequence type ST45, resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins (ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime), aminoglycosides (streptomycin and gentamicin), phenicol (chloramphenicol), quinolones and fluoroquinolones (nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and pefloxacin), folate pathway antagonists (sulfonamides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and tetracycline. A transferable IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid sized ca. 262kb was found to carry the mcr-9 gene in a module consisting of IS903-mcr-9-wbuC-IS26. In addition, an 174kb IncC and a 48kb IncN plasmid were also identified in the 195\_20 isolate, carrying blaCMY-2 and qnrB19, respectively.
Conclusions
Not surprisingly, isolate 195\_20 was susceptible to polymyxins, possibly due to absence of qseBC regulatory operon. Presence of mobile colistin resistance (mcr-9), third-generation cephalosporins (blaCMY-2) and quinolone (qnrB19) resistance determinants in zoonotic pathogens from animals in close contact with humans alerts for the possible route of transmission between these different reservoirs.},

 abstract = {Harmful algal blooms plague bodies of freshwater globally. These blooms are often composed of outgrowths of cyanobacteria capable of producing the heptapeptide Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) which is a well-known hepatotoxin. Recently, MC-LR has been detected in aerosols generated from lake water. However, the risk for human health effects due to MC-LR inhalation exposure have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we exposed a fully differentiated 3D human airway epithelium derived from 14 healthy donors to MC-LR-containing aerosol once a day for 3 days. Concentrations of MC-LR ranged from 100 pM to 1 µM. Although there were little to no detrimental alterations in measures of the airway epithelial function (i.e. cell survival, tissue integrity, mucociliary clearance, or cilia beating frequency), a distinct shift in the transcriptional activity was found. Genes related to inflammation were found to be upregulated such as C-C motif chemokine 5 (CCL5; log2FC = 0.57, p = 0.03) and C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7; log2FC = 0.84, p = 0.03). Functionally, conditioned media from MC-LR exposed airway epithelium was also found to have significant chemo-attractive properties for primary human neutrophils. Additionally, increases were found in the concentration of secreted chemokine proteins in the conditioned media such as CCL1 (log2FC = 5.07, p = 0.0001) and CCL5 (log2FC = 1.02, p = 0.046). These results suggest that MC-LR exposure to the human airway epithelium is capable of inducing an inflammatory response that may potentiate acute or chronic disease.},

 abstract = {Cardiomyopathy is one of the major causes of heart failure that affects approximately 26 million patients worldwide. In a healthy situation, the heart depends on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to maintain its energy demand. In failing hearts, the heart reverts to a fetal-like metabolic state in which FAO is downregulated and the heart switches to glucose metabolism. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), a regulator of FAO, has recently been found to be hypoacetylated and its downstream effectors downregulated in dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the exact mechanisms remain largely unknown. The main purpose of this internship was to identify the specific FAO expression patterns in a large heterogenic patient cohort and investigate the involvement of PPARA regulation. The secondary goal was to set up a transcriptomic pipeline within Galaxy, a user-friendly bioinformatics platform, and test whether this platform can be used in diagnostics in the future. Differential expression analysis and gene enrichment of RNA-sequencing data show a type-specific FAO expression pattern of DCM and LVH versus HCM and confirm a downregulation of FAO related processes. Public RNA-sequencing data after the use of a bezafibrate, a PPARA agonist, which has been integrated, shows the upregulation of genes that are downregulated in our data. Combined, the results confirm the downregulation of FAO, but indicate a disease-type-specific FAO expression pattern. The results from the Galaxy pipeline show that this pipeline is suitable for transcriptomic analyses. Furthermore, we highlight the potential therapeutic role of bezafibrate in cardiomyopathy.},

 abstract = {Chromatin properties are regulated by complex networks of epigenome modifications. Currently, it is unclear how these modifications interact and if they control downstream effects such as gene expression. We employed promiscuous chromatin binding of a zinc finger fused catalytic domain of DNMT3A to introduce DNA methylation in HEK293 cells at many CpG islands (CGIs) and systematically investigated the dynamics of the introduced DNA methylation and the consequent changes of the epigenome network. We observed efficient methylation at thousands of CGIs, but it was unstable at about 90\% of them, highlighting the power of genome-wide molecular processes that protect CGIs against DNA methylation. Partially stable methylation was observed at about 1000 CGIs, which showed enrichment in H3K27me3. Globally, the introduced DNA methylation strongly correlated with a decrease in gene expression indicating a direct effect. Similarly, global but transient reductions in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac were observed after DNA methylation but no changes were found for H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. Our data provide a global and time-resolved view on the network of epigenome modifications, their connections with DNA methylation and the responses triggered by artificial DNA methylation revealing a direct repressive effect of DNA methylation in CGIs on H3K4me3, histone acetylation, and gene expression.},

@article{broche_genome-wide_2023,
 abstract = {While cytosine-C5 methylation of DNA is an essential regulatory system in higher eukaryotes, the presence and relevance of 6-methyladenine (m6dA) in human cells is controversial. To study the role of m6dA in human DNA, we introduced it in human cells at a genome-wide scale at GANTC and GATC sites by expression of bacterial DNA methyltransferases and observed concomitant reductions in cell viability, in particular after global GANTC methylation. We identified several genes that are directly regulated by m6dA in a GANTC context. Upregulated genes showed m6dA-dependent reduction of H3K27me3 suggesting that the PRC2 complex is inhibited by m6dA. Genes downregulated by m6dA showed enrichment of JUN family transcription factor binding sites. JUN binds m6dA containing DNA with reduced affinity suggesting that m6dA can reduce the recruitment of JUN transcription factors to target genes. Our study documents that global introduction of m6dA in human DNA has physiological effects. Furthermore, we identified a set of target genes which are directly regulated by m6dA in human cells, and we defined two molecular pathways with opposing effects by which artificially introduced m6dA in GANTC motifs can directly control gene expression and phenotypes of human cells.},

 abstract = {Vibrio natriegens is the fastest-growing bacterium, with a doubling time of approximately 12–14 min. It has a high potential for basic research and biotechnological applications, e.g., it can be used for the cell-free production of (labeled) heterologous proteins, for synthetic biological applications, and for the production of various compounds. However, the ploidy level in V. natriegens remains unknown. At nine time points throughout the growth curve, we analyzed the numbers of origins and termini of both chromosomes with qPCR and the relative abundances of all genomic sites with marker frequency analyses. During the lag phase until early exponential growth, the origin copy number and origin/terminus ratio of chromosome 1 increased severalfold, but the increase was lower for chromosome 2. This increase was paralleled by an increase in cell volume. During the exponential phase, the origin/terminus ratio and cell volume decreased again. This highly dynamic and fast regulation has not yet been described for any other species. In this study, the gene dosage increase in origin-adjacent genes during the lag phase is discussed together with the nonrandom distribution of genes on the chromosomes of V. natriegens. Taken together, the results of this study provide the first comprehensive overview of the chromosome dynamics in V. natriegens and will guide the optimization of molecular biological characterization and biotechnological applications.},

 abstract = {Genome annotation is central to today's proteomic research as it draws the outlines of the proteomic landscape. Traditional models of open reading frame (ORF) annotation impose two arbitrary criteria: a minimum length of 100 codons and a single ORF per transcript. However, a growing number of studies report expression of proteins from allegedly non-coding regions, challenging the accuracy of current genome annotations. These novel proteins were found encoded either within non-coding RNAs, 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, or overlapping a known coding sequence (CDS) in an alternative ORF. OpenProt is the first database that enforces a polycistronic model for eukaryotic genomes, allowing annotation of multiple ORFs per transcript. OpenProt is freely accessible and offers custom downloads of protein sequences across 10 species. Using OpenProt database for proteomic experiments enables novel proteins discovery and highlights the polycistronic nature of eukaryotic genes. The size of OpenProt database (all predicted proteins) is substantial and need be taken in account for the analysis. However, with appropriate false discovery rate (FDR) settings or the use of a restricted OpenProt database, users will gain a more realistic view of the proteomic landscape. Overall, OpenProt is a freely available tool that will foster proteomic discoveries.},

 abstract = {DNA replication produces a global disorganization of chromatin structure that takes hours to be restored. However, how these chromatin rearrangements affect the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of cell identity is not clear. Here, we use ChOR-seq and ChrRNA-seq experiments to analyze RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity and nascent RNA synthesis during the first hours after chromatin replication in human cells. We observe that transcription elongation is rapidly reactivated in nascent chromatin but that RNAPII abundance and distribution are altered, producing heterogeneous changes in RNA synthesis. Moreover, this first wave of transcription results in RNAPII blockages behind the replication fork, leading to changes in alternative splicing. Altogether, our results deepen our understanding of how transcriptional programs are regulated during cell division and uncover molecular mechanisms that explain why chromatin replication is an important source of gene expression variability.},

PIM kinases are downstream of several cytokine signaling pathways that drive immune-mediated diseases. Uncontrolled T helper 17 (Th17) cell activation has been associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. However, the detailed molecular function of PIMs in human Th17 cell regulation has yet to be studied. In the present study, we comprehensively investigated how the three PIMs simultaneously alter transcriptional gene regulation during early human Th17 cell differentiation. By combining PIM triple knockdown with bulk and scRNA-seq approaches, we found that PIM deficiency promotes the early expression of key Th17-related genes while suppressing Th1-lineage genes. Further, PIMs modulate Th cell signaling, potentially via STAT1 and STAT3. Overall, our study highlights the inhibitory role of PIMs in human Th17 cell differentiation, thereby suggesting their association with autoimmune phenotypes.},

This strain A2879T was isolated from an abscess swab of a patient sampled during routine care at hospital. Phylogenetic analyses (full-­length 16S rRNA gene and whole-­genome sequence) revealed the strain to belong to the genus Prevotella, but to be distant from recognized species, with the closest relationship to Prevotella veroralis. Unambiguous identification also proved possible by MALDI-­TOF MS. The genomic DNA G+C content was 41.5 mol\%. Strain A2879T was moderately saccharolytic and proteolytic. The most abundant cellular long-­chain fatty acids were anteiso-C­ 15 : 0 and iso-C­ 15 : 0. In view of these data, strain A2879T is considered to represent a novel species within the genus Prevotella, for which the name Prevotella vespertina sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A2879T (=DSM 108027T=CCOS 1233T=CCUG72808T). As this strain has been isolated from a clinical sample, it is considered relevant for human medicine and health in general, and in particular for the fields of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases. This description will enable routine and research laboratories alike to easily identify the novel taxon, allowing its role in the context of human health and disease or microbiota to be further elucidated.},

 abstract = {To date, Certrevirus is one of two genera of bacteriophage (phage), with phages infecting Pectobacterium atrosepticum, an economically important phytopathogen that causes potato blackleg and soft rot disease. This study provides a detailed description of Pectobacterium phage CB7 (vB\_PatM\_CB7), which specifically infects P. atrosepticum. Host range, morphology, latent period, burst size and stability at different conditions of temperature and pH were examined. Analysis of its genome (142.8 kbp) shows that the phage forms a new species of Certrevirus, sharing sequence similarity with other members, highlighting conservation within the genus. Conserved elements include a putative early promoter like that of the Escherichia coli sigma70 promoter, which was found to be shared with other genus members. A number of dissimilarities were observed, relating to DNA methylation and nucleotide metabolism. Some members do not have homologues of a cytosine methylase and anaerobic nucleotide reductase subunits NrdD and NrdG, respectively. Furthermore, the genome of CB7 contains one of the largest numbers of homing endonucleases described in a single phage genome in the literature to date, with a total of 23 belonging to the HNH and LAGLIDADG families. Analysis by RT-PCR of the HNH homing endonuclease residing within introns of genes for the large terminase, DNA polymerase, ribonucleotide reductase subunits NrdA and NrdB show that they are splicing competent. Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was also performed on the virion of CB7, allowing the identification of 26 structural proteins\&mdash;20 of which were found to be shared with the type phages of the genera of Vequintavirus and Seunavirus. The results of this study provide greater insights into the phages of the Certrevirus genus as well as the subfamily Vequintavirinae.},

Therefore, evaluation of novel antimicrobial drugs is needed to identify potential treatments with better outcomes. We evaluated the in vitro activity of novel antimicrobial drugs/combinations against 97 KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from different hospitals in Brazil during 2021–2022. Clonality, resistance and virulence genes were detected by whole-genome sequencing. The majority of the isolates (54.6\%) were classified as extensively drug resistant or multidrug resistant (44.3\%); one isolate showed a pandrug resistance phenotype. The most active antimicrobial agents were meropenem-vaborbactam, cefiderocol, and ceftazidime-avibactam, with sensitivities higher than 90\%; resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam was associated with KPC-33 or KPC-44 variants. Colistin and polymyxin B were active against 58.6\% of the isolates. The 97 isolates were distributed into 17 different sequence types, with a predominance of ST11 (37.4\%). Although high in vitro susceptibility rates were detected for meropenem-vaborbactam and cefiderocol, only ceftazidime-avibactam is currently available in Brazil. Our findings showed limited susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs employed for infection treatment of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, underscoring the urgent need for stringent policies for antimicrobial stewardship to preserve the activity of such drugs.},

In recent years, the frequency of carbapenemases in P. aeruginosa has decreased, which allows use of new beta-lactams/combinations in antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, the in vitro evaluation of these drugs in contemporary isolates is warranted. We evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility and genomic aspects of 119 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from 24 different hospitals in Brazil in 2021–2022. Identification was performed via MALDI-TOF-MS, and antimicrobial susceptibility was identified through broth microdilution, gradient tests, or disk diffusion. Whole-genome sequencing was carried out using NextSeq equipment. The most active drug was cefiderocol (100\%), followed by ceftazidime–avibactam (94.1\%), ceftolozane–tazobactam (92.4\%), and imipenem–relebactam (81.5\%). Imipenem susceptibility was detected in 59 isolates (49.6\%), and the most active aminoglycoside was tobramycin, to which 99 (83.2\%) isolates were susceptible. Seventy-one different sequence types (STs) were detected, including twelve new STs described herein. The acquired resistance genes blaCTX-M-2 and blaKPC-2 were identified in ten (8.4\%) and two (1.7\%) isolates, respectively. Several virulence genes (exoSTUY, toxA, aprA, lasA/B, plcH) were also identified. We found that new antimicrobials are effective against the diverse P. aeruginosa population that has been circulating in Brazilian hospitals in recent years.},

 abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequent extracranial solid tumour in childhood. The clinical diagnosis of NB is difficult due to the age of the patient and the vague appearance of the symptoms. Moreover, there are two groups of aggressive NBs, one with MYCN amplification and the other with an 11q deletion. Some genes could be a candidate suppressor for NB, e.g., the DLG2 gene that resides within the 11q-deleted region. The DLG2 gene has a large number of exons and multiple isoforms depending on the alternative splicing process. Moreover, these isoforms can include the L27 domain or not. This study aimed to analyse, by applying bioinformatic tools, if isoform 2, which does not have L27 domain, could be a candidate suppressor for this disease. RNA-seq samples from different human cell lines were collected from NCBI and a quality analysis was performed. The filtered samples were run in R and Python programs to do a visualization of the exon expression level and the prediction of Rsubread for exon-exon junctions. The results showed that isoform 2 of DLG2 gene was not expressed in the samples of NB, which is a promising result for being a candidate suppressor of NB. Furthermore, the prediction of exon-exon junctions by Rsubread was confirmed to be very accurate. In conclusion, this study shows that isoform 2 of DLG2 gene could be a candidate tumour suppressor in NB that could, in the future, be used as a target to help to detect earlier the presence of NB and increase the life expectancy of children who suffer from this disease.},

@phdthesis{cantarella_insights_2020,
 abstract = {A large portion of the human genome is composed of repeated sequences, with Alu retrotransposons representing the most abundant repetitive elements. Alu sequences belong to the class of the Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) and depend on the Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) for their mobilization into the genome. The efficiency of Alu amplification during primate evolution suggests a positive driving force for their accumulation, bringing up to 1 million copies in the human genome. For unclear reasons, the majority of Alu sequences is repressed by tight epigenetic silencing, which is released in response to cell stresses such as virus infection and cancer progression. Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is known to cause an increase of Alu transcription in HeLa, myelogenous leukemia and embryonic kidney cell lines, even though the virus factors that are responsible for this transcriptional enhancement have not been identified yet. Potential candidates could be represented by oncovirus proteins that induce a global remodeling of the host epigenetic landscape. For example, the Adenovirus early E1A protein interacts with the host tumor suppressor Rb, the lysine acetylase p300 and the p400 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, resulting in the induction of quiescent fibroblasts to enter the S-phase of the cell cycle. 
The exceptional success of Alu expansion and their retention even at the cost of a strong epigenetic silencing, which is released by virus infection, led us to investigate the molecular mechanism of Alus activation and their potential involvement in various cell processes.  
Firstly, genome-wide Alu profiling was performed in quiescent human primary fibroblasts infected with the Ad5 dl1500 mutant, which only expresses the oncovirus small E1A protein. A total of 1880 Polymerase III (Pol III) transcribed Alus were detected through high throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), revealing a 4-fold increase of the average Alu expression induced by small E1A.   
With the aim of identifying small E1A-host protein interactions that are crucial for the activation of Alu expression, the host proteins Rb, p300 and p400 were put under investigation. Alu expression profiling was performed in cells infected with small E1A mutants that are not capable to bind Rb, p300 or p400. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data revealed that the small E1A-p400 binding mutant was the least efficient in activating Alu expression, whereas a milder effect was reported for small E1A-Rb and small E1A-p300 binding mutants. Moreover, ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of dl1500 infected fibroblasts revealed an enrichment of H3K4me1 within the body of small E1A-induced Alus. Our data point toward the existence of H3K4me1 Alu loci that are recognized by p400 bound by small E1A, resulting in Alu transcription in response to virus infection. 
Secondly, two Alu sequences were stably overexpressed in one primary and one cancer cell line (human fibroblasts and HeLa cells, respectively) and differential gene expression in Alu-overexpressing cells was performed through RNA-seq data analysis. Among the two Alu- overexpressing fibroblast cell lines, 330 genes were detected as Differentially Expressed (DE), whereas only two genes were differentially expressed in HeLa cells. Interestingly, DE genes detected in Alu-overexpressing fibroblasts were significantly enriched in pathways belonging to cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. The promotion of cell cycle was also supported by a significantly higher percentage of cells in the S-phase compared to control samples as revealed by flow cytometry.  
The studies conducted in this work identify Ad5 small E1A as one of the virus factors that enhance Alu transcription, possibly through binding with the p400 complex. Interestingly, the overexpression of two Alu sequences in human fibroblasts leads to the stimulation of cell cycle progression, resulting in the same phenotype as previously observed in Ad5 infected fibroblasts. This brings us to speculate that the overexpression of Alu sequences during stress response to viral infection could be exploited by Ad5 to sustain cell proliferation.},

 abstract = {Providencia stuartii is a member of the Morganellaceae family, notorious for its intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics, including last-resort drugs such as colistin and tigecycline. Between February and March 2022, a four-patient outbreak sustained by P. stuartii occurred in a hospital in Rome. Phenotypic analyses defined these strains as eXtensively Drug-Resistant (XDR). Whole-genome sequencing was performed on the representative P. stuartii strains and resulted in fully closed genomes and plasmids. The genomes were highly related phylogenetically and encoded various virulence factors, including fimbrial clusters. The XDR phenotype was primarily driven by the presence of the blaNDM-1 metallo-β-lactamase alongside the rmtC 16S rRNA methyltransferase, conferring resistance to most β-lactams and every aminoglycoside, respectively. These genes were found on an IncC plasmid that was highly related to an NDM-IncC plasmid retrieved from a ST15 Klebsiella pneumoniae strain circulating in the same hospital two years earlier. Given its ability to acquire resistance plasmids and its intrinsic resistance mechanisms, P. stuartii is a formidable pathogen. The emergence of XDR P. stuartii strains poses a significant public health threat. It is essential to monitor the spread of these strains and develop new strategies for their control and treatment.},

In the face of these variations, plants sense temperature to adjust their functions and minimize the negative consequences. Transcriptome responses underlie changes in growth, development, and biochemistry (thermomorphogenesis and acclimation to extreme temperatures). We are only beginning to understand temperature sensation by plants. Multiple thermosensors convey complementary temperature information to a given signaling network to control gene expression. Temperature-induced changes in protein or transcript structure and/or in the dynamics of biomolecular condensates are the core sensing mechanisms of known thermosensors, but temperature impinges on their activities via additional indirect pathways. The diversity of plant responses to temperature anticipates that many new thermosensors and eventually novel sensing mechanisms will be uncovered soon.},

Pannonibacter spp. is an environmental Gram-negative bacterium not commonly associated with nosocomial infections. Species identification was performed using Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) for both strains. Genomic analyses for the two isolates, BLAST similarity search, and phylogeny for the 16S rDNA sequences lead to an assignment to the species Pannonibacter phragmitetus. However, by performing ANIb, ANIm, tetranucleotide correlation, and DNA-DNA digital hybridization, analyses of the two draft genomes showed that they were very different from those of the species P. phragmitetus. MALDI-TOF analysis, assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility by E-test method, and Analytical Profile Index (API) tests were also performed. This result highlights how environmental bacterial species can easily adapt to the human host and, especially in nosocomial environments, also gain pathogenic potential through antimicrobial resistance.},

@article{cermak_unexpected_2020,
 abstract = {In plants, posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is induced by small RNAs (sRNAs) generated from various dsRNA precursors. To assess the impact of dsRNA origin, we compared downregulation of GFP expression triggered by inverted repeat (IR), antisense (AS) and unterminated sense (UT) transcripts transiently expressed from the estradiol-inducible promoter. The use of homogeneously responding tobacco BY-2 cell lines allowed monitoring the onset of silencing and its reversibility. In this system, IR induced the strongest and fastest silencing accompanied by dense DNA methylation. At low induction, silencing in individual cells was binary (either strong or missing), suggesting that a certain threshold sRNA level had to be exceeded. The AS variant specifically showed a deviated sRNA-strand ratio shifted in favor of antisense orientation. In AS lines and weakly induced IR lines, only the silencer DNA was methylated, but the same target GFP sequence was not, showing that DNA methylation accompanying PTGS was influenced both by the level and origin of sRNAs, and possibly also by the epigenetic state of the locus. UT silencing appeared to be the least effective and resembled classical sense PTGS. The best responding UT lines behaved relatively heterogeneously possibly due to complexly arranged T-DNA insertions. Unlike IR and AS variants that fully restored GFP expression upon removal of the inducer, only partial reactivation was observed in some UT lines. Our results pointed out several not yet described phenomena and differences between the long-known silencer variants that may direct further research and affect selection of proper silencer variants for specific applications.},

Variant analysis identified 188 variable single-nucleotide loci in the coding sequences of sage terpenoid biosynthesis genes. A total of 24,570 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the common sage total exome, representing a database of potential variable loci for targeted genotyping research. Given that terpene synthase activity is highly prone to modulation by point mutations and that the genotype plays an important role in the complex traits of terpenoid composition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in coding sequences constitute candidate functional markers that can be associated with terpenoid compositional traits in future research.},

Kutzneria, a rare actinobacteria belonging to the family Pseudonocardiaceae has abundance of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and is one of important source of natural products and worthy of priority investigation. Currently, Kutzneria chonburiensis SMC256T has been the latest type-strain of the genus and its genome sequence has not been reported yet. Therefore, we present the first report of new complete genome sequence of SMC256T (genome size of 10.4 Mbp) with genome annotation and feature comparison between SMC256T and other publicly available Kutzneria species. The results from comparative and functional genomic analyses regarding the phylogenomic and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) analyses indicated that SMC256T is most closely related to Kutzneria sp. 744, Kutzneria kofuensis, Kutzneria sp. CA-103260 and Kutzneria buriramensis. Furthermore, a total of 322 BGCs were also detected and showed diversity among the Kutzneria genomes. Out of which, 38 clusters showing the best hit to the most known BGCs were predicted in the SMC256Tgenome. We observed that six clusters responsible for biosynthesis of antimicrobials/antitumor metabolites were strain-specific in Kutzneria chonburiensis. These putative metabolites include virginiamycin S1, lysolipin I, esmeraldin, rakicidin, aclacinomycin and streptoseomycin. Based on these findings, the genome of Kutzneria chonburiensis contains distinct and unidentified BGCs different from other members of the genus, and the use of integrative genomic-based approach would be a useful alternative effort to target, isolate and identify putative and undiscovered secondary metabolites suspected to have new and/or specific bioactivity in the Kutzneria.},

Although this TF family has been examined in a multitude of plants, the R2R3-MYB TFs in Ficus carica, a Mediterranean fruit species, have yet to be characterized. This study identified and classified 63 R2R3-MYB genes (FcMYB1 to FcMYB63) in the F. carica genome. We analyzed these genes for physicochemical properties, conserved motifs, phylogenetic relationships, gene architecture, selection pressure, and gene expression profiles and networks. The genes were classified into 29 clades, with members of the same clade showing similar exon–intron structures and motif compositions. Of the 54 orthologous gene pairs shared with mulberry (Morus notabilis), 52 evolved under negative selection, while two pairs (FcMYB55/MnMYB20 and FcMYB59/MnMYB31) experienced diversifying selection. RNA-Seq analysis showed that FcMYB26, FcMYB33, and FcMYB34 were significantly overexpressed in fig fruit peel during maturation phase III. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that these genes are part of an expression module associated with the anthocyanin pathway. RT-qPCR validation confirmed these findings and revealed that the Tunisian cultivars 'Zidi' and 'Soltani' have cultivar-specific R2R3-FcMYB genes highly overexpressed during the final stage of fruit maturation and color acquisition. These genes likely influence cultivar-specific pigment synthesis. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the R2R3-MYB TF family in fig, offering a framework for selecting genes related to fruit peel color in breeding programs.},

 abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) is central in prostate tissue identity and differentiation, and controls normal growth-suppressive, prostate-specific gene expression. It also drives prostate tumorigenesis when hijacked for oncogenic transcription. The execution of growth-suppressive AR transcriptional programs in prostate cancer (PCa) and the potential for reactivation remain unclear. Here, we use a genome-wide approach to modulate canonical androgen response element (ARE) motifs—the classic DNA binding elements for AR—to delineate distinct AR transcriptional programs. We find that activating these AREs promotes differentiation and growth-suppressive transcription, potentially leading to AR+ PCa cell death, while ARE repression is tolerated by PCa cells but deleterious to normal prostate cells. Gene signatures driven by ARE activity correlate with improved prognosis and luminal phenotypes in PCa patients. Canonical AREs maintain a normal, lineage-specific transcriptional program that can be reengaged in PCa cells, offering therapeutic potential and clinical relevance.},

 abstract = {The risk of developing drug addiction is strongly influenced by the epigenetic landscape and chromatin remodeling. While histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation have been studied in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens (NAc), the role of H2A monoubiquitination remains unknown. Our investigations, initially focused on the scaffold protein melanoma-associated antigen D1 (Maged1), reveal that H2A monoubiquitination in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) significantly contributes to cocaine-adaptive behaviors and transcriptional repression induced by cocaine. Chronic cocaine use increases H2A monoubiquitination, regulated by Maged1 and its partner USP7. Accordingly, Maged1 specific inactivation in thalamic Vglut2 neurons, or USP7 inhibition, blocks cocaine-evoked H2A monoubiquitination and cocaine locomotor sensitization. Additionally, genetic variations in MAGED1 and USP7 are linked to altered susceptibility to cocaine addiction and cocaine-associated symptoms in humans. These findings unveil an epigenetic modification in a non-canonical reward pathway of the brain and a potent marker of epigenetic risk factors for drug addiction in humans.},

@article{cherrad_new_2023,
 abstract = {Downy mildew is caused by Plasmopara viticola, an obligate oomycete plant pathogen, a devasting disease of grapevine. To protect plants from the disease, complex III inhibitors are among the fungicides widely used. They specifically target the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) of the pathogen to block cellular respiration mechanisms. In the French vineyard, P. viticola has developed resistance against a first group of these fungicides, the Quinone outside Inhibitors (QoI), with a single amino acid substitution G143A in its cytb mitochondrial sequence. The use of QoI was limited and another type of fungicide, the Quinone inside Inhibitors, targeting the same gene and highly effective against oomycetes, was used instead. Recently however, less sensitive P. viticola populations were detected after treatments with some inhibitors, in particular ametoctradin and cyazofamid. By isolating single-sporangia P. viticola strains resistant to these fungicides, we characterized new variants in the cytb sequences associated with cyazofamid resistance: a point mutation (L201S) and more strikingly, two insertions (E203-DE-V204, E203-VE-V204). In parallel with the classical tools, pyrosequencing and qPCR, we then benchmarked short and long-reads NGS technologies (Ion Torrent, Illumina, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to sequence the complete cytb with a view to detecting and assessing the proportion of resistant variants of P. viticola at the scale of a field population. Eighteen populations collected from French vineyard fields in 2020 were analysed: 12 showed a variable proportion of G143A, 11 of E203-DE-V204 and 7 populations of the S34L variant that confers resistance to ametoctradin. Interestingly, the long reads were able to identify variants, including SNPs, with confidence and to detect a small proportion of P. viticola with multiple variants along the same cytb sequence. Overall, NGS appears to be a promising method for assessing fungicide resistance of pathogens linked to cytb modifications at the field population level. This approach could rapidly become a robust decision support tool for resistance management in the future.},

 abstract = {Gall mites (Eriophyoidea) are cosmopolitan microscopic phytoparasites that often transmit viruses and induce gallogenesis. The tribe Calacarini is diagnosed by a set of plesiomorphic and homoplastic traits, including elimination of setae sc shared with other lineages of Eriophyoidea. We reviewed data on the generic diversity of calacarines, revised the concept of the type genus Calacarus Keifer 1940, and proposed three zones (MZ, SMZ, LZ) in the prodorsal shields of calacarines to simplify descriptions of their shield patterns. We describe three new calacarine species (Calacarus baviensisn. sp., C. burchelliaen. sp., and Viginticus searsiaen. sp.) from indigenous dicotyledonous trees from South Africa and Vietnam and report on new findings of Paracalacarus podocarpi Keifer in Brazil, Jiangsuacarus sp. in the USA, and Calacarus pusillus Pye in Latvia and Russia. The latter represents the new most northern locality of Calacarini. Reinvestigating the type species of Jaranasia Chandrapatya \& Boczek 2000 revealed that absence of setae l’’ II is the only character separating it from Jiangsuacarus Xue 2009. We proposed two new combinations: Jiangsuacarus sesleriae (Skoracka 2004) n. comb. (transferred from Jaranasia) and Procalacarus mussaendae (Keifer 1977) n. comb. (transferred from Calacarus). Partial sequences of Cox1 and 28S genes were obtained for six calacarines, some of them originating from old ethanol material kept at room temperature. Molecular phylogenetics revealed a stable cluster of “true” calacarine sequences comprising Calacarus, Jaranasia, Latitudo, and Viginticus and a polyphyletic group of erroneous sequences assigned to Calacarini in GenBank. All investigated females of calacarines have a pair of genital tubules associated with the vestibulum and hypothesized to participate in fertilization. This finding may contribute to resolving the question on how the fusion of gametes happens in gall mites.},

 abstract = {Venomous marine gastropods of the superfamily Conoidea possess a rich arsenal of toxins, including neuroactive toxins. Venom adaptations might have played a fundamental role in the radiation of conoideans; nevertheless, there is still no knowledge about the venom of the most diversified family of the group: Raphitomidae Bellardi, 1875. In this study, transcriptomes were produced from the carcase, salivary glands, and proximal and distal venom ducts of the northeastern Atlantic species Raphitoma purpurea (Montagu, 1803). Using a gut barcoding approach, we were also able to report, for the first time, molecular evidence of a vermivorous diet for the genus. Transcriptomic analyses revealed over a hundred putative venom components (PVC), including 69 neurotoxins. Twenty novel toxin families, including some with high levels of expansion, were discovered. No significant difference was observed between the distal and proximal venom duct secretions. Peptides related to cone snail toxins (Cerm06, Pgam02, and turritoxin) and other venom-related proteins (disulfide isomerase and elevenin) were retrieved from the salivary glands. These salivary venom components may constitute ancestral adaptations for venom production in conoideans. Although often neglected, salivary gland secretions are of extreme importance for understanding the evolutionary history of conoidean venom.},

 abstract = {Various next generation sequencing (NGS) based strategies have been successfully used in the recent past for tracing origins and understanding the evolution of infectious agents, investigating the spread and transmission chains of outbreaks, as well as facilitating the development of effective and rapid molecular diagnostic tests and contributing to the hunt for treatments and vaccines. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses one of the greatest global threats in modern history and has already caused severe social and economic costs. The development of efficient and rapid sequencing methods to reconstruct the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been fundamental for the design of diagnostic molecular tests and to devise effective measures and strategies to mitigate the diffusion of the pandemic.Diverse approaches and sequencing methods can, as testified by the number of available sequences, be applied to SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, each technology and sequencing approach has its own advantages and limitations. In the current review, we will provide a brief, but hopefully comprehensive, account of currently available platforms and methodological approaches for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We also present an outline of current repositories and databases that provide access to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and associated metadata. Finally, we offer general advice and guidelines for the appropriate sharing and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 data and metadata, and suggest that more efficient and standardized integration of current and future SARS-CoV-2-related data would greatly facilitate the struggle against this new pathogen. We hope that our ‘vademecum’ for the production and handling of SARS-CoV-2-related sequencing data, will contribute to this objective.},

The fungus infects only the flowers of camellias causing serious damage to the plant, particularly from an aesthetic point of view. The disease has been reported in almost all countries where camellia is grown for ornamental purposes, but there are not many studies on the variability of the population of this phytopathogen. The main objective of this study was to contribute to study the level of variability within the Italian population. More than 130 C. camelliae strains were collected from six localities distributed in five Italian regions and identified also based on molecular characterization of the ITS nucleotide sequences. The population variability was assessed by comparing the morphological characters. From a phenological point of view, 11 different colony morphotypes were identified, whose presence/absence and frequency are different in the various locations considered. The study of the taxonomically valid nucleotide sequences to differentiate fungi at the species level confirmed that the strains under study belong to a single species. To further investigate Italian population of C. camelliae we sequenced by a combination of long and short reads technologies the genome of a representative strain. This genome represents a worldwide reference for future C. cameliae diversity and pathogenicity studies.},

The use of integrative phenotype-focused -omics technologies such as proteomics and lipidomics provides an unbiased approach to explore the molecular evolution of the tumor and its associated environment.We assembled a cohort of patient-matched initial (iGBM) and recurrent (rGBM) specimens of resected GBM. Proteome and metabolome composition were determined by mass spectrometry-based techniques. We performed neutrophil-GBM cell coculture experiments to evaluate the behavior of rGBM-enriched proteins in the tumor microenvironment. ELISA-based quantitation of candidate proteins was performed to test the association of their plasma concentrations in iGBM with the onset of recurrence.Proteomic profiles reflect increased immune cell infiltration and extracellular matrix reorganization in rGBM. ASAH1, SYMN, and GPNMB were highly enriched proteins in rGBM. Lipidomics indicates the downregulation of ceramides in rGBM. Cell analyses suggest a role for ASAH1 in neutrophils and its localization in extracellular traps. Plasma concentrations of ASAH1 and SYNM show an association with time to recurrence.We describe the potential importance of ASAH1 in tumor progression and development of rGBM via metabolic rearrangement and showcase the feedback from the tumor microenvironment to plasma proteome profiles. We report the potential of ASAH1 and SYNM as plasma markers of rGBM progression. The published datasets can be considered as a resource for further functional and biomarker studies involving additional -omics technologies.},

In the current study electrophysiology, histology, and transcriptomics were used to explore the impact of exposure to CO2 acidified water on the olfactory epithelium (OE) of the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). The upper and lower OE in this asymmetric species detect different odorants and are in contact with different ecological environments making it an excellent experimental model.

Differential regulation of genes related to neurogenesis, plasticity, and immune processes occurred in both OE. In the upper OE differential expressed genes (DEGs) were related to inflammation and innate immune processes while in the lower OE DEGs were related to the adaptative immune response. We suggest that exposure to acidified water decreases olfactory sensitivity, and as a consequence, mechanisms of neuromodulation and plasticity are activated.

Here, we characterize PCI domain-containing 2 (PCID2) protein, a subunit of the transcription and export complex 2 (TREX2) complex, to enforce transcriptional repression and post-transcriptional blocks to HIV-1 gene expression during latency. PCID2 bound the latent HIV-1 LTR (long terminal repeat) and repressed transcription initiation during latency. Depletion of PCID2 remodeled the chromatin landscape at the HIV-1 promoter and resulted in transcriptional activation and latency reversal. Immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry identified PCID2-interacting proteins to include negative viral RNA (vRNA) splicing regulators, and PCID2 depletion resulted in over-splicing of intron-containing vRNA in cell lines and primary cells obtained from PWH. MCM3AP and DSS1, two other RNA-binding TREX2 complex subunits, also inhibit transcription initiation and vRNA alternative splicing during latency. Thus, PCID2 is a novel HIV-1 latency-promoting factor, which in context of the TREX2 sub-complex PCID2-DSS1-MCM3AP blocks transcription and dysregulates vRNA processing.},

 abstract = {Cave animals are an excellent model system for studying adaptive evolution. At present, however, little is known about the mechanisms that enable surface colonizers to survive in the challenging environment of caves. One possibility is that these species have the necessary genetic background to respond with plastic changes to the pressures of underground habitats. To gain insight into this process, we conducted a comparative study with the fish species Telestes karsticus, which occurs in a hydrological system consisting of an interconnected stream and a cave. Results showed that T. karsticus resided year-round and spawned in Sušik cave, making it the first known cavefish in the Dinaric Karst. Cave and surface populations differed in morphological and physiological characteristics, as well as in patterns of gene expression without any evidence of genetic divergence. To test whether observed trait differences were plastic or genetic, we placed adult fish from both populations under light/dark or constant dark conditions. Common laboratory conditions erased all morphometric differences between the two morphs, suggesting phenotypic plasticity is driving the divergence of shape and size in wild fish. Lighter pigmentation and increased fat deposition exhibited by cave individuals were also observed in surface fish kept in the dark in the laboratory. Our study also revealed that specialized cave traits were not solely attributed to developmental plasticity, but also arose from adult responses, including acclimatization. Thus, we conclude that T. karsticus can adapt to cave conditions, with phenotypic plasticity playing an important role in the process of cave colonization.},

 abstract = {Recent studies support the assumption that mutation of the X-linked Pig-a gene is most likely responsible for the mutant phenotype of the cells deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins quantified in the rodent Pig-a gene mutation assay. In humans, however, mutations in both alleles of one of the 30 other genes involved in GPI-anchor synthesis, e.g., PIG-L and PIG-O, cause reduced expression of surface GPI-anchored proteins. Here, we investigated the possibility that the loss of the GPI-anchor detected by the rat Pig-a assay also could be caused by mutation in other GPI-biosynthesis genes. 31 samples were obtained from 8 inbred and outbred rat strains commonly used for genetic toxicology assays. In order to investigate possible sources of variation in the Pig-a assay, variant DNA sequences were evaluated in Cd59 and 24 GPI-biosynthesis genes. In some genes, such as Pig-n and Pig-u, homozygous variations occurred in all animals, suggesting that these variations are due to deviations in the reference genome. Heterozygous Pig-s, Pig-w, Pig-o, Pig-c, Pgap1, Pgap2, Pig-k and Pig-t variations were found, however, indicating that these genes could serve as targets for mutation in the assay. Protein alignment for these altered genes was conducted with possible human, mouse and rat phenotypic mutants from the literature; this analysis demonstrated that many of the variations that we detected were in non-conserved sequences and that no phenotypes for any of these variants could be inferred from known mutants from the literature. All heterozygous variants were in outbred rats. Overall, the findings of this study cannot totally rule out the possibility that mutations in GPI-biosynthesis genes other than Pig-a are detected in the Pig-a assay, but suggest that if it occurs, it must occur only rarely and therefore mutations in genes other than Pig-a have little impact on rat-based experiments.},

The Ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum (Fg) is one of the main causal agents of FHB in wheat and barley. The role(s) in virulence of Fg genes include genetic studies that involve the transformation of the fungus with different expression cassettes. We have observed in several studies where Fg genes functions were characterised that integration of expression cassettes occurred randomly. Random insertion of a cassette may disrupt gene expression and/or protein functions and hence the overall conclusion of the study. Target site integration (TSI) is an approach that consists of identifying a chromosomal region where the cassette can be inserted. The identification of a suitable locus for TSI in Fg would avert the potential risks of ectopic integration.},

@article{darkow_small_2021,
 abstract = {In search of more efficacious and safe pharmacological treatments for atrial fibrillation (AF), atria-selective antiarrhythmic agents have been promoted that target ion channels principally expressed in the atria. This concept allows one to engage antiarrhythmic effects in atria, but spares the ventricles from potentially proarrhythmic side effects. It has been suggested that cardiac small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels may represent an atria-selective target in mammals including humans. However, there are conflicting data concerning the expression of SK channels in different stages of AF, and recent findings suggest that SK channels are upregulated in ventricular myocardium when patients develop heart failure. To address this issue, RNA-sequencing was performed to compare expression levels of three SK channels (KCNN1, KCNN2, and KCNN3) in human atrial and ventricular tissue samples from transplant donor hearts (no cardiac disease), and patients with cardiac disease in sinus rhythm or with AF. In addition, for control purposes expression levels of several genes known to be either chamber-selective or differentially expressed in AF and heart failure were determined. In atria, as compared to ventricle from transplant donor hearts, we confirmed higher expression of KCNN1 and KCNA5, and lower expression of KCNJ2, whereas KCNN2 and KCNN3 were statistically not differentially expressed. Overall expression of KCNN1 was low compared to KCNN2 and KCNN3. Comparing atrial tissue from patients with AF to sinus rhythm samples we saw downregulation of KCNN2 in AF, as previously reported. When comparing ventricular tissue from heart failure patients to non-diseased samples, we found significantly increased ventricular expression of KCNN3 in heart failure, as previously published. The other channels showed no significant difference in expression in either disease. Our results add weight to the view that SK channels are not likely to be an atria-selective target, especially in failing human hearts, and modulators of these channels may prove to have less utility in treating AF than hoped. Whether targeting SK1 holds potential remains to be elucidated.},

The roadmap is the result of a workshop titled “An intrinsically disordered protein user community proposal for ELIXIR” held at the University of Padua. The workshop, and further consultation with the members of the wider IDP community, identified the key priority areas for the roadmap including the development of standards for data annotation, storage and dissemination; integration of IDP data into the ELIXIR Core Data Resources; and the creation of benchmarking criteria for IDP-related software. Here, we discuss these areas of priority, how they can be implemented in cooperation with the ELIXIR platforms, and their connections to existing ELIXIR Communities and international consortia. The article provides a preliminary blueprint for an IDP Community in ELIXIR and is an appeal to identify and involve new stakeholders.},

To date, there are few mitochondrial genomes in Arecaceae (Cocos nucifera and Phoenix dactylifera L.), and studies of the mitochondrial genome are essential to understand the evolution of the Arecaceae family. This study reports and compares the newly sequenced genome of S. coronata. Single-end and paired-end reads were used to obtain de novo contigs. The mitochondrial contigs were selected using C. nucifera as a reference and were merged using mate paired-end reads. The mitochondrial genome showed 642,817 bp, circular structure, containing 73 predicted functional genes, including four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 27 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and 42 coding protein genes. Large chloroplast genomic fragments were identified in the mitochondrial genome, and large DNA repetitive fragments were into intergenic space regions. Arecaceae mitochondrial genomes showed partial similarities in size, genome structure, and gene content. However, they exhibited numerous rearrangements. In summary, (1) we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of S. coronata and compared with other mitogenomes of Arecaceae. (2) Genomic rearrangements and gene transfer have been identified from the chloroplast genome to the mitochondrial genome. (3) The mitochondrial genome of Arecareae showed similarities in size, structure, and gene content.

They improve seedling growth by enhancing plant nutrient uptake, modulating stress-related phytohormone production, and targeting pests and pathogens with antibiotics. Seed endophyte composition can be influenced by pollination, plant cultivar, and soil physicochemical conditions. However, the effects of plant community richness on seed endophytes are unknown. To investigate the effects of increasing plant species richness on the diversity and composition of the seed microbiome, we made use of a well-established long-term biodiversity experiment in Germany (The Jena Experiment). We sampled seeds from different Plantago lanceolata blossoms in a plant diversity gradient ranging from monoculture to 16 species mixtures. The seeds were surface sterilized to remove seed surface-associated bacteria and subjected to a metabarcoding approach to assess bacterial community structure.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND:
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an acquired genetic risk factor for both leukemia and cardiovascular disease. It results in proinflammatory myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood; however, how these cells behave in the cardiovascular tissue remains unclear. Our study aimed at investigating whether CHIP-mutated macrophages accumulate preferentially in cardiovascular tissues and examining the transcriptome of tissue macrophages from DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha) or TET2 (Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) mutation carriers.
METHODS:
We recruited patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or heart surgeries to screen for CHIP mutation carriers using targeted genomic sequencing. Myeloid and lymphoid cells were isolated from blood and cardiovascular tissue collected during surgeries using flow cytometry. DNA and RNA extracted from these sorted cells were subjected to variant allele frequency measurement using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and transcriptomic profiling using bulk RNA sequencing, respectively.
RESULTS:
Using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, we detected similar variant allele frequency of CHIP in monocytes from blood and macrophages from atheromas and heart tissues, even among heart macrophages with and without CCR2 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 2) expression. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a proinflammatory gene profile of myeloid cells from DNMT3A or TET2 mutation carriers compared with those from noncarriers.
CONCLUSIONS:
Quantitatively, CHIP-mutated myeloid cells did not preferentially accumulate in cardiovascular tissues, but qualitatively, they expressed a more disease-prone phenotype.},

@article{dehghanian_zfp982_2024,
 abstract = {Background
Understanding the genetic underpinnings of protein networks conferring stemness is of broad interest for basic and translational research.
Methods
We used multi-omics analyses to identify and characterize stemness genes, and focused on the zinc finger protein 982 (Zfp982) that regulates stemness through the expression of Nanog, Zfp42, and Dppa3 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC).
Results
Zfp982 was expressed in stem cells, and bound to chromatin through a GCAGAGKC motif, for example near the stemness genes Nanog, Zfp42, and Dppa3. Nanog and Zfp42 were direct targets of ZFP982 that decreased in expression upon knockdown and increased upon overexpression of Zfp982. We show that ZFP982 expression strongly correlated with stem cell characteristics, both on the transcriptional and morphological levels. Zfp982 expression decreased with progressive differentiation into ecto-, endo- and mesodermal cell lineages, and knockdown of Zfp982 correlated with morphological and transcriptional features of differentiated cells. Zfp982 showed transcriptional overlap with members of the Hippo signaling pathway, one of which was Yap1, the major co-activator of Hippo signaling. Despite the observation that ZFP982 and YAP1 interacted and localized predominantly to the cytoplasm upon differentiation, the localization of YAP1 was not influenced by ZFP982 localization.
Conclusions
Together, our study identified ZFP982 as a transcriptional regulator of early stemness genes, and since ZFP982 is under the control of the Hippo pathway, underscored the importance of the context-dependent Hippo signals for stem cell characteristics.},

New sequencing technologies make it possible to investigate genomic variations associated with resistant phenotypes at the genome-wide scale. Based on the use of hemisynthetic nanopores, the PromethION technology from Oxford Nanopore Technologies can produce long-read sequences, in contrast to previous short-read technologies used as the gold standard to sequence Plasmodium. Two clones of P. falciparum (Pf3D7 and PfW2) were sequenced in long-read using the PromethION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies without genomic amplification. This made it possible to create a processing analysis pipeline for human Plasmodium with ONT Fastq only. De novo assembly revealed N50 lengths of 18,488 kb and 17,502 kb for the Pf3D7 and PfW2, respectively. The genome size was estimated at 23,235,407 base pairs for the Pf3D7 clone and 21,712,038 base pairs for the PfW2 clone. The average genome coverage depth was estimated at 787X and 653X for the Pf3D7 and PfW2 clones, respectively. This study proposes an assembly processing pipeline for the human Plasmodium genome using software adapted to large ONT data and the high AT percentage of Plasmodium. This search provides all the parameters which were optimized for use with the software selected in the pipeline.},

Here, we analyzed the regulatory landscape of cardiac endothelial cells by assessing chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and 3D chromatin organization and confirmed the functional relevance of enhancer-promoter interactions by CRISPRi-mediated enhancer silencing. We used this dataset to explore mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in cardiovascular disease and compared six different experimental models of heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes. Enhancers that regulate gene expression in diseased endothelial cells were enriched with binding sites for a distinct set of transcription factors, including the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a known drug target in heart failure and hypertension. For proof of concept, we applied endothelial cell-specific MR deletion in mice to confirm MR-dependent gene expression and predicted direct MR target genes. Overall, we have compiled here a comprehensive atlas of cardiac endothelial cell enhancer elements that provides insight into the role of transcription factors in cardiovascular disease.},

A stable, in vitro cardiac endothelial cell line could provide high cell numbers as needed for many epigenetic analyses and facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial cell biology. To test their suitability for transcriptomic or epigenetic studies, we compared the transcriptome of cultured immortalized mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) to primary cardiac endothelial cells (pEC). Whole transcriptome comparison of MCEC and pEC showed a correlation of 0.75–0.77. Interestingly, correlation of gene expression declined in endothelial cell-typical genes. In MCEC, we found a broad downregulation of genes that are highly expressed in pEC, including well-described markers of endothelial cell differentiation. Accordingly, systematic analysis revealed a downregulation of genes associated with typical endothelial cell functions in MCEC, while genes related to mitotic cell cycle were upregulated when compared to pEC. In conclusion, the findings from this study suggest that primary cardiac endothelial cells should preferably be used for genome-wide transcriptome or epigenome studies. The suitability of in vitro cell lines for experiments investigating single genes or signaling pathways should be carefully validated before use.},

To enable facile saturation editing of full-length genes, we used a protospacer adjacent motif–relaxed Cas9 variant and homology-directed repair to achieve above 60\% user-defined codon replacement efficiencies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Coupled with massively parallel DNA design and synthesis, we developed a saturation gene editing method termed CRISPR-Cas9– and homology-directed repair–assisted saturation editing (CHASE) and achieved highly saturated codon swapping of long genomic regions. By applying CHASE to massively edit a well-studied global transcription factor gene, we found known and unreported genetic variants affecting an industrially relevant microbial trait. The user-defined codon editing capability and wide targeting windows of CHASE substantially expand the scope of saturation gene editing.},

However, it still has ambiguous scientific multiple names, such as Azadirachta excelsa , Protium javanicum , and Dysoxylum mollissimum. Additional tools such as molecular approaches can be used to verify whether it is true or not that Kayu bawang is scientifically named as Azadirachta excelsa based on previous morphological identification. This study aimed to construct draft chloroplast genome and verify the scientific name based on molecular identification using a single rbc L gene marker. Genomic DNA was extracted from bark cambium originated from three different provenances in Bengkulu, Indonesia, namely TBT-A, TBT-K, and TBT-S. MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies was used to sequence the samples following manufacture protocols SQK-LSK109 yielding 481.6 Mb for TBT-A, 597.4 Mb for TBT-K, and 853.1 Mb for TBT-S, respectively. Generated data were assembled and constructed, namely 58,780 bp (14 tRNAs and 47 encoding genes) for TBT-A, 142,139 bp (4 rRNAs, 24 tRNAs, and 78 encoding genes) for TBT-K, and 84,906 bp (24 tRNAs and 53 encoding genes) for TBT-S. Based on the phylogenetic tree, Azadirachta excelsa from three identified tree stands were placed in the same group with other Azadirachta excelsa accessions.},

As a possible mitigating factor for the consequences of prolonged drought periods, above and belowground biodiversity can increase ecosystem resistance and resilience by improving metabolic redundancy and complementarity as biodiversity increases. Here, we investigated the interaction effect between plant richness and successive, simulated summer drought on soil microbial communities during a period of 9 years.To do that, we made use of a well-established biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) to investigate the response of microbial richness and community composition to successive drought periods alongside a plant richness gradient, which covers 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 60-species plant communities. Plots were covered from natural precipitation by installing rain shelters 6 weeks every summer. Bulk soil samples were collected 1 year after the last summer drought was simulated. Our data indicate that bacterial richness increased after successive exposure to drought, with the increase being stable along the plant richness gradient. We identified a significant effect of plant species richness on the soil microbial community composition and determined the taxa significantly impacted by drought at each plant richness level. Our data successfully demonstrates that summer drought might have a legacy effect on soil bacterial communities.},

In a pan-cancer analysis, we curated and analysed 3,412 nonstop mutations from 62 tumour entities, generating a comprehensive database at http://NonStopDB.dkfz.de. Six different nonstop extension mutations affected the tumour suppressor SMAD4, extending its carboxy terminus by 40 amino acids. These caused rapid degradation of the SMAD4 mutants via the ubiquitin–proteasome system. A hydrophobic degron signal sequence of ten amino acids within the carboxy-terminal extension was required to induce complete loss of the SMAD4 protein.

We collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of paired APA and concurrent aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCCs) (n = 6).DNA methylation levels were evaluated by quantitative bisulfite next-generation sequencing in fresh-frozen tissues (CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17A1, CYP21A2, HSD3B1, HSD3B2, NR5A1, STAR, and TSPO) and FFPE APA/APCC paired samples (CYP11B2). CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17, CYP21, and STAR gene expressions were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.The main outcome measure was DNA methylation.CYP11B2 methylation levels were significantly lower in APA than in other adrenal tissues (P \&lt; .001). Methylation levels of the remaining genes were comparable among groups. Overall, CYP11B2 expression and DNA methylation were negatively correlated (ρ = –0.379; P = .003). In FFPE-paired APA/APCC samples, CYP11B2 methylation level was significantly lower in APA than in concurrent APCCs (P = .028).DNA methylation plays a regulatory role for CYP11B2 expression and may contribute to aldosterone hypersecretion in APA. Lower CYP11B2 methylation levels in APA than in APCCs may suggest an APCC-to-APA switch via progressive CYP11B2 demethylation. Conversely, DNA methylation seems not to be relevant in regulating the expression of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes other than CYP11B2.},

 abstract = {Sheep farming represents an important type of extensive livestock farming in Croatia. Studying the genetic variability of sheep is becoming increasingly crucial, especially considering the small effective population sizes of our indigenous sheep breeds. These small populations can result in reduced genetic diversity, which may increase the risk of negative genetic anomalies and reduce the herd's resistance to diseases or other environmental stressors. This study, for the first time, analyzed gender variability at the molecular level by examining the entire mitogenome of 23 individuals representing eight indigenous sheep breeds (Cres Island sheep, Dalmatian Pramenka sheep, Dubrovnik Ruda sheep, Istrian sheep, Krk sheep, Lika sheep, Pag sheep, and Rab sheep) and two mouflons from Croatia. Using bioinformatics tools, mitogenomes with an average coverage depth of 1626 were extracted from the whole genomes of sheep and mouflons at 12x coverage, and mitogenomes with an average coverage depth of 1851 were extracted from genomes at 30x coverage. The fasta set of 25 mitogenomes, with a length of 16616 bp, consisted of 247 singletons and 112 parsimony-informative sites, comprising 24 haplotypes with a haplotype diversity of 0.997. This provided valuable information about high genetic diversity both within and between our sheep breeds and mouflons. For a more detailed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis of the mitogenomes, these 25 mitogenomes were analyzed alongside an additional 348 mitogenomes from various sheep breeds worldwide from the GenBank repository. The median-joining network revealed that all haplotypes of our indigenous sheep breeds and Croatian mouflons belong to haplogroup B. Interestingly, one Krk sheep haplotype belonged to haplogroup A, and one Dubrovnik Ruda sheep haplotype belonged to haplogroup C. Bayesian-based Beast phylogenetic analysis also confirmed the membership of these haplotypes in haplogroups A, B, and C, with posterior probabilities of 1 for the branching of these haplogroups. The phylogeographic distribution of haplogroups confirmed a high frequency of haplogroup A in breeds from Central and Eastern Asia, and a high frequency of haplogroup B in Europe and Anatolia. Rare haplogroups C were found in the Pyrenees, the Middle East, the Caspian Sea region, China, India, and Nepal, while haplogroups D and E were present in the Middle East. The haplotypes of our mouflons were grouped into haplogroup B, along with other European mouflons. The presence of two haplotypes attributed to haplogroups A and C suggests migratory contacts between the Balkans and the Middle East, which require further investigation.},

@article{diz-kucukkaya_jak2v617f_2024,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It has been shown that clonal mutations occur in hematopoietic stem cells with advancing age and increase the risk of death due to atherosclerotic vascular diseases, similarly to myeloproliferative neoplasms. Endothelial cells (ECs) and hematopoietic stem cells develop from common stem cells called hemangioblasts in the early embryonic period. However, the presence of hemangioblasts in the postnatal period is controversial. In this study, JAK2 gene variants were examined in patients with atherosclerotic carotid disease and without any hematological malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients (8 men and 2 women) with symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis were included in this study. ECs (CD31+CD45-) were separated from tissue samples taken by carotid endarterectomy. JAK2 variants were examined in ECs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and oral epithelial cells of the patients with next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 74 (range: 58-80) years and the median body mass index value was 24.44 (range: 18.42-30.85) kg/m2. Smoking history was present in 50\%, hypertension in 80\%, diabetes in 70\%, and ischemic heart disease in 70\% of the cases. The JAK2V617F mutation was detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 3 of the 10 patients, and 2 patients also had the JAK2V617F mutation in their ECs. The JAK2V617F mutation was not found in the oral epithelial cells of any of the patients.
CONCLUSION: In this study, for the first time in the literature, we showed that the JAK2V617F mutation was found somatically in both peripheral blood cells and ECs in patients with atherosclerosis. This finding may support that ECs and hematopoietic cells originate from a common clone or that somatic mutations can be transmitted to ECs by other mechanisms. Examining the molecular and functional changes caused by the JAK2V617F mutation in ECs may help open a new avenue for treating atherosclerosis.},

 abstract = {Necrosis- and ethylene-inducing proteins are effector molecules of microorganisms able to induce cell death in plant tissues and/or ethylene biosynthesis. The fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, which causes the witches' broom disease in Theobroma cacao, contains five genes that encode these proteins (MpNep1-5) in its genome. Among these, MpNep2 is the most expressed Nep during disease's development, especially in the necrotic phase. Although widely studied, little is known about the mechanisms by which these proteins induce cell death. In this perspective, the present study aimed to identify potential MpNEP2 target proteins in protein extracts of Theobroma cacao (genotype Catongo) and propose, from the results achieved, mechanisms by which MpNEP2 can induce the process of cell death. Molecular targets captured in vitro by rMpNEP2 immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose were identified by ms/ms. Candidate targets were identified as an Auxin Response Factor, Sphingosine Kinase and a Formin like protein. These proteins are known to participate in important processes in primary metabolism, molecular function and regulation of the plant's response. The targets:MpNEP2 interactions were validated in silico. We discussed the different signaling pathways, membrane modulation and cell cytoskeleton, by which MpNEP2 can act and induce responses in the plant that leads to necrosis.},

 abstract = {Clinical metaproteomics reveals host-microbiome interactions underlying diseases. However, challenges to this approach exist. In particular, the characterization of microbial proteins present in low abundance relative to host proteins is difficult. Other significant challenges are attributed to using very large protein sequence databases, which impedes sensitivity and accuracy during peptide and protein identification from mass spectrometry data in addition to retrieving taxonomy and functional annotations and performing statistical analysis. To address these problems, we present an integrated bioinformatics workflow for mass spectrometry-based metaproteomics that combines custom protein sequence database generation, peptide-spectrum match generation and verification, quantification, taxonomic and functional annotations, and statistical analysis. This workflow also offers characterization of human proteins (while prioritizing microbial proteins), thus offering insights into host-microbe dynamics in disease. The tools and workflow are deployed in the Galaxy ecosystem, enabling the development, optimization, and dissemination of these computational resources. We have applied this workflow for metaproteomic analysis of numerous clinical sample types, such as nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Here, we demonstrate its utility via the analysis of residual fluid from cervical swabs. The complete workflow and accompanying training resources are accessible on the Galaxy Training Network to equip non-experts and experienced researchers with the necessary knowledge and tools to analyze their data.},

 abstract = {Influenza type A virus (IAV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during influenza epidemics. Recently, a specific link between IAV infection and neurodegenerative disease progression has been established. The non-structural NS1 protein of IAV regulates viral replication during infection and antagonizes host antiviral responses, contributing to influenza virulence. In the present study, we have prepared a mouse lung-to-lung adapted to the NS1-truncated virus (NS80ad). Transcriptome analysis of the gene expression in the lungs revealed that infection with wild-type A/WSN/33 (WSN), NS80, and NS80ad viruses resulted in different regulation of genes involved in signaling pathways associated with the cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and development of neurodegenerative diseases. NS1 protein did not influence the genes involved in the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway in the brains. Lethal infection with IAVs dysregulated expression of proteins associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases (CX3CL1/Fractalkine, Coagulation factor III, and CD105/Endoglin, CD54/ICAM-1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, IGFBP-5, IGFBP-6, chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Osteopontin (OPN), cystatin C, and LDL R). Transcription of GATA3 mRNA was decreased, and expression of MPO was inhibited in the brain infected with NS80 and NS80ad viruses. In addition, the truncation of NS1 protein led to reduced expression of IGFBP-2, CHI3L1, MPO, and LDL-R proteins in the brains. Our results indicate that the influenza virus influences the expression of proteins involved in brain function, and this might occur mostly through the NS1 protein. These findings suggest that the abovementioned proteins represent a promising target for the development of potentially effective immunotherapy against neurodegeneration.},

 abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the major causes of cancer-associated deaths worldwide, with a dismal prognosis that has not significantly changed over the last decades. Transcriptional analysis has provided valuable insights into pancreatic tumorigenesis. Specifically, pancreatic cancer subtypes were identified, characterized by specific mutations and gene expression changes associated with differences in patient survival. In addition to differentially regulated mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were shown to have subtype-specific expression patterns. Hence, we aimed to characterize prognostic lncRNAs with deregulated expression in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which has the worst prognosis. Extensive in silico analyses followed by in vitro experiments identified long intergenic non-coding RNA 261 (LINC00261) as a downregulated lncRNA in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which is generally associated with transforming growth factor \&beta; (TGF\&beta;) signaling in human cancer cells. Its genomic neighbor, the transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), regulated LINC00261 expression by direct binding of the LINC00261 promoter. CRISPR-mediated knockdown and promoter knockout validated the importance of LINC00261 in TGF\&beta;-mediated epithelial\&ndash;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and established the epithelial marker E-cadherin, an important cell adhesion protein, as a downstream target of LINC00261. Consequently, depletion of LINC00261 enhanced motility and invasiveness of PANC-1 cells in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that LINC00261 is an important tumor-suppressive lncRNA in PDAC that is involved in maintaining a pro-epithelial state associated with favorable disease outcome.},

Hydration is the key trigger to initiate germination, but the mechanism by which seeds sense water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates upon hydration and allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that biophysical states of FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo in suppressing seed germination under unfavorable environments. We find intragenic, intraspecific, and interspecific natural variation in FLOE1 expression and phase separation and show that intragenic variation is associated with adaptive germination strategies in natural populations. This combination of molecular, organismal, and ecological studies uncovers FLOE1 as a tunable environmental sensor with direct implications for the design of drought-resistant crops, in the face of climate change.},

 abstract = {The DNA methyltransferase DNMT3C appeared as a duplication of the DNMT3B gene in muroids and is required for silencing of young retrotransposons in the male germline. Using specialized assay systems, we investigate the flanking sequence preferences of DNMT3C and observe characteristic preferences for cytosine at the -2 and -1 flank that are unique among DNMT3 enzymes. We identify two amino acids in the catalytic domain of DNMT3C (C543 and V547) that are responsible for the DNMT3C-specific flanking sequence preferences and evolutionary conserved in muroids. Reanalysis of published data shows that DNMT3C flanking preferences are consistent with genome-wide methylation patterns in mouse ES cells only expressing DNMT3C. Strikingly, we show that CpG sites with the preferred flanking sequences of DNMT3C are enriched in murine retrotransposons that were previously identified as DNMT3C targets. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that DNMT3C has elevated methylation activity on substrates derived from these biological targets. Our data show that DNMT3C flanking sequence preferences match the sequences of young murine retrotransposons which facilitates their methylation. By this, our data provide mechanistic insights into the molecular co-evolution of repeat elements and (epi)genetic defense systems dedicated to maintain genomic stability in mammals.},

 abstract = {Migration is a widely observed phenomenon supported by morphological, physiological and behavioural traits that vary with season and sex in many species. Recently, the genetic components underpinning migration in the marmalade hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) have been unpacked through detection of differentially expressed genes between migrant and non-migrant females. Males also migrate, but changing sex ratios during autumn migration, from around 50\% female in northern Europe to around 90\% in southern Europe, suggests males are poor long-distance fliers. To elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this sex difference, we performed morphological, physiological and transcriptomic characterization of actively migrating females and males. Both sexes show similar physiological adaptations including hyperphagia and starvation resistance, but females display higher tolerance to cold, have lower wing loading values and display a greater flight capacity. In addition, females modulate the expression of genes involved in immunity, hypoxia and longevity while suppressing hormonal pathways involved in maintaining reproductive diapause. These traits contribute to the success of female migrants and underlie the diminishing pool of males, influencing population dynamics across huge geographic areas and through the whole migratory and overwintering period.},

 abstract = {Biodiversity and its associated genetic diversity are being lost at an unprecedented rate. Simultaneously, the distributions of flora, fauna, fungi, microbes and pathogens are rapidly changing. Novel ways to capture and record genetic diversity before it is lost, and to measure population shifts and pathogen distributions are urgently required. Here we report the rapid application of shotgun long-read environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for non-invasive biodiversity, genetic diversity and pathogen assessments from air. We also compared air eDNA with water and soil eDNA. Coupling long-read sequencing with established cloud-based biodiversity pipelines enabled a two-day turnaround from airborne sample collection to completed analysis, by a single investigator. To determine the full utility of airborne eDNA, we also conducted a local bioinformatic analysis and deep short-read shotgun sequencing. From outdoor air eDNA alone, comprehensive genetic analysis was performed including population genetics (phylogenetic placement) of a charismatic mammal (bobcat, Lynx rufus), and a venomous spider (golden silk orb weaver, Trichonephila clavipes), and haplotyping humans (Homo sapiens), from natural complex community settings, such as sub-tropical forests and temperate locations. The rich datasets also enabled deeper analysis of specific species and genomic regions of interest, including viral variant calling, human variant analysis, and antimicrobial resistance gene surveillance from airborne DNA. Our results highlight the speed, versatility, and specificity of pan-biodiversity monitoring via non-invasive eDNA sampling using current benchtop/portable and cloud-based approaches. Furthermore, they reveal the future feasibility of scaling down (equipment and temporally) these approaches for near real-time analysis. Together these approaches can enable rapid lifeform and genetic diversity detection from air, water, and sediment samples for unbiased non-targeted information-rich genomics-empowered i) biodiversity monitoring, ii) population genetics, iii) pathogen and disease vector genomic surveillance, iv) allergen and narcotic surveillance, v) antimicrobial resistance surveillance and vi) bioprospecting.},

The AML1/ETO (RUNX1/MTG8) fusion protein, caused by the translocation (8;21)(q22;q22), leads to the epigenetic repression of its target genes. We aimed in this work to identify critical epigenetic modifiers, on which AML1/ETO-positive AML cells depend on for proliferation and survival using shRNA library screens and global transcriptomics approaches. Using shRNA library screens, we identified 41 commonly depleted genes in two AML1/ETO-positive cell lines Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1. We validated, genetically and pharmacologically, DNMT1 and ATR using several AML1/ETO-positive and negative cell lines. We also demonstrated in vivo differentiation of myeloblasts after treatment with the DNMT1 inhibitor decitabine in a patient with an AML1/ETO-positive AML. Bioinformatic analysis of global transcriptomics after AML1/ETO induction in 9/14/18-U937 cells identified 973 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Three genes (PARP2, PRKCD, and SMARCA4) were both downregulated after AML1/ETO induction, and identified in shRNA screens. In conclusion, using unbiased shRNA library screens and global transcriptomics, we have identified several driver epigenetic regulators for proliferation in AML1/ETO-positive AML. DNMT1 and ATR were validated and are susceptible to pharmacological inhibition by small molecules showing promising preclinical and clinical efficacy.},

 abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is a powerful source of innovations in prokaryotes that can affect almost any cellular system, including microbial organelles. The formation of magnetosomes, one of the most sophisticated microbial mineral-containing organelles synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria for magnetic navigation in the environment, was also shown to be a horizontally transferrable trait. However, the mechanisms determining the fate of such genes in new hosts are not well understood, since non-adaptive gene acquisitions are typically rapidly lost and become unavailable for observation. This likely explains why gene clusters encoding magnetosome biosynthesis have never been observed in non-magnetotactic bacteria. Here, we report the first discovery of a horizontally inherited dormant gene clusters encoding biosynthesis of magnetosomes in a non-magnetotactic phototrophic bacterium Rhodovastum atsumiense. We show that these clusters were inactivated through transcriptional silencing and antisense RNA regulation, but retain functionality, as several genes were able to complement the orthologous deletions in a remotely related magnetotactic bacterium. The laboratory transfer of foreign magnetosome genes to R. atsumiense was found to endow the strain with magnetosome biosynthesis, but strong negative selection led to rapid loss of this trait upon subcultivation, highlighting the trait instability in this organism. Our results provide insight into the horizontal dissemination of gene clusters encoding complex prokaryotic organelles and illuminate the potential mechanisms of their genomic preservation in a dormant state.},

 abstract = {Molecular mechanisms which underpin compound leaf development in some legumes have been reported, but there is no previous study on the molecular genetic control of compound leaf formation in Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), an important dryland legume of African origin. In most studied species with compound leaves, class 1 KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX genes expressed in developing leaf primordia sustain morphogenetic activity, allowing leaf dissection and the development of leaflets. Other genes, such as, SINGLE LEAFLET1 in Medicago truncatula and Trifoliate in Solanum lycopersicum, are also implicated in regulating compound leaf patterning. To set the pace for an in-depth understanding of the genetics of compound leaf development in cowpea, we applied RNA-seq and whole genome shotgun sequence datasets of a spontaneous cowpea unifoliate mutant and its trifoliate wild-type cultivar to conduct comparative reference-based gene expression, de novo genome-wide isoform switch, and genome variant analyses between the two genotypes. Our results suggest that genomic variants upstream of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and down-stream of REVEILLE4, BRASSINOSTERIOD INSENSITIVE1 and LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES result in down-regulation of key components of cowpea circadian rhythm central oscillator and brassinosteroid signaling, resulting in unifoliate leaves and brassinosteroid-deficient-like phenotypes. We have stated hypotheses that will guide follow-up studies expected to provide more insights.},

@article{eggenhofer_cmv_2018,
 abstract = {SummaryA standard method for the identification of novel RNAs or proteins is homology search via probabilistic models. One approach relies on the definition of families, which can be encoded as covariance models (CMs) or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). While being powerful tools, their complexity makes it tedious to investigate them in their (default) tabulated form. This specifically applies to the interpretation of comparisons between multiple models as in family clans. The Covariance model visualization tools (CMV) visualize CMs or HMMs to: I) Obtain an easily interpretable representation of HMMs and CMs; II) Put them in context with the structural sequence alignments they have been created from; III) Investigate results of model comparisons and highlight regions of interest.AvailabilitySource code (http://www.github.com/eggzilla/cmv), web-service (http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CMVS) Contactegg@informatik.uni-freiburg.de, choener@bioinf.uni-leipzig.deSupplementary informationSupplementary data available online.},

 abstract = {The hepatic acute-phase response is characterized by a massive upregulation of serum proteins, such as haptoglobin and serum amyloid A, at the expense of liver homeostatic functions. Although the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) has a well-established role in safeguarding liver function and its cistrome spans around 50\% of liver-specific genes, its role in the acute-phase response has received little attention so far. We demonstrate that HNF4A binds to and represses acute-phase genes under basal conditions. The reprogramming of hepatic transcription during inflammation necessitates loss of HNF4A function to allow expression of acute-phase genes while liver homeostatic genes are repressed. In a pre-clinical liver organoid model overexpression of HNF4A maintained liver functionality in spite of inflammation-induced cell damage. Conversely, HNF4A overexpression potently impaired the acute-phase response by retaining chromatin at regulatory regions of acute-phase genes inaccessible to transcription. Taken together, our data extend the understanding of dual HNF4A action as transcriptional activator and repressor, establishing HNF4A as gatekeeper for the hepatic acute-phase response.},

@article{eisenhardt_genotyping_2022,
 abstract = {Background: Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a malignant soft tissue tumor of mesenchymal origin that frequently occurs in young adults. Translocation of the SYT gene on chromosome 18 to the SSX genes on chromosome X leads to the formation of oncogenic fusion genes, which lead to initiation and proliferation of tumor cells. The detection and quantification of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can serve as a non-invasive method for diagnostics of local or distant tumor recurrence, which could improve survival rates due to early detection. Methods: We developed a subtype-specific targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach specifically targeting SS t(X;18)(p11;q11), which fuses SS18 (SYT) in chromosome 18 to SSX1 or SSX2 in chromosome x, and recurrent point mutations. In addition, patient-specific panels were designed from tumor exome sequencing. Both approaches were used to quantify ctDNA in patients’ plasma. Results: The subtype-specific assay allowed detection of somatic mutations from 25/25 tumors with a mean of 1.68 targetable mutations. The minimal limit of detection was determined at a variant allele frequency of 0.05\%. Analysis of 29 plasma samples from 15 tumor patients identified breakpoint ctDNA in 6 patients (sensitivity: 40\%, specificity 100\%). The addition of more mutations further increased assay sensitivity. Quantification of ctDNA in plasma samples (n = 11) from one patient collected over 3 years, with a patient-specific panel based on tumor exome sequencing, correlated with the clinical course, response to treatment and tumor volume. Conclusions: Targeted NGS allows for highly sensitive tumor profiling and non-invasive detection of ctDNA in SS patients, enabling non-invasive monitoring of tumor dynamics.},

@article{el-sawalhi_epidemiological_2023,
 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide public health concern and has been associated with reports of elevated mortality. According to the One Health concept, antibiotic resistance genes are transferrable to organisms, and organisms are shared among humans, animals, and the environment. Consequently, aquatic environments are a possible reservoir of bacteria harboring antibiotic resistance genes. In our study, we screened water and wastewater samples for antibiotic resistance genes by culturing samples on different types of agar media. Then, we performed real-time PCR to detect the presence of genes conferring resistance to beta lactams and colistin, followed by standard PCR and gene sequencing for verification. We mainly isolated Enterobacteriaceae from all samples. In water samples, 36 Gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated and identified. We found three extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria—Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae strains—harboring the CTX-M and TEM groups. In wastewater samples, we isolated 114 Gram-negative bacterial strains, mainly E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus mirabilis strains. Forty-two bacterial strains were ESBL-producing bacteria, and they harbored at least one gene belonging to the CTX-M, SHV, and TEM groups. We also detected carbapenem-resistant genes, including NDM, KPC, and OXA-48, in four isolates of E. coli. This short epidemiological study allowed us to identify new antibiotic resistance genes present in bacterial strains isolated from water in Marseille. This type of surveillance shows the importance of tracking bacterial resistance in aquatic environments.
IMPORTANCE Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are involved in serious infections in humans. The dissemination of these bacteria in water, which is in close contact with human activities, is a serious problem, especially under the concept of One Health. This study was done to survey and localize the circulation of bacterial strains, along with their antibiotic resistance genes, in the aquatic environment in Marseille, France. The importance of this study is to monitor the frequency of these circulating bacteria by creating and surveying water treatments.},

 abstract = {Enhanced rock weathering (EW) is an emerging atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy being scaled up by the commercial sector. Here, we combine multiomics analyses of belowground microbiomes, laboratory-based dissolution studies, and incubation investigations of soils from field EW trials to build the case for manipulating iron chelators in soil to increase EW efficiency and lower costs. Microbial siderophores are high-affinity, highly selective iron (Fe) chelators that enhance the uptake of Fe from soil minerals into cells. Applying RNA-seq metatranscriptomics and shotgun metagenomics to soils and basalt grains from EW field trials revealed that microbial communities on basalt grains significantly upregulate siderophore biosynthesis gene expression relative to microbiomes of the surrounding soil. Separate in vitro laboratory incubation studies showed that micromolar solutions of siderophores and high-affinity synthetic chelator (ethylenediamine-N,N′-bis-2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, EDDHA) accelerate EW to increase CDR rates. Building on these findings, we develop a potential biotechnology pathway for accelerating EW using the synthetic Fe-chelator EDDHA that is commonly used in agronomy to alleviate the Fe deficiency in high pH soils. Incubation of EW field trial soils with potassium-EDDHA solutions increased potential CDR rates by up to 2.5-fold by promoting the abiotic dissolution of basalt and upregulating microbial siderophore production to further accelerate weathering reactions. Moreover, EDDHA may alleviate potential Fe limitation of crops due to rising soil pH with EW over time. Initial cost-benefit analysis suggests potassium-EDDHA could lower EW-CDR costs by up to U.S. \$77 t CO2 ha–1 to improve EW’s competitiveness relative to other CDR strategies.},

A total of 204 Palestinian type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients (mean age ± SD: 62.7±10.2) were enrolled in the present study (n=96 with dyslipidemia and n=108 without dyslipidemia). Next generation sequencing was performed to analyze five single nucleotide polymorphisms: Two variants rs7412 and rs429358 that determine {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} ε alleles, and three variants in the promoter region (rs769446, rs449647, and rs405509). For all subjects, the most common genotype was ε3/ε3 (79.4\%). No statistical differences were observed in the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} ε polymorphisms and the three promoter variants among T2D patients with and without dyslipidemia (P\&gt;0.05). A comparison of lipid parameters between ε3/ε3 subjects and ε4 carriers in both groups revealed no significant differences in the mean values of LDL‑C, HDL‑C, TG, and TC levels (P\&gt;0.05). Six CpG sites in the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} promoter on chromosome 19:44905755‑44906078 were identified, and differential DNA methylation in these CpGs were observed between the study groups.

Rbm3 protein shows conserved structural and molecular similarities to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which regulate all steps of the mRNA metabolism. Growing evidence is pointing towards a broader role of Rbm3 in various steps of gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that Rbm3 deficiency is linked to transcriptome-wide pre-mRNA splicing alterations, which can be reversed through Rbm3 co-expression from a cDNA. Using an MS2 tethering assay, we show that Rbm3 regulates splice site selection similar to other hnRNP proteins when recruited between two competing 5 ′ splice sites. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminal part of Rbm3 encompassing the RNA recognition motif (RRM), is sufficient to elicit changes in splice site selection.

 abstract = {The present investigation utilized in silico methodologies to explore the diverse pharmacological activities, toxicity profiles, and chemical reactivity of a series of fluoro-flavonoid compounds (1–14), which are secondary metabolites of plants known for their broad range of biological effects. A comprehensive strategy is utilized, incorporating methods such as prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS) prediction, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) assessments, and density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations using three basis sets: 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), and 6-311++G(d,p). Furthermore, the study employed molecular docking technique to identify target proteins, including HER2 (7JXH), EGFR (4UV7), FPPS (1YQ7), HPGDS (1V40), DCK (1P60), and KEAP1 on Nrf2 (1X2J), for the investigated compounds, with cianidanol and genistein serving as reference drugs for the docking process. The investigated fluoro-flavonoid compounds exhibited significantly greater binding affinities (ranging from −8.3 to −10.6 kcal mol−1) toward HER2, HPGDS, and KEAP1 compared to the reference drugs, cianidanol and genistein, which displayed binding affinities ranging from −8.4 to −9.4 kcal mol−1. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand interaction, using the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg) parameters and principle component analysis (PCA). Among the tested fluoro-flavonoid analogs, analog 11 showed a RMSD value of .15 nm with the HER2 protein target, indicating a stable interaction. Based on in silico results, it appears that the fluoro-flavonoid compound 11 has the potential to serve as a targeted anti-lung cancer drug. However, additional in vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.},

 abstract = {The aerial surfaces of plants harbour diverse communities of microorganisms. The rising awareness concerning the potential roles of these phyllosphere microbiota for airborne pollutant remediation and plant growth promotion, advocates for a better understanding of their community structure and dynamics in urban ecosystems. Here, we characterised the epiphytic microbial communities on leaves of Platanus x hispanica trees in the city centre of Hasselt (Belgium), and the nearby forest area of Bokrijk, Genk (Belgium). We compared the influences of season, site, and air pollutants concentration variations on the tree’s phyllosphere microbiome by determining the intra- and inter-individual variation in leaf bacterial communities. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed large variation in the bacterial community structure and diversity throughout the years but also allowed to discriminate an environment effect on community assembly. Partial drivers for this environment effect on composition can be correlated with the huge differences in ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) and black carbon on the leaves. A change in bacterial community composition was noted for trees growing in the city centre compared to the natural site, and also more human-associated genera were found colonising the leaves from the city centre. These integrated results offer an original and first insight in the Platanus phyllomicrobiota, which can offer new opportunities to use phyllosphere microorganisms to enhance air pollution degradation.},

Owls also share some traits with diurnal raptors and other nocturnal birds, such as cryptic plumage patterns, reversed sexual size dimorphism, and acute vision and hearing. The genetic basis of some of these adaptations to a nocturnal predatory lifestyle has been studied by candidate gene approaches but rarely with genome-wide scans. Here, we used a genome-wide comparative analysis to test for selection in the early history of the owls. We estimated the substitution rates in the coding regions of 20 bird genomes, including 11 owls of which ﬁve were newly sequenced. Then, we tested for functional overrepresentation across the genes that showed signals of selection. In the ancestral branch of the owls, we found traces of positive selection in the evolution of genes functionally related to visual perception, especially to phototransduction, and to chromosome packaging. Several genes that have been previously linked to acoustic perception, circadian rhythm, and feather structure also showed signals of an accelerated evolution in the origin of the owls. We discuss the functions of the genes under positive selection and their putative association with the adaptation to the nocturnal predatory lifestyle of the owls.},

 abstract = {Mutations of cilia-associated molecules cause multiple developmental defects that are collectively termed ciliopathies. However, several ciliary proteins, involved in gating access to the cilium, also assume localizations at other cellular sites including the nucleus, where they participate in DNA damage responses to maintain tissue integrity. Molecular insight into how these molecules execute such diverse functions remains limited. A mass spectrometry screen for ANKS6-interacting proteins suggested an involvement of ANKS6 in RNA processing and/or binding. Comparing the RNA-binding properties of the known RNA-binding protein BICC1 with the three ankyrin-repeat proteins ANKS3, ANKS6 (NPHP16) and INVERSIN (NPHP2) confirmed that certain nephronophthisis (NPH) family members can interact with RNA molecules. We also observed that BICC1 and INVERSIN associate with stress granules in response to translational inhibition. Furthermore, BICC1 recruits ANKS3 and ANKS6 into TIA-1-positive stress granules after exposure to hippuristanol. Our findings uncover a novel function of NPH family members, and provide further evidence that NPH family members together with BICC1 are involved in stress responses to maintain tissue and organ integrity.},

@article{fabian-morales_identification_2024,
 abstract = {Background Retinal dystrophies (RDs) are the most common cause of inherited blindness worldwide and are caused by genetic defects in about 300 different genes. While targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been demonstrated to be a reliable and efficient method to identify RD disease-causing variants, it doesn't routinely identify pathogenic structural variant as copy number variations (CNVs). Targeted NGS-based CNV detection has become a crucial step for RDs molecular diagnosis, particularly in cases without identified causative single nucleotide or Indels variants. Herein, we report the exome sequencing (ES) data-based read-depth bioinformatic analysis in a group of 30 unrelated Mexican RD patients with a negative or inconclusive genetic result after ES. Methods CNV detection was performed using ExomeDepth software, an R package designed to detect CNVs using exome data. Bioinformatic validation of identified CNVs was conducted through a commercially available CNV caller. All identified candidate pathogenic CNVs were orthogonally verified through quantitative PCR assays. Results Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were identified in 6 out of 30 cases (20\%), and of them, a definitive molecular diagnosis was reached in 5 cases, for a final diagnostic rate of 17\%. CNV-carrying genes included CLN3 (2 cases), ABCA4 (novel deletion), EYS, and RPGRIP1. Conclusions Our results indicate that bioinformatic analysis of ES data is a reliable method for pathogenic CNV detection and that it should be incorporated in cases with a negative or inconclusive molecular result after ES.},

 abstract = {Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the most commonly used technique in explorative proteomic research. A variety of open-source tools for peptide-spectrum matching have become available. Most analyses of explorative MS data are performed using conventional settings, such as fully specific enzymatic constraints. Here we evaluated the impact of the fragment mass tolerance in combination with the enzymatic constraints on the performance of three search engines. Three open-source search engines (Myrimatch, X! Tandem, and MSGF+) were evaluated concerning the suitability in semi- and unspecific searches as well as the importance of accurate fragment mass spectra in non-specific peptide searches. We then performed a semispecific reanalysis of the published NCI-60 deep proteome data applying the most suited parameters. Semi- and unspecific LC-MS/MS data analyses particularly benefit from accurate fragment mass spectra while this effect is less pronounced for conventional, fully specific peptide-spectrum matching. Search speed differed notably between the three search engines for semi- and non-specific peptide-spectrum matching. Semispecific reanalysis of NCI-60 proteome data revealed hundreds of previously undescribed N-terminal peptides, including cases of proteolytic processing or likely alternative translation start sites, some of which were ubiquitously present in all cell lines of the reanalyzed panel. Highly accurate MS2 fragment data in combination with modern open-source search algorithms enable the confident identification of semispecific peptides from large proteomic datasets. The identification of previously undescribed N-terminal peptides in published studies highlights the potential of future reanalysis and data mining in proteomic datasets.},

We performed functional characterization of a promising candidate effector of M. perniciosa. The inoculation of rBASIDIN at 4 µmol L−1 in the mesophyll of leaflets of Solanum lycopersicum caused symptoms of shriveling within 6 h without the presence of necrosis. However, when sprayed on the plant at a concentration of 11 µmol L−1, it caused wilting symptoms only 2 h after application, followed by necrosis and cell death at 48 h. rBASIDIN applied to Theobroma cacao leaves at the same concentration caused milder symptoms. rBASIDIN caused hydrogen peroxide production in leaf tissue, damaging the leaf membrane and negatively affecting the photosynthetic rate of Solanum lycopersicum plants. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BASIDIN has orthologs in other phytopathogenic basidiomycetes. Analysis of the transcripts revealed that BASIDIN and its orthologs are expressed in different fungal species, suggesting that this protein is differentially regulated in these basidiomycetes. Therefore, the results of applying BASIDIN allow the inference that it is an effector of the fungus M. perniciosa, with a strong potential to interfere in the defense system of the host plant.},

 abstract = {Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger proteins (KZNFs) recognize and repress transposable elements (TEs); TEs are DNA elements that are capable of replicating themselves throughout our genomes with potentially harmful consequences. However, genes from this family of transcription factors have a much wider potential for genomic regulation. KZNFs have become integrated into gene-regulatory networks through the control of TEs that function as enhancers and gene promoters; some KZNFs also bind directly to gene promoters, suggesting an additional, more direct layer of KZNF co-option into gene-regulatory networks. Binding site analysis of ZNF519, ZNF441, and ZNF468 suggests the structural evolution of KZNFs to recognize TEs can result in coincidental binding to gene promoters independent of TE sequences. We show a higher rate of sequence turnover in gene promoter KZNF binding sites than neighboring regions, implying a selective pressure is being applied by the binding of a KZNF. Through CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic deletion of ZNF519, ZNF441, and ZNF468, we provide further evidence for genome-wide co-option of the KZNF-mediated gene-regulatory functions; KZNF knockout leads to changes in expression of KZNF-bound genes in neuronal lineages. Finally, we show that the opposite can be established upon KZNF overexpression, further strengthening the support for the role of KZNFs as bona-fide gene regulators. With no eminent role for ZNF519 in controlling its TE target, our study may provide a snapshot into the early stages of the completed co-option of a KZNF, showing the lasting, multilayered impact that retrovirus invasions and host response mechanisms can have upon the evolution of our genomes.},

 abstract = {The large family of KRAB zinc finger (KZNF) genes are transcription factors implicated in recognizing and repressing repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs) in our genome. Through successive waves of retrotransposition-mediated insertions, various classes of TEs have invaded mammalian genomes at multiple timepoints throughout evolution. Even though most of the TE classes in our genome lost the capability to retrotranspose millions of years ago, it remains elusive why the KZNFs that evolved to repress them are still retained in our genome. One hypothesis is that KZNFs become repurposed for other regulatory roles. Here, we find evidence that evolutionary changes in KZNFs provide them not only with the ability to repress TEs, but also to bind to gene promoters independent of TEs. Using KZNF binding site data in conjunction with gene expression values from the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that KZNFs have the ability to regulate gene expression in the human brain in a region-specific manner. Our analysis shows that the expression of KZNFs shows correlation with the expression of their target genes, suggesting that KZNFs have a direct influence on gene expression in the developing human brain. The extent of this regulation and the impact it has on primate brain evolution are still to be determined, but our results imply that KZNFs have become widely integrated into neuronal gene regulatory networks. Our analysis predicts that gene expression networks have been repeatedly innovated throughout primate evolution, continuously gaining new layers of gene regulation mediated by both TEs and KZNFs in our genome.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Crossroads between transposons and gene regulation’.},

 abstract = {Elusive aquatic wildlife, such as endangered sea turtles, are difficult to monitor and conserve. As novel molecular and genetic technologies develop, it is possible to adapt and optimize them for wildlife conservation. One such technology is environmental (e)DNA – the detection of DNA shed from organisms into their surrounding environments. We developed species-specific green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle probe-based qPCR assays, which can detect and quantify sea turtle eDNA in controlled (captive tank water and sand samples) and free ranging (oceanic water samples and nesting beach sand) settings. eDNA detection complemented traditional in-water sea turtle monitoring by enabling detection even when turtles were not visually observed. Furthermore, we report that high throughput shotgun sequencing of eDNA sand samples enabled sea turtle population genetic studies and pathogen monitoring, demonstrating that noninvasive eDNA techniques are viable and efficient alternatives to biological sampling (e.g., biopsies and blood draws). Genetic information was obtained from sand many hours after nesting events, without having to observe or interact with the target individual. This greatly reduces the sampling stress experienced by nesting mothers and emerging hatchlings, and avoids sacrificing viable eggs for genetic analysis. The detection of pathogens from sand indicates significant potential for increased wildlife disease monitoring capacity and viral variant surveillance. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of eDNA approaches to ultimately help understand and conserve threatened species such as sea turtles.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT


Reef-building corals depend on symbiosis with photosynthetic algae that reside within their cells. As important as this relationship is for maintaining healthy reefs, it is strikingly delicate. When ocean temperatures briefly exceed the average summer maximum, corals can bleach, losing their endosymbionts. Although the mechanisms governing bleaching are unknown, studies implicate uncoupling of coral and algal cell divisions at high temperatures. Still, little is known regarding the coordination of host and algal cell divisions. Control of nutrient exchange is one likely mechanism. Both nitrogen and phosphate are necessary for dividing cells, and although nitrogen enrichment is known to increase symbiont density in the host, the consequences of phosphate enrichment are poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of phosphate depletion on symbiont growth in culture and compared the physiology of phosphate-starved symbionts in culture to symbionts that were freshly isolated from a host. We found that available phosphate is as low in freshly isolated symbionts as it is in phosphate-starved cultures. Furthermore, RNAseq revealed that phosphate-limited and freshly isolated symbionts have similar patterns of gene expression for phosphate-dependent genes, most notably upregulation of phosphatases, which is consistent with phosphate recycling. Similarly, lipid profiling revealed a substantial decrease in phospholipid abundance in both phosphate-starved cultures and freshly isolated symbionts. These findings are important because they suggest that limited access to phosphate controls algal cell divisions within a host.


IMPORTANCE
The corals responsible for building tropical reefs are disappearing at an alarming rate as elevated sea temperatures cause them to bleach and lose the algal symbionts they rely on. Without these symbionts, corals are unable to harvest energy from sunlight and, therefore, struggle to thrive or even survive in the nutrient-poor waters of the tropics. To devise solutions to address the threat to coral reefs, it is necessary to understand the cellular events underpinning the bleaching process. One model for bleaching proposes that heat stress impairs algal photosynthesis and transfer of sugar to the host. Consequently, the host’s demands for nitrogen decrease, increasing nitrogen availability to the symbionts, which leads to an increase in algal proliferation that overwhelms the host. Our work suggests that phosphate may play a similar role to nitrogen in this feedback loop.

 abstract = {Abstract Invasion, metastasis and therapy resistance are the major cause of cancer-associated deaths, and the EMT-inducing transcription factor ZEB1 is a crucial stimulator of these processes. While work on ZEB1 has mainly focused on its role as a transcriptional repressor, it can also act as a transcriptional activator. To further understand these two modes of action, we performed a genome-wide ZEB1 binding study in triple-negative breast cancer cells. We identified ZEB1 as a novel interactor of the AP-1 factors FOSL1 and JUN and show that, together with the Hippo pathway effector YAP, they form a transactivation complex, predominantly activating tumour-promoting genes, thereby synergising with its function as a repressor of epithelial genes. High expression of ZEB1, YAP, FOSL1 and JUN marks the aggressive claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, indicating the translational relevance of our findings. Thus, our results link critical tumour-promoting transcription factors: ZEB1, AP-1 and Hippo pathway factors. Disturbing their molecular interaction may provide a promising treatment option for aggressive cancer types.},

 abstract = {In eukaryotes, members of transcription factor families often exhibit similar DNA binding properties in vitro, yet orchestrate paralog-specific gene regulatory networks in vivo. The serially homologous first (T1) and third (T3) thoracic legs of Drosophila, which are specified by the Hox proteins Scr and Ubx, respectively, offer a unique opportunity to address this paradox in vivo. Genome-wide analyses using epitope-tagged alleles of both Hox loci in the T1 and T3 leg imaginal discs, the precursors to the adult legs and ventral body regions, show that {\textasciitilde}8\% of Hox binding is paralog-specific. Binding specificity is mediated by interactions with distinct cofactors in different domains: the Hox cofactor Exd acts in the proximal domain and is necessary for Scr to bind many of its paralog-specific targets, while in the distal leg domain, the homeodomain protein Distal-less (Dll) enhances Scr binding to a different subset of loci. These findings reveal how Hox paralogs, and perhaps paralogs of other transcription factor families, orchestrate alternative downstream gene regulatory networks with the help of multiple, context-specific cofactors.},

@article{fernandes_alise_2023,
 abstract = {Alternative Splicing (AS) is a co-transcriptional mechanism that enables the eukaryote to extend its proteome even with a limited number of genes. The cellular machinery performs AS by combining alternative regions of the isoforms in both productive and non-productive transcripts. AS events can be predicted using RNASeq data. In plants, the most frequent event is the retention of introns (IR) that can have a regulatory effect, for example, inserting a premature stop codon (PTC) that leads to degradation of the transcript through the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. To study potential AS events in the biological process of coffee bean and tomato ripening, we conducted a DAS study using RNASeq data obtained for differential expression experiment and the referential coffee genome to identify differential AS (DAS). For this, we developed pipelines in Python to perform an automated curation of the 202 target genes that were identified with 241 DAS events by rMATS in the comparisons of early green fruits, intermediate yellow and final red ripening stage. We then carried out a manual curation of the 241 events enriched with the Interproscan5 annotation with further experimentally validating of Potassium channel AKT1 and Apyrase 7 genes under differential alternative expression during coffee grain ripening using conventional PCR and qPCR. Due to challenges identified during this analysis associated with the relationship of AS events and RNASeq data processing, we built an application of user- friendly APP to predict AS in RNASeq data. The application development is composed of three modules named GeneAPPScript, GeneAPPServer, GeneAPPExplorer. The GeneAPPScript module is a powerful wrapper that enables to perform a complete DAS analysis from obtaining network data to functional annotation of genes under DAS. This module can run on Debian distros, such as the Google Collaboratory (Colab) environment where it was developed. The GeneAPPServer module is a Flask backend that allows you to integrate outputs from different DAS analysis software that generate data in tabular outputs. Using GeneAPPExplorer, the user can generate dozens of graphs to graphically visualize important results implicit in technical tables exported by DAS analysis software. In addition, through the webapp, the researcher has access to tables enriched with functional and structural annotation data and event attributes. GeneAPP will contribute to the analysis of AS in several other works deposited in public databases where only differential expression at the gene level was analyzed, allowing further explanation when exploring the transcriptome at the isoform level.},

 abstract = {In skeletal muscle tissue, the basement membrane lining the sarcolemma coats and protects myofibers 
from contraction-induced damage. A key component of this specialized structure is the Laminin-211 
(LN211). Pathogenic mutations in the LAMA2 gene, which encodes the α2-chain of laminin-211, trigger 
a life-threatening and currently incurable disease, LAMA2-muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD). However, 
the classical gene therapy approaches are not feasible due to the size of the LAMA2 gene, which exceeds 
the packaging capacity of one of the most used viral vectors, the recombinant adeno-associated virus 
(rAAV). Instead of introducing the complete gene sequence into the cells, homology-directed repair 
(HDR) can theoretically correct the majority of pathogenic point mutations responsible for LAMA2-MD. 
Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we have established two C2C12 myoblast cell lines that carry point 
mutations in Lama2, which recapitulate the ones found in the dy2J/dy2J and dynmf417/dynmf417 mouse 
models for LAMA2-MD. Furthermore, the obtained single-cell clones were confirmed by nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) to be heterozygous for the intended mutations. The established cell lines 
were then characterized and had an impairment in myoblast differentiation and fusion into myotubes. 
The single-cell clone carrying the dynmf417 mutation was used to evaluate the reversion of the specific 
mutation with all-in-one rAAV vectors by HDR. The engineered vector encoded a smaller version of 
Cas9 from Neisseria meningitidis, Nme2Cas9, a single sgRNA and the HDR donor template. The rAAV 
production was also optimized and the AAV1 serotype was selected as the most suitable for the 
transduction of the C2C12 cells. The muscle-specific rAAV9:HDR system was not able to edit and 
revert the specific mutation in the Lama2 gene but gave critical insights into the best rAAV design 
strategies. This project will contribute to the development of a new therapeutic strategy targeting 
LAMA2-MD that will be preceded by the in vivo studies using the dy2J/dy2J mice.},

 abstract = {Infertility is linked to different functions of male gametes, one of which is 
caused by impaired motility due to anomalies in sperm flagella. Several genetic 
defects culminate in the loss of fertility when viewed from an evolutionary 
perspective, where sperm flagellar function is extremely conserved across all 
kingdoms. The model moss Physcomitrium patens has genes copies homologous to 
human that are related to the architecture of microtubules that enable sperm motility. 
The moss P. patens has been an important model system for studying issues of 
evolutionary and developmental biology, as well as being an excellent model for 
studies of cellular reprogramming, in addition to collaborating with studies of 
flagellated organisms from various domains of biodiversity. Although the genes 
involved in the process of organogenesis of the reproductive structures of mosses 
are still little explored, it is believed that these may be involved in the construction of 
the motility of the flagellum and other elements of the architecture of the tissues and 
organs involved in evolution. Based on this hypothesis, our objective is to identify the 
genes responsible for the differentiation of reproductive structures and how these 
can identify problems in the formation of Organs reproductive organs of mosses. To 
achieve the objectives, a differential gene expression analysis was carried out with 
the aid of data obtained in the RNA-Seq technique. The reads used were obtained 
from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database, on the 
Sequence Reads Archives (SRA) platform SRR19502729, SRR19502730, 
SRR19502731, SRR19502732, SRR19502733, SRR19502734, SRR4454535 and 
SRR9901085. The raw reads were filtered by size and quality (Phred-Score 28) and 
then analyzed for transcript counts and differential gene expression analysis (DEGs) 
using the Salmon tool. As a result, the genes Pp3c10\_9456v3.1, Pp3c17\_1640V3.1 
and Pp3c17\_13470V3.1 were identified as possible genes involved in the sexual 
differentiation between sexual organs of moss, where these genes are 
over-expressed when there is formation of antheridia and under-expressed when 
there is formation of antheridia. archegoniums. Through the analysis of gene function 
and ontology, it was observed that the Pp3c10\_9456v3.1 gene is responsible for the 
determination of symmetry, morphogenesis of the anatomical structure, assembly of 
cellular components and development of organs in P. patens, being an ideal target 
for tests of gene knockout to validate its role in the differentiation of reproductive 
organs in this plant.},

The YY1 dimer is shown to bind tandem repeats of a canonical recognition DNA sequence with high affinity, and analysis of human YY1 regulatory sites shows that many contain repeats of its recognition elements. YY1 dimerization may compete with partner protein interactions, making control by zinc ion concentration a previously unrecognized factor affecting YY1 gene regulation. Indeed, YY1 is known to be important in many pathogenic processes, including neoplasia, in which zinc ion concentrations are altered.

As adenoviruses are a large group of viruses, displaying many different tropisms, immune epitopes, and replication characteristics, the merits of translating these natural benefits into vector applications are apparent. This translation, however, proves difficult, since while research has investigated the application of these viruses, there are no universally applicable rules in vector design for non-classical adenovirus types. In this paper, we describe a generalized workflow that allows vectorization, rescue, and cloning of all adenoviral species to enable the rapid development of new vector variants. We show this using human and simian adenoviruses, further modifying a selection of them to investigate their gene transfer potential and build potential vector candidates for future applications.},

 abstract = {Inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) via designed peptides is an effective strategy to perturb their biological functions. The Elongin BC heterodimer (ELOB/C) binds to a BC-box motif and is essential for cancer cell growth. Here, we report a peptide that mimics the high-affinity BC-box of the PRC2-associated protein EPOP. This peptide tightly binds to the ELOB/C dimer (kD = 0.46 ± 0.02 nM) and blocks the association of ELOB/C with its interaction partners, both in vitro and in the cellular environment. Cancer cells treated with our peptide inhibitor showed decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and perturbed gene expression. Therefore, our work proposes that blocking the BC-box-binding pocket of ELOB/C is a feasible strategy to impair its function and inhibit cancer cell growth. Our peptide inhibitor promises novel mechanistic insights into the biological function of the ELOB/C dimer and offers a starting point for therapeutics linked to ELOB/C dysfunction.},

@article{flores_orozco_evaluation_2024,
 abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) has shown the potential to reduce the abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in animal manures. It stands as a promising option to reduce the risk of the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to livestock production and manure applications. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these changes still need to be fully understood. This multidisciplinary study aimed to utilize metagenomics to investigate the molecular and microbial mechanisms associated with the evolution of ARGs and MGEs during the anaerobic digestion (AD) of bovine dairy manure. The research focused on three main aspects: 1) examining the long-term effects of mesophilic (MAD) and thermophilic (TAD) anaerobic digestion on the entire set of ARGs (resistome) and MGEs (mobilome) in manure; 2) comparing the impact of alternative manure treatments, such as storage and solid-liquid separation, on resistomes and mobilomes; 3) identifying microbial groups potentially associated with ARGs and MGEs and microbial shifts potentially driving changes in resistomes and mobilomes. A meta-analysis conducted early in this research informed the primary focus of this research. Two anaerobic digesters operating at mesophilic (36 °C) and the other at thermophilic (55 °C) temperatures were set up, operated, monitored, and studied for 4 and 2 years, respectively. Metagenomics analyses were used to evaluate resistomes, mobilomes, and microbiomes in the mesophilic and thermophilic digesters operating under steady state and in the bovine manure used as substrate. The results indicated that MAD and TAD lowered ARG levels in fresh cattle manure by over 50\% and MGEs by over 65\%. Surprisingly, TAD did not outperform MAD at reducing ARGs and MGEs. Co-occurrence analysis indicated a strong association between microbial groups from the phyla Bacillota (e.g., Jeotgalicoccus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus), Actinomycetota (e.g., Brevibacterium, Rhodococcus), and Pseudomonadota (e.g., Acinetobacter, Comamonas) with these AMR elements. The decline in the abundance of aerobic and facultative anaerobes likely linked to hydrolytic functions was suggested as one of the main drivers of the changes in resistomes and mobilomes. The proximity of toxin-antitoxin systems and transposon structures to specific ARGs (e.g., Erm, tet, Ant(6)-la) was discovered, which could explain the persistence of such ARGs in digestates. The study of the effects of other manure treatments, such as aerobic storage in an open tank and solid-liquid separation, revealed that they are less efficient in reducing ARGs and MGEs from manures than AD. In this study, the high levels of ARGs and genes conferring resistance to heavy metals in a farm operating in an antibiotic-free environment suggested that other antimicrobials, such as foot bathing solutions, may be causing the indirect selection of ARGs. Overall, this research made several contributions to understanding AMR in the context of anaerobic digestion of animal manure that could be extrapolated to other manure treatments. These contributions not only bridge existing gaps in the literature but also pave the way for future research, providing valuable insights that can be used to inform the development of more effective strategies to mitigate the dissemination of AMR associated with manure management, application, and disposal.},

 abstract = {Background Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) derives spatial molecular distribution maps directly from clinical tissue specimens. This allows for spatial characterization of molecular compositions of different tissue types and tumor subtypes, which bears great potential for assisting pathologists with diagnostic decisions or personalized treatments. Unfortunately, progress in translational MSI is often hindered by insufficient quality control and lack of reproducible data analysis. Raw data and analysis scripts are rarely publicly shared. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Galaxy MSI tool set for the reproducible analysis of an urothelial carcinoma dataset.
Methods Tryptic peptides were imaged in a cohort of 39 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human urothelial cancer tissue cores with a MALDI-TOF/TOF device. The complete data analysis was performed in a fully transparent and reproducible manner on the European Galaxy Server. Annotations of tumor and stroma were performed by a pathologist and transferred to the MSI data to allow for supervised classifications of tumor vs. stroma tissue areas as well as for muscle-infiltrating and non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas. For putative peptide identifications, m/z features were matched to the MSiMass list.
Results Rigorous quality control in combination with careful pre-processing enabled reduction of m/z shifts and intensity batch effects. High classification accuracy was found for both, tumor vs. stroma and muscle-infiltrating vs. non-muscle invasive tumors. Some of the most discriminative m/z features for each condition could be assigned a putative identity: Stromal tissue was characterized by collagen type I peptides and tumor tissue by histone and heat shock protein beta-1 peptides.Intermediate filaments such as cytokeratins and vimentin were discriminative between the tumors with different muscle-infiltration status. To make the study fully reproducible and to advocate the criteria of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) research data, we share the raw data, spectra annotations as well as all Galaxy histories and workflows. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026459 and Galaxy results via https://github.com/foellmelanie/Bladder\_MSI\_Manuscript\_Galaxy\_links.
Conclusion Here, we show that translational MSI data analysis in a fully transparent and reproducible manner is possible and we would like to encourage the community to join our efforts.},

 abstract = {The Amazon, with its vast biodiversity, harbors a complex network of ecosystems interconnected by rivers such as the Negro and Solimões. This unique dynamic favors the emergence and diversification of microbial lineages, rendering the region a hotspot for the discovery of innovative biological solutions. Within this context, this thesis investigated the biotechnological potential of 36 bacteria isolated from Amazonian river sediments, focusing on applications in phytopathogen biocontrol and plant growth promotion. The bacterial isolates were evaluated in vitro against agriculturally significant phytopathogens, including Corynespora cassiicola, Colletotrichum siamense, Rhizoctonia solani, and Ralstonia solanacearum. This initial screening gave rise to two main chapters: the first investigates the biocontrol of R. solanacearum, while the second examines the genomic potential and agricultural applications of Alcaligenes nematophilus SOL 109. In Chapter 1, three isolates - Priestia aryabhattai RN 11, Streptomyces sp. RN 24, and Kitasatospora sp. SOL 195 - demonstrated remarkable efficacy against R. solanacearum, with in vitro inhibition of 87-100\%, reduction of disease incidence by 40-90\% in tomato seedlings, and promotion of plant growth. Phylogenomic analyses based on ANI and dDDH revealed that RN 11 belongs to the species Priestia aryabhattai (ANI: 98.61\%, dDDH: 88.3\%), while RN 24 and SOL 195 presented values below the cut-off points for new species, potentially representing novel species within the genera Streptomyces and Kitasatospora, respectively. Chapter 2 elucidates the multifaceted potential of A. nematophilus SOL 109, demonstrating in vitro inhibition ranging from 74 to 93\% against phytopathogenic fungi. Under greenhouse conditions, evaluations indicate that the SOL 109 effectively controlled the pathogen R. solani and promoted growth in tomato plants. Genomic and chemical analyses of SOL 109 identified unique and shared biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within the genus Alcaligenes, genes conferring resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals, and metabolites with antimicrobial properties. The results of this thesis highlight the unexplored potential of Amazonian aquatic microorganisms, revealing new actinobacterial species (RN 24 and SOL 195) and reporting for the first time the occurrence of A. nematophilus in Brazil. This study significantly contributes to the development of sustainable plant disease management strategies, offers valuable insights into the secondary metabolism of the genus Alcaligenes, and opens new perspectives for biotechnological applications in agriculture, reinforcing the importance of conservation and study of Amazonian microbial biodiversity.},

 abstract = {With the current pace at which reference genomes are being produced, the availability of tools that can reliably and efficiently generate genome assembly summary statistics has become critical. Additionally, with the emergence of new algorithms and data types, tools that can improve the quality of existing assemblies through automated and manual curation are required.We sought to address both these needs by developing gfastats, as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) effort to generate high-quality reference genomes at scale. Gfastats is a standalone tool to compute assembly summary statistics and manipulate assembly sequences in FASTA, FASTQ or GFA [.gz] format. Gfastats stores assembly sequences internally in a GFA-like format. This feature allows gfastats to seamlessly convert FAST* to and from GFA [.gz] files. Gfastats can also build an assembly graph that can in turn be used to manipulate the underlying sequences following instructions provided by the user, while simultaneously generating key metrics for the new sequences.Gfastats is implemented in C++. Precompiled releases (Linux, MacOS, Windows) and commented source code for gfastats are available under MIT licence at https://github.com/vgl-hub/gfastats. Examples of how to run gfastats are provided in the GitHub. Gfastats is also available in Bioconda, in Galaxy (https://assembly.usegalaxy.eu) and as a MultiQC module (https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC). An automated test workflow is available to ensure consistency of software updates.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Key determinants of successful library preparation are the available amount of input DNA and the efficiency of the conversion of this DNA into functional library molecules. While the standard blunt-end ligation protocol for Ion Torrent libraries has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 25\%, Y-adapters enable highly efficient library preparation by (i) sticky-end ligation and (ii) rendering both DNA strands functional for sequencing, hence resulting in a theoretical efficiency of up to 100\%. Moreover, the generation of adapter dimers is reduced. Therefore, we designed, optimized and validated Y-adapters compatible with Ion Torrent sequencing. These facilitate higher library yields combined with overall high sequencing performance regarding the key characteristics read-length, base quality, and library complexity.},

@article{foschini_methylation_2020,
 abstract = {Background: Androgen Receptor (AR) has been described to play a prominent role in Male Breast Cancer (MBC). It maps on chromosome X, and recent reports indicate that X chromosome polysomy is frequent in MBC. Since the response to anti-androgen therapy may depend on AR polysomy and on its overexpression similarly to prostate cancer, aim of the present study was to investigate the DNA methylation level of AR and its coregulators, especially those mapped on the X chromosome, that may influence the activity of AR in MBC. Methods: The DNA methylation level of AR, MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC1, MAGEC2, FLNA, HDAC6, and UXT, mapped on the X chromosome, was evaluated by quantitative Bisulfite-NGS. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in a GalaxyProject environment using BWA-METH, MethylDackel, and Methylation Plotter tools. The study population consisted of MBC (41 cases) compared with gynecomastia (15 cases). Results: MAGEA family members, especially MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC, and UXT and HDAC6 showed hypomethylation of several CpGs, reaching statistical significance by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p{\textless}0.01) in MBC when compared to gynecomastia. AR showed almost no methylation at all. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that MAGEA family members mapped on X chromosome and coregulators of AR, are hypomethylated in male IDC. This may lead to their overexpression, enhancing AR activity, while AR itself shows very little methylation.},

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in raw and ready-to-eat food samples collected from two regions of Italy (Apulia and Basilicata) and to evaluate their resistance phenotypes and genetic characteristics. A total of 1000 food samples were screened, with a prevalence of 4.4\% of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The majority of the isolates belonged to Enterobacter spp. (60\%), followed by Moellerella wisconsensis, Atlantibacter hermannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli, among others. Genomic sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed high levels of resistance to β-lactams, with most isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). Notably, seven isolates harbored mcr genes (mcr-1, mcr-9, and mcr-10). Additionally, in four of them were predicted the IncHI2 plasmids, known to facilitate the spread of colistin resistance. Furthermore, 56 antimicrobial resistance genes were identified, suggesting the genetic mechanisms underlying resistance to several antibiotic classes. Virulence gene analysis showed that E. coli and other isolates carried genes linked to pathogenicity, increasing the potential risk to public health. This study emphasizes the role of food as a potential reservoir for colistin-resistant bacteria and the importance of monitoring the spread of AMR genes in foodborne pathogens.},

Here we define myeloid cellular states in gliomas by longitudinal single-cell profiling and demonstrate their strict control by the tumor genotype: in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant tumors, differentiation of infiltrating myeloid cells is blocked, resulting in an immature phenotype. In late-stage gliomas, monocyte-derived macrophages drive tolerogenic alignment of the microenvironment, thus preventing T cell response. We define the IDH-dependent tumor education of infiltrating macrophages to be causally related to a complex re-orchestration of tryptophan metabolism, resulting in activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. We further show that the altered metabolism of IDH-mutant gliomas maintains this axis in bystander cells and that pharmacological inhibition of tryptophan metabolism can reverse immunosuppression. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a glioma genotype-dependent intratumoral network of resident and recruited myeloid cells and identify tryptophan metabolism as a target for immunotherapy of IDH-mutant tumors.},

 abstract = {Background Physostegia chlorotic mottle virus (PhCMoV; genus: Alphanucleorhabdovirus, family: Rhabdoviridae) and tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV; genus: Tobamovirus, family: Virgaviridae) are newly emerging plant viruses that have a dramatic effect on tomato production. Among various known virus-control strategies, RNAi-mediated defence has shown the potential to protect plants against various pathogens including viral infections. Micro(mi)RNAs play a major role in RNAi-mediated defence. Methods Using in silico analyses, we investigated the possibility of tomato-encoded miRNAs (TomiRNA) to target PhCMoV and ToBRFV genomes using five different algorithms, i.e., miRanda, RNAhybrid, RNA22, Tapirhybrid and psRNATarget. Results The results revealed that 14 loci on PhCMoV and 10 loci on ToBRFV can be targeted by the TomiRNAs based on the prediction of at least three algorithms. Interestingly, one TomiRNA, miR6026, can target open reading frames from both viruses, i.e., the phosphoprotein encoding gene of PhCMoV, and the two replicase components of ToBRFV. There are currently no commercially available PhCMoV- or ToBRFV-resistant tomato varieties, therefore the predicted data provide useful information for the development of PhCMoV- and ToBFRV-resistant tomato plants.},

 abstract = {Objective
The study aimed to investigate the role of the PGN2012 gene of the periodontitis contributing pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis. PGN2012 is a homolgue of TolC and is a gene our group previously showed was overexpressed in hyperinvasive cells.
Methods
The study used a combination of bioinformatics, knockout mutagenesis, growth experiments, biofilm assays and human cell invation assays to investigate PGN2012 function.
Results
Bioinformatics identified that PGN2012 is part of one of four TolC containing gene loci in P. gingivalis that we predicted may encode a metal resistance RND family tripartite pump, similar to those present in other Gram-negative bacteria, but which are not well understood in anaerobic bacteria. A ΔPGN2012 deletion displayed slightly reduced growth in liquid culture but did not effect biofilm formation or human cell invasion. When metal ions were included in the medium the mutant displayed significantly increased sensitivity to the divalent metal ions Zn2+ (500 μM), Co2+ (2 mM), and Cd2+(0.1 mM) but not Cu2+.
Conclusions
We propose to rename the PGN2012-2014 genes czcCBA, which we suggest plays a role in intracellular stress resistance where zinc is often employed by host cells in antibacterial defence with implications for chronic infection in humans.},

Accordingly, based on the antimicrobial properties of Thyme Essential Oil (TEO), the present study evaluated the effects of TEO on the reduction of common microbial contaminants and Salmonella on poultry litter. A litter bulk sample was collected in a broiler farm and qualitative/quantitative investigations identified Escherichia coli and Mammaliicoccus lentus. The experimental contamination with Salmonella Derby wild strain was also performed. All pathogens showed phenotypic and genotypic resistance to different classes of antibiotics. The litter, split in different units, was treated with aqueous solutions of TEO at different concentrations (5\% to 1.25\%), demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the total number of bacteria. The strongest antibacterial action was observed at the lowest concentration against Enterobacteriaceae, with a growth reduction compared to the positive control of 73.3\% and 77.8\% against E. coli and Salmonella Derby, respectively, while towards M. lentus the reduction was 50\%. Our data confirm the antimicrobial activity of TEO and suggest its possible application for the treatment of poultry litter as an effective and natural approach for the prevention of diseases caused by the most common bacteria that colonize poultry farms, counteracting the onset of antibiotic resistance.},

@article{galia-camps_jumping_2024,
 abstract = {The systematics of the family Dendrodorididae, with only three valid genera, is a challenge for integrative taxonomists. Its members lack hard structures for morphological comparisons and their mitochondrial and nuclear markers provide contradictory phylogenetic signals, making phylogenetic reconstructions difficult. This molecular discordance has been hypothesized to be the result of nuclear pseudogenes or exogenous contamination. However, these hypotheses have not been tested. Here, we assembled the first genome drafts of seven Dendrodorididae species to investigate the evolutionary processes of this family. Two of the mitogenomes displayed an identical structural rearrangement involving the translocation of three coding genes and five tRNAs, described for the first time in nudibranchs. In addition, we found particularly high dN and dN/dS values and multiple insertions and deletions on the mitochondrial genes of smooth Dendrodoris. In contrast, nuclear single-copy ortholog genes showed no such mutational differences. Models of protein structures from mitochondrial genes are conserved, suggesting conserved functionality. Phylogenies using mitogenomic and nuclear data showed that species with rearranged mitogenomes form a clade, although Dendrodorididae relationships remained unresolved. The present study provides novel evidence for accelerated mutation rates in the mitogenomes of Dendrodorididae, which presumably have implications on respiratory adaptation, and highlights the importance of using genomic data to unveil rare evolutionary processes, crucial for correctly inferring phylogenies.},

 abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many diseases, such as cancer, are characterized by an alteration of cellular metabolism allowing cells to adapt to changes in the microenvironment. Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics and downstream data analyses are widely used techniques for unraveling cells' metabolic activity to understand the altered functioning of metabolic pathways in the diseased state. While a number of bioinformatic solutions exist for the differential analysis of Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics data, there is currently no available resource providing a comprehensive toolbox.
RESULTS: In this work, we present DIMet, a one-stop comprehensive tool for differential analysis of targeted tracer data. DIMet accepts metabolite total abundances, isotopologue contributions, and isotopic mean enrichment, and supports differential comparison (pairwise and multi-group), time-series analyses, and labeling profile comparison. Moreover, it integrates transcriptomics and targeted metabolomics data through network-based metabolograms. We illustrate the use of DIMet in real SIRM datasets obtained from Glioblastoma P3 cell-line samples. DIMet is open-source, and is readily available for routine downstream analysis of isotope-labeled targeted metabolomics data, as it can be used both in the command line interface or as a complete toolkit in the public Galaxy Europe and Workfow4Metabolomics web platforms.
AVAILABILITY: DIMet is freely available at https://github.com/cbib/DIMet, and through https://usegalaxy.eu and https://workflow4metabolomics.usegalaxy.fr. All the datasets are available at Zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/10925786.

 abstract = {Stable-isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) is a powerful approach for characterizing metabolic states in cells and organisms. By incorporating isotopes, such as 13C, into substrates, researchers can trace reaction rates across specific metabolic pathways. Integrating metabolomics data with gene expression profiles further enriches the analysis, as we demonstrated in our prior study on glioblastoma metabolic symbiosis. However, the bioinformatics tools for analyzing tracer metabolomics data have been limited. In this protocol, we encourage the researchers to use SIRM and transcriptomics data and to perform the downstream analysis using our software tool DIMet. Indeed, DIMet is the first comprehensive tool designed for the differential analysis of tracer metabolomics data, alongside its integration with transcriptomics data. DIMet facilitates the analysis of stable-isotope labeling and metabolic abundances, offering a streamlined approach to infer metabolic changes without requiring complex flux analysis. Its pathway-based "metabologram" visualizations effectively integrate metabolomics and transcriptomics data, offering a versatile platform capable of analyzing corrected tracer datasets across diverse systems, organisms, and isotopes. We provide detailed steps for sample preparation and data analysis using DIMet through its intuitive, web-based Galaxy interface. To showcase DIMet's capabilities, we analyzed LDHA/B knockout glioblastoma cell lines compared to controls. Accessible to all researchers through Galaxy, DIMet is free, user-friendly, and open source, making it a valuable resource for advancing metabolic research.,

However, the related molecular basis remains undetermined. Through comprehensive structural, enzymology and cellular characterization of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, we here report a multi-layered substrate-recognition mechanism underpinning their divergent genomic methylation activities. A hydrogen bond in the catalytic loop of DNMT3B causes a lower CpG specificity than DNMT3A, while the interplay of target recognition domain and homodimeric interface fine-tunes the distinct target selection between the two enzymes, with Lysine 777 of DNMT3B acting as a unique sensor of the +1 flanking base. The divergent substrate preference between DNMT3A and DNMT3B provides an explanation for site-specific epigenomic alterations seen in ICF syndrome with DNMT3B mutations.

However, the impacts of different aspects of land use intensification on functional groups of soil microbes remain insufficiently elucidated in agroecosystems. This study investigated soil microbial groups and their functional potential in arable fields embedded in a gradient of land use intensity (LUI), integrating multiple agricultural practices in the Netherlands. The results reveal changes in soil bacterial and fungal functional groups along the LUI gradient, with a strong negative relationship between LUI and the diversity of many fungal functional groups. Changes in LUI also led to significant changes in the composition of both bacterial and fungal functional communities. Specifically, irrigation and pest control were identified as the primary practices influencing the community assembly of soil microbial functional groups. We further show that the connectivity between soil fungal functional groups decreased under higher LUI. In summary, our findings demonstrate that reducing land use intensity may have positive impacts on the functional potential of soil microbial communities, particularly for soil fungi. Sustainable management practices particularly related to irrigation and pest control may alleviate some of the observed adverse effects.},

The interplay of global and specific functions of these proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed nucleosome positioning, H3K27 acetylation, transcription, and gastrulation rates in zebrafish embryos lacking pluripotency factors Pou5f3 and Sox19b. We show that the bulk transcriptional onset does not require Sox19b and Pou5f3, but is sensitive to their balance. Pou5f3 docks H3K27ac on the enhancers of genes involved in gastrulation and ventral fate specification. Sox19b facilitates Pou5f3 access to one-third of these enhancers. The genes regulating mesendodermal and dorsal fates are primed for activation independently on Pou5f3 and Sox19b. Strikingly, the loss of either factor results in activation of silent enhancers; simultaneous loss of both leads to premature expression of differentiation genes. Our results uncover how independent activities of maternal Pou5f3 and Sox19b add up or antagonize to determine the early gene expression repertoire.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In flowering plants, male gametes are produced in anthers, being encased in pollen grains. Understanding the genetic regulation of meiosis key events such as chromosome recognition and pairing, synapsis and recombination, is needed to manipulate chromosome associations for breeding purposes, particularly in important cereal crops like wheat. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyse gene expression and to validate the results obtained by other transcriptomic analyses, like RNA-seq. Selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is essential to obtain reproducible and accurate expression data. In this work, twelve candidate reference genes were evaluated using the mainstream algorithms geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and ΔCt, then ranked from most to least suitable for normalization with RefFinder. Different sets of reference genes were recommended to normalize gene expression data in anther meiosis of bread and durum wheat, their corresponding genotypes in the absence of the Ph1 locus and for comparative studies among wheat genotypes.

@article{gener_full-coverage_2019,
 abstract = {Objective: To evaluate native RNA sequencing for sequencing HIV-1 viral genomes. Methods: Fifteen HIV-1 strains were processed with Direct RNA Sequencing (SQK-RNA002) library kits and sequenced on MinION Mk1B devices with RevD flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). Raw reads were converted to FASTQ, aligned to reference sequences, and assembled into contigs. Multi-sequence alignments of the contigs were generated and used for cladistics analysis. Results: We sequenced full-length HIV-1 from the transcriptional start site to 39 LTR (100\% virion genome) in 3 out of 15 isolates (89.6, NLAD8, AD17), achieving majority coverage (defined as \&gt; 50\%) in another 7 out of 15 isolates. Inspection of NLAD8 sequence alignments revealed splicing or deletion signatures. Despite the strong 3′ bias, read coverage was sufficient to evaluate single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions in 9 isolates, and to assemble HIV-1 genomes directly from viral RNA, achieving a maximum of 94\% assembly coverage for NLAD8. Phylogenetic relationships were maintained at the level of contigs, as well as individual reads. Conclusions: ONT native RNA sequencing performed as expected, covering full-length HIV-1 RNA without PCR or cDNA sequencing. Native single-molecule RNA sequencing supported previous models of HIV-1 replication, and samples exhibited strain-specific transcriptional signals. We propose Context Dependency Variant Classification to describe variants occurring in information-dense regions of HIV. These data provide a rich resource for emerging RNA modification detection schemes. Future work will expand HIV-1 transcript profiling to infection models and clinical samples.},

@article{genolet_identification_2020,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}X-chromosomal genes contribute to sex differences, in particular during early development, when both X chromosomes are active in females. Here, double X-dosage shifts female pluripotent cells towards the naive stem cell state by increasing pluripotency factor expression, inhibiting the differentiation-promoting MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and delaying differentiation. To identify the genetic basis of these sex differences, we have performed a series of CRISPR knockout screens in murine embryonic stem cells to comprehensively identify X-linked genes that cause the female pluripotency phenotype. We found multiple genes that act in concert, among which Klhl13 plays a central role. We show that this E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor protein promotes pluripotency factor expression, delays differentiation and represses MAPK target genes, and we identify putative substrates. We thus elucidate the mechanisms that drive sex-induced differences in pluripotent cells with implications for gender medicine in the context of induced pluripotent stem cell based therapies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, the detailed annotation of these mitogenomes as well as comparative analyses are carried out to explore the codon usage, gene composition, and phylogenetic relationship of subfamilies of family Thripidae. Moreover, the gene rearrangement of subfamily Panchaetothripinae of family Thripidae is also studied. Both the mitogenomes featured by 37 genes including 13 PCGs, 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs and with single putative control region with a positive AT-skew and negative GC-skew. trnS1 without DHU arm in both species, trnV without DHU arm in M. kempi, and trnE without TΨC loop in As. tumiceps. Further, codon based comparative analysis depicted the existence of natural selection pressure on all the PCGs in all the subfamilies of family Thripidae. The phylogenetic analyses, using the Bayesian inference (BI) and Maximum likelihood (ML) supported the monophyly of two suborders and family Phlaeothripidae. The family Thripidae is recovered as paraphyletic and subfamily Panchaetothripinae is in sister relationship with family Aeolothripidae and Stenurothripidae rather than the other subfamilies of family Thripidae. The gene order of the order Thysanoptera is highly rearranged, while few members of the subfamily Panchaetothripinae showed similar gene order to family Stenurothripidae. Therefore, this study suggests that the phylogenetic relationship between the subfamily Panchaetothripinae and other families is uncertain, necessitating a whole genome-based study to clarify the position of Panchaetothripinae within the suborder Terebrantia.},

 abstract = {Nonstop extension mutations, a.k.a. stop-lost or stop-loss mutations, convert a stop codon into a sense codon resulting in translation into the 3’ untranslated region until the next in-frame stop codon, thereby extending the C-terminus of a protein. In cancer, only nonstop mutations in SMAD4 have been functionally characterized, while the impact of other nonstop mutations remain unknown. Here, we exploit our pan-cancer NonStopDB dataset and test all 2335 C-terminal extensions arising from somatic nonstop mutations in cancer for their impact on protein expression. In a high-throughput screen, 56.1\% of the extensions effectively reduce protein abundance. Extensions of multiple tumor suppressor genes like PTEN, APC, B2M, CASP8, CDKN1B and MLH1 are effective and validated for their suppressive impact. Importantly, the effective extensions possess a higher hydrophobicity than the neutral extensions linking C-terminal hydrophobicity with protein destabilization. Analyzing the proteomes of eleven different species reveals conserved patterns of amino acid distribution in the C-terminal regions of all proteins compared to the proteomes like an enrichment of lysine and arginine and a depletion of glycine, leucine, valine and isoleucine across species and kingdoms. These evolutionary selection patterns are disrupted in the cancer-derived effective nonstop extensions.},

 abstract = {Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of a non-invasive sampling procedure based on 13-gene DNA methylation analysis in the follow-up of patients previously treated for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Methods: The study population included 49 consecutive patients treated for OSCC. Oral brushing sample collection was performed at two different times: before any cancer treatment in the tumor mass and during patient follow-up almost 6 months after OSCC treatment, within the regenerative area after OSCC resection. Each sample was considered positive or negative in relation to a predefined cut-off value. Results: Before any cancer treatment, 47/49 specimens exceeded the score and were considered as positive. Six months after OSCC resection, 16/49 specimens also had positive scores in the samples collected from the regenerative area. During the follow-up period, 7/49 patients developed locoregional relapse: 6/7 patients had a positive score in the regenerative area after OSCC resection. The presence of a positive score after oral cancer treatment was the most powerful variable related to the appearance of locoregional relapse. Conclusion: 13-gene DNA methylation analysis by oral brushing may have a clinical application as a prognostic non-invasive tool in the follow-up of patients surgically treated for OSCC.},

In this study, we analyzed a ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI)-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate obtained from a patient previously exposed to CAZ-AVI expressing a novel K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-3 variant. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using reference broth microdilution. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using Illumina and Nanopore Technologies. Short- and long-reads were combined with Unicycler. Assemblies were investigated for multilocus sequence typing (MLST), antimicrobial resistance genes, porins, and plasmids. Results: The K. pneumoniae isolate (KP\_RM\_1) was resistant to CAZ-AVI, expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, amikacin, ertapenem, and cefiderocol (FDC) but was susceptible to tigecycline, colistin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, meropenem–vaborbactam, and imipenem–relebactam. WGS revealed that the KP\_RM\_1 genome is composed of a single chromosome of 5 Mbp and five circular plasmids. Further analysis showed the presence of novel blaKPC-216 located on a 72 kb plasmid. KPC-216 differs from KPC-3 by a Lysin (K) insertion at position 168 (+K168). Conclusions: We report the identification of a new KPC-3 variant associated with CAZ-AVI resistance. The KPC variants associated with CAZ-AVI resistance should be determined to promptly inform clinicians and start the appropriate antimicrobial therapy.},

We observed layer-specific changes in the dendritic complexity and spine density of CA1 pyramidal cells. In addition, transcriptomic analysis highlighted significant changes in the expression of synapse-related genes across development. Finally, we were able to identify significant changes in the expression levels of latrophilin 2, a postsynaptic guidance molecule known for its role in the entorhinal-hippocampal connectivity. These findings were supported by changes in the synaptic proteomic content in CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare.

@article{gobel_myc_2023,
 abstract = {Group 3 medulloblastoma is one of the most aggressive types of childhood brain tumors. Roughly 30\% of cases carry genetic alterations in MYC, SMARCA4, or both genes combined. While overexpression of MYC has previously been shown to drive medulloblastoma formation in mice, the functional significance of SMARCA4 mutations and their suitability as a therapeutic target remain largely unclear. To address this issue, we combined overexpression of MYC with a loss of SMARCA4 in granule cell precursors. Both alterations did not increase proliferation of granule cell precursors in vitro. However, combined MYC overexpression and SMARCA4 loss successfully induced tumor formation in vivo after orthotopic transplantation in recipient mice. Resulting tumors displayed anaplastic histology and exclusively consisted of SMARCA4-negative cells although a mixture of recombined and non-recombined cells was injected. These observations provide first evidence for a tumor-promoting role of a SMARCA4 deficiency in the development of medulloblastoma. In comparing the transcriptome of tumors to the cells of origin and an established Sonic Hedgehog medulloblastoma model, we gathered first hints on deregulated gene expression that could be specifically involved in SMARCA4/MYC driven tumorigenesis. Finally, an integration of RNA sequencing and DNA methylation data of murine tumors with human samples revealed a high resemblance to human Group 3 medulloblastoma on the molecular level. Altogether, the development of SMARCA4-deficient medulloblastomas in mice paves the way to deciphering the role of frequently occurring SMARCA4 alterations in Group 3 medulloblastoma with the perspective to explore targeted therapeutic options.},

 abstract = {Bioinformatics is fundamental to biomedical sciences, but its mastery presents a steep learning curve for bench biologists and clinicians. Learning to code while analyzing data is difficult. The curve may be flattened by separating these two aspects and providing intermediate steps for budding bioinformaticians. Single-cell analysis is in great demand from biologists and biomedical scientists, as evidenced by the proliferation of training events, materials, and collaborative global efforts like the Human Cell Atlas. However, iterative analyses lacking reinstantiation, coupled with unstandardized pipelines, have made effective single-cell training a moving target.To address these challenges, we present a Multi-Interface Galaxy Hands-on Training Suite (MIGHTS) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, which offers parallel analytical methods using a graphical interface (buttons) or code. With clear, interoperable materials, MIGHTS facilitates smooth transitions between environments. Bridging the biologist–programmer gap, MIGHTS emphasizes interdisciplinary communication for effective learning at all levels. Real-world data analysis in MIGHTS promotes critical thinking and best practices, while FAIR data principles ensure validation of results. MIGHTS is freely available, hosted on the Galaxy Training Network, and leverages Galaxy interfaces for analyses in both settings.

 abstract = {Medulloblastomas (MBs) are malignant pediatric brain tumors that are molecularly and clinically heterogenous. The application of omics technologies—mainly studying nucleic acids—has significantly improved MB classification and stratification, but treatment options are still unsatisfactory. The proteome and their N-glycans hold the potential to discover clinically relevant phenotypes and targetable pathways. We compile a harmonized proteome dataset of 167 MBs and integrate findings with DNA methylome, transcriptome and N-glycome data. We show six proteome MB subtypes, that can be assigned to two main molecular programs: transcription/translation (pSHHt, pWNT and pG3myc), and synapses/immunological processes (pSHHs, pG3 and pG4). Multiomic analysis reveals different conservation levels of proteome features across MB subtypes at the DNA methylome level. Aggressive pGroup3myc MBs and favorable pWNT MBs are most similar in cluster hierarchies concerning overall proteome patterns but show different protein abundances of the vincristine resistance-associated multiprotein complex TriC/CCT and of N-glycan turnover-associated factors. The N-glycome reflects proteome subtypes and complex-bisecting N-glycans characterize pGroup3myc tumors. Our results shed light on targetable alterations in MB and set a foundation for potential immunotherapies targeting glycan structures.},

 abstract = {This work studied the performances of two ad hoc biochar-based cathode materials: one obtained from pyrolysis of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OW) and the other of wood chips (WC), in the context of three different bio-electrochemical reactors’ scope: MFC, MEC and MES. Cathodes were characterized through composition, pH, specific surface area and infrared spectroscopy; then production of electricity, methane (CH4), and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from carbon dioxide (CO2) was described, and finally the microbial community was explored through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. WC-based electrodes performed better than OW-based ones. WC (200 ± 25 mV) generated twice the amount of electricity compared to OW (100 ± 10 mV) in MFC modality. In MEC modality, WC achieved both higher CH4 production and concentration (3.6 ± 0.7 mL per day, 73.2 ± 3.9 \% v/v, respectively) than OW (3.0 ± 0.3 mL per day, 70 ± 8 \% v/v, respectively). In MES modality, WC produced ten times more acetic acid (0.3 ± 0.13 g L−1 per day) than OW (0.03 ± 0.04 g L−1 per day). The better performance of the WC-biochar cathode was attributed to its higher Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) value and its carbonaceous graphite-like structure. NGS analysis highlighted the presence of specific genera of microorganisms leading to the differential functioning of the systems.},

We hypothesized that the culturing procedure proliferates Hpa-associated microbiota (HAM) in addition to the pathogen and exploited this model system to investigate which microorganisms consistently associate with Hpa. Using amplicon sequencing, we found nine bacterial sequence variants that are shared between at least three out of four Hpa cultures in the Netherlands and Germany and comprise 34\% of the phyllosphere community of the infected plants. Whole-genome sequencing showed that representative HAM bacterial isolates from these distinct Hpa cultures are isogenic and that an additional seven published Hpa metagenomes contain numerous sequences of the HAM. Although we showed that HAM benefit from Hpa infection, HAM negatively affect Hpa spore formation. Moreover, we show that pathogen-infected plants can selectively recruit HAM to both their roots and shoots and form a soil-borne infection-associated microbiome that helps resist the pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms by which infection-associated microbiomes are formed might enable breeding of crop varieties that select for protective microbiomes.},

The human transcriptome encodes a wide variety of information and thus has received increasing interest for the identification of biomarkers for different aspects of forensic trace contextualization over the past years. Massively parallel sequencing of reverse-transcribed RNA (“RNA sequencing”) has emerged as the gold standard technology to characterize the transcriptome in its entirety and identify RNA markers showing significant expression differences not only between different forensically relevant body fluids but also within a single body fluid between forensically relevant conditions of interest. Here, we analyze the quality and composition of four RNA sequencing datasets (whole transcriptome as well as miRNA sequencing) from two different research projects (the RNAgE project and the TrACES project), aiming at identifying contextualizing forensic biomarker from the forensically relevant body fluid saliva. We describe and characterize challenges of RNA sequencing of saliva samples arising from the presence of oral bacteria, the heterogeneity of sample composition, and the confounding factor of degradation. Based on these observations, we formulate recommendations that might help to improve RNA biomarker discovery from the challenging but forensically relevant body fluid saliva.},

@article{goshi_direct_2025,
 abstract = {Cognitive impairment is one of the many symptoms reported by individuals suffering from long-COVID and other post-viral infection disorders such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A common factor among these conditions is a sustained immune response and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are two such cytokines that are elevated in patients diagnosed with long-COVID and ME/CFS. In this study, we characterized the changes in neural functionality, secreted cytokine profiles, and gene expression in co-cultures of human iPSC-derived neurons and primary astrocytes in response to prolonged exposure to TNF-α and IL-6. We found that exposure to TNF-α produced both a concentration-independent and concentration-dependent response in neural activity. Burst duration was significantly reduced within a few days of exposure regardless of concentration (1 pg/mL – 100 ng/mL) but returned to baseline after 7 days. Treatment with low concentrations of TNF-α (e.g., 1 and 25 pg/mL) did not lead to changes in the secreted cytokine profile or gene expression but still resulted in significant changes to electrophysiological features such as interspike interval and burst duration. Conversely, treatment with high concentrations of TNF-α (e.g., 10 and 100 ng/mL) led to reduced spiking activity, which may be correlated to changes in neural health, gene expression, and increases in inflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g., IL-1β, IL-4, and CXCL-10) that were observed at higher TNF-α concentrations. Prolonged exposure to IL-6 led to changes in bursting features, with significant reduction in the number of spikes in bursts across a wide range of treatment concentrations (i.e., 1 pg/mL–10 ng/mL). In combination, the addition of IL-6 appears to counteract the changes to neural function induced by low concentrations of TNF-α, while at high concentrations of TNF-α the addition of IL-6 had little to no effect. Conversely, the changes to electrophysiological features induced by IL-6 were lost when the cultures were co-stimulated with TNF-α regardless of the concentration, suggesting that TNF-α may play a more pronounced role in altering neural function. These results indicate that increased concentrations of key inflammatory cytokines associated with long-COVID can directly impact neural function and may be a component of the cognitive impairment associated with long-COVID and other post-viral infection disorders.},

 abstract = {Dysregulation of epigenetic processes is increasingly understood to play a role in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Ruxolitinib, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, has proved a useful addition to the therapeutic arsenal for these disorders, but has limited disease modifying activity. We determined the effect of JAK inhibition on the histone landscape of MPN cells in cell line models of MPNs and validated using samples from the MAJIC randomised clinical trial of ruxolitinib in polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia. We demonstrated an epigenetic modifying effect of ruxolitinib using a histone modification assay. The majority of 21 histone H3 modifications were upregulated, with H3K27me3 and H3K36me2 significant in the combined cell line results. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CHIP-seq) for three marks of interest, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, was consistent with the histone modification assay showing a significant increase in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks at promoter regions, both marks of active transcription. In contrast, RNA sequencing demonstrates a coordinated reduction in gene expression in a number of cell pathways including PI3K-AKT signalling, transcriptional misregulation in cancer and JAK-STAT signalling in spite of these histone changes. This highlights the complex mechanisms of transcriptional control within the cells which was reflected in analysis of the histone landscape in patient samples following ruxolitinib treatment.},

 abstract = {Increased production of Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is linked to development and progression of asthma and allergy. PGD2 is rapidly degraded to its metabolites, which initiate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) migration and IL-5/IL-13 cytokine secretion in a PGD2 receptor 2 (DP2)-dependent manner. Blockade of DP2 has shown therapeutic benefit in subsets of asthma patients. Cellular mechanisms of ILC2 activity in response to PGD2 and its metabolites are still unclear. We hypothesized that ILC2 respond non-uniformly to PGD2 metabolites. ILC2s were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with atopic asthma. ILC2s were stimulated with PGD2 and four PGD2 metabolites (Δ12-PGJ2, Δ12-PGD2, 15-deoxyΔ12,14-PGD2, 9α,11β-PGF2) with or without the selective DP2 antagonist fevipiprant. Total RNA was sequenced, and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified by DeSeq2. Differential gene expression analysis revealed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory DEGs in ILC2s stimulated with PGD2 (14 DEGs), Δ12-PGD2 (27 DEGs), 15-deoxyΔ12,14-PGD2 (56 DEGs) and Δ12-PGJ2 (136 DEGs), but not with 9α,11β-PGF2. Common upregulated DEGs were i.e. ARG2, SLC43A2, LAYN, IGFLR1, or EPHX2. Inhibition of DP2 via fevipiprant mainly resulted in downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as DUSP4, SPRED2, DUSP6, ETV1, ASB2, CD38, ADGRG1, DDIT4, TRPM2, or CD69. DEGs were related to migration and various immune response-relevant pathways such as “chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 production”, “cell migration”, “interleukin-13 production”, “regulation of receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT”, or “lymphocyte apoptotic process”, underlining the pro-inflammatory effects of PGD2 metabolite-induced immune responses in ILC2s as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of DP2 inhibition via fevipiprant. Furthermore, PGD2 and metabolites showed distinct profiles in ILC2 activation. Overall, these results expand our understanding of DP2 initiated ILC2 activity.},

 abstract = {Segmental instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by bronchoscopy safely induces transient airway inflammation in human lungs. This model enables investigation of pulmonary inflammatory mechanisms as well as pharmacodynamic analysis of investigational drugs. The aim of this work was to describe the transcriptomic profile of human segmental LPS challenge with contextualization to major respiratory diseases. Pre-challenge bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and biopsies were sampled from 28 smoking, healthy participants, followed by segmental instillation of LPS and saline as control. Twenty-four hours post instillation, BAL and biopsies were collected from challenged lung segments. Total RNA of cells from BAL and biopsy samples were sequenced and analysed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After challenge with LPS compared with saline, 6316 DEGs were upregulated and 241 were downregulated in BAL, but only one DEG was downregulated in biopsy samples. Upregulated DEGs in BAL were related to molecular functions such as “Inflammatory response” or “chemokine receptor activity”, and upregulated pro-inflammatory pathways such as “Wnt-"/“Ras-"/“JAK-STAT” “-signaling pathway”. Furthermore, the segmental LPS challenge model resembled aspects of the five most prevalent respiratory diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, tuberculosis and lung cancer and featured similarities with acute exacerbations in COPD (AECOPD) and community-acquired pneumonia. Overall, our study provides extensive information about the transcriptomic profile from BAL cells and mucosal biopsies following LPS challenge in healthy smokers. It expands the knowledge about the LPS challenge model providing potential overlap with respiratory diseases in general and infection-triggered respiratory insults such as AECOPD in particular.},

No comparable activity is observed with cytarabine, a cytidine analogue without DNA-hypomethylating properties. As evidence exists for compounding hypermethylation and gene silencing of hemizygous tumor suppressor genes (TSG), we thus hypothesized that this effect may preferentially be reversed by the HMAs decitabine and azacitidine. An unbiased RNA-sequencing approach was developed to interrogate decitabine-induced transcriptome changes in AML cell lines with or without a deletion of chromosomes 7q, 5q or 17p. HMA treatment preferentially upregulated several hemizygous TSG in this genomic region, significantly derepressing endogenous retrovirus (ERV)3–1, with promoter demethylation, enhanced chromatin accessibility, and increased H3K4me3 levels. Decitabine globally reactivated multiple transposable elements, with activation of the dsRNA sensor RIG-I and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7. Induction of ERV3–1 and RIG-I mRNA was also observed during decitabine treatment in vivo in serially sorted peripheral blood AML blasts. In patient-derived monosomal karyotype AML murine xenografts, decitabine treatment resulted in superior survival rates compared with cytarabine. Collectively, these data demonstrate preferential gene derepression and ERV reactivation in AML with chromosomal deletions, providing a mechanistic explanation that supports the clinical observation of superiority of HMA over cytarabine in this difficult-to-treat patient group.
Significance: These findings unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the intriguing clinical activity of HMAs in AML/MDS patients with chromosome 7 deletions and other monosomal karyotypes.See related commentary by O'Hagan et al., p. 813

Currently, the retrieval approaches are mainly based on text matching between natural language queries and the descriptions of candidate workflows. Notably, the workflow structure also provides essential semantics, but the challenge lies in effectively matching these two pieces of heterogeneous information. To address this issue, we propose a Proxy-based Scientific workflow retrieval approach, ProSwats, which selects a workflow as the Proxy for each text query to bridge the gap between textual and structural semantics. ProSwats consists of two stages: workflow pre-selection based on text similarity and workflow ranking based on a matching degree prediction model. The textual and structural features are integrated by the proxy in this model, which is used to predict and rank the degree of semantic matching between the user query and candidate workflows. Crucially, ProSwats incorporates a confidence-aware learning mechanism to adapt to the varying reliability of proxies, enhancing generalizability. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ProSwats outperforms state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance.},

Although popular fragment discovery strategies can identify frequent and similar fragments, they lack the ability to further mine pattern semantics. Moreover, current recommendation approaches are primarily based on text matching between natural language queries and the descriptions of candidate fragments, neglecting crucial structural information that conveys their functions. To address these challenges, this paper designs SWARM, a scientific workflow fragments recommendation approach via contrastive learning and semantic matching. SWARM consists of two phases: fragment discovery based on frequent subgraph mining and a contrastive semantics extraction model, and fragment recommendation based on a matching degree prediction model incorporating a pre-trained fragment encoder, which is used to predict and rank the degree of semantic matching between the user query and candidate fragments. SWARM aims to extract and integrate textual and structural semantics from fragments to discover and recommend them. The experimental results on commonly-used real-world datasets show that SWARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance.},

 abstract = {Finding scientific workflow models that can be reused or repurposed from public repositories is becoming popular in the scientific community. Currently, the retrieval approaches for workflow models are mainly based on text matching between queries and the descriptions of models. However, the structure information of these models, which includes inputs, outputs, data processing modules, and datalinks connecting modules, expresses their functions in a more detailed manner, yet this information is not used in the model retrieval process. Therefore, we propose a two-stage framework for Scientific WOrkflow Retrieval by learning Textual and Structural semantics (SWORTS). The framework comprises a workflow pre-selection step and a workflow ranking step. Specifically, we use text similarity approaches to quickly identify candidate workflow models in the first step. Then, a hierarchy-based matching degree prediction model, which takes both textual and structural features into account, is trained to predict and rank the degree of semantic matching between requirement specifications and candidate workflows. The experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that SWORTS achieves the best performance with relatively balanced effectiveness and efficiency among state-of-the-art methods.},

The outer surface of CPs and ILFs is demarcated by a poorly characterized population of CD11c+ cells. Using genome-wide single-cell transcriptional profiling of intestinal mononuclear phagocytes and multidimensional flow cytometry, we found that CP- and ILF-associated CD11c+ cells were a transcriptionally distinct subset of intestinal cDCs, which we term CIA-DCs. CIA-DCs required programming by CP- and ILF-resident CCR6+ ILC3 via lymphotoxin-β receptor signaling in cDCs. CIA-DCs differentially expressed genes associated with immunoregulation and were the major cellular source of IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) at steady state. Mice lacking CIA-DC-derived IL-22BP exhibited diminished expression of epithelial lipid transporters, reduced lipid resorption, and changes in body fat homeostasis. Our findings provide insight into the design principles of an immunoregulatory checkpoint controlling nutrient absorption.},

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is considered as a host of choice for cloning and engineering whole or partial genomes from viruses, bacteria, and algae. Several methods are now available to perform these manipulations, each with its own limitations. In order to extend the range of yeast cloning strategies, a new approach combining two already described methods, Fusion cloning and CReasPy-Cloning, was developed. The CReasPy-Fusion method allows the simultaneous cloning and engineering of megabase-sized genomes in yeast by the fusion of bacterial cells with yeast spheroplasts carrying the CRISPR-Cas9 system. With this new approach, we demonstrate the feasibility of cloning and editing whole genomes from several Mycoplasma species belonging to different phylogenetic groups. We also show that CReasPy-Fusion allows the capture of large genome fragments with high efficacy, resulting in the successful cloning of selected loci in yeast. We finally identify bacterial nuclease encoding genes as barriers for CReasPy-Fusion by showing that their removal from the donor genome improves the cloning efficacy.},

This unique investigation yielded the unprecedented presence of T. halophilus in human feces samples, thus enriching the repertoire of halophilic microorganisms colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract with the isolation and culture of T. halophilus for the first time in humans. Using the E-test strips, the MIC was assessed for T. halophilus strain CSURQ6002: rifampicin (MIC at 0.002 μg/mL), benzylpenicillin (MIC at 0.094 μg/mL), amoxicillin (MIC at 0.5 μg/mL), erythromycin (MIC at 2 μg/mL), clindamycin (MIC at 4 μg/mL), and vancomycin (MIC at 8 μg/mL). However, this strain showed a MIC up to 256 μg/mL for ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, doxycyclin, imipenem, and colistin. In-silico profiling derived from whole genome sequencing (NCBI accession number: PRJNA780809), was confirmed.

 abstract = {Heptageniidae are known for their flat heads and bodies and are divided into three subfamilies. Despite the extensive diversity within this group and considerable efforts made to understand their evolutionary history, the internal classifications and origin time of Heptageniidae remains controversial. In this study, we newly sequenced 17 complete mitogenomes of Heptageniidae to reconstruct their phylogenetic positions within this family. Because of the ambiguous time of origin, our study also estimated the divergence time within Heptageniidae based on five fossil calibration points. The results of BI and ML trees all highly supported the monophyly of Heptageniidae and three subfamilies. The phylogenetic relationship of Rhithrogeninae + (Ecdyonurinae + Heptageniinae) was also recovered. The divergence time showed that Heptageniidae originated from 164.38 Mya (95\% HPD, 150.23–181.53 Mya) in the mid-Jurassic, and Rhithrogeninae originated from 95.54 Mya (95\% HPD, 73.86–120.19 Mya) in the mid-Cretaceous. Ecdyonurinae and Heptageniinae began to diverge at 90.08 Mya (95\% HPD, 68.81–113.16 Mya) in the middle Cretaceous. After morphological identification, analysis of the mitogenome’s composition, genetic distance calculation, phylogenetic analysis, and divergence time calculation, we suggest that two different populations of Epeorus montanus collected from Aksu, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (40°16′ N, 80°26′ E) and Xinyuan, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (43°20′ N, 83°43′ E) in China are cryptic species of E. montanus, but further detailed information on their morphological characteristics is needed to fully identify them.},

 abstract = {Streptococcussuis is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe invasive disease in pigs and humans. Current methods for genome engineering of S. suis rely on the insertion of antibiotic resistance markers, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive and does not allow the precise introduction of small genomic mutations. Here we developed a system for CRISPR-based genome editing in S. suis, utilizing linear DNA fragments for homologous recombination (HR) and a plasmid-based negative selection system for bacteria not edited by HR. To enable the use of this system in other bacteria, we engineered a broad-host-range replicon in the CRISPR plasmid. We demonstrated the utility of this system to rapidly introduce multiple gene deletions in successive rounds of genome editing and to make precise nucleotide changes in essential genes. Furthermore, we characterized a mechanism by which S. suis can escape killing by a targeted Cas9-sgRNA complex in the absence of HR. A characteristic of this new mechanism is the presence of very slow-growing colonies in a persister-like state that may allow for DNA repair or the introduction of mutations, alleviating Cas9 pressure. This does not impact the utility of CRISPR-based genome editing because the escape colonies are easily distinguished from genetically edited clones due to their small colony size. Our CRISPR-based editing system is a valuable addition to the genetic toolbox for engineering of S. suis, as it accelerates the process of mutant construction and simplifies the removal of antibiotic markers between successive rounds of genome editing.},

Impaired regeneration and remodeling of mucociliary epithelia are associated with dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in chronic airway diseases, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and studies yield seemingly contradicting results. Employing the Xenopus mucociliary epidermis, the mouse airway, and human airway Basal cells, we characterize the evolutionarily conserved roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vertebrates. In multiciliated cells, Wnt is required for cilia formation during differentiation. In Basal cells, Wnt prevents specification of epithelial cell types by activating ΔN-TP63, a master transcription factor, which is necessary and sufficient to mediate the Wnt-induced inhibition of specification and is required to retain Basal cells during development. Chronic Wnt activation leads to remodeling and Basal cell hyperplasia, which are reversible in vivo and in vitro, suggesting Wnt inhibition as a treatment option in chronic lung diseases. Our work provides important insights into mucociliary signaling, development, and disease.},

 abstract = {Increased life expectancy in modern society comes at the cost of age-associated disabilities and diseases. Aged brains not only show reduced excitability and plasticity, but also a decline in inhibition. Age-associated defects in inhibitory circuits likely contribute to cognitive decline and age-related disorders. Molecular mechanisms that exert epigenetic control of gene expression contribute to age-associated neuronal impairments. Both DNA methylation, mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and histone modifications maintain neuronal function throughout lifespan. Here we provide evidence that DNMT1 function is implicated in the age-related loss of cortical inhibitory interneurons. Dnmt1 deletion in parvalbumin-positive interneurons attenuates their age-related decline in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, DNMT1-deficient mice show improved somatomotor performance and reduced aging-associated transcriptional changes. A decline in the proteostasis network, responsible for the proper degradation and removal of defective proteins, is implicated in age- and disease- related neurodegeneration. Our data suggest that DNMT1 acts indirectly on interneuron survival in aged mice by modulating the proteostasis network during life-time.},

 abstract = {The aims of the study were to characterise the distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. and subtypes causing infections in Finland during 2021. This was carried out with 60 clinical samples from the hospital districts of Helsinki and Uusimaa, Vaasa, Kymenlaakso, South Karelia, and Central Finland, as well as with Finnish Infectious Diseases Register (FIDR) data. Additionally, the study aimed to explore the potential exposures related to Cryptosporidium mortiferum (Cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype I) infections via interview. Species identification was carried out with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and 18S sequencing. Further typing was performed with gp60 subtyping. Over 70\% of the samples were identified as Cryptosporidium parvum and 20\% as C. mortiferum, which had not been identified in Finland before. Two cases of Cryptosporidium hominis were identified from patients reported to have travelled outside Europe. The C. parvum subtype IIaA15G2R1 and the C. mortiferum subtype XIVaA20G2T1 were the most common subtypes identified. The interviewed C. mortiferum cases did not report shared exposures such as contact with wild rodents. In conclusion, C. parvum and C. mortiferum were the major causes of cryptosporidiosis in the five studied Finnish hospital districts.},

@article{hamdi_wall-associated_2024,
 abstract = {The wall-associated kinase (WAK) and WAK-associated kinase-like (WAKL) genes belong to the major receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene family in plants. They are well-known as important candidates for directly transmitting extracellular signals to the cytoplasm by connecting the extracellular matrix with intracellular compartments. As a result, they participate in developmental processes as well as stress responses. Although genome-wide investigations of the WAK/WAKL gene family have been carried out in a number of plant species, little is known about the WAK/WAKL genes in sugar beet, Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris L. (BvWAK/WAKLs). In this study, we performed a computational large-scale characterization of the members of this gene family in sugar beet. Fifty five (55) sugar beet WAK/WAKL proteins exhibited a wide range of physicochemical properties. A total of 10 conserved motifs were identified from all BvWAK/WAKL proteins, of which 3 motifs could be used as specific motif markers for distinguishing BvWAKs from BvWAKLs. Gene structure analysis showed that most BvWAK/WAKL genes contained 3 or 4 exons with no obvious phylogenetic organization. Among BvWAK/WAKL genes, 50 were assigned to their chromosomal locations and shown to have expanded primarily through tandem duplication. Comparative phylogeny revealed that sugar beet WAK/WAKL genes were divided into six clades, and orthologous gene pairs were identified between sugar beet and its wild-related species, the sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima L.), while B. maritima lineage-specific genes provided clues for the introduction of wild genes in sugar beet cultivars. The gene expression data analysis revealed that the BvWAK/WAKL genes of susceptible and resistant cultivars were differentially expressed in response to beet cyst nematode (BCN) infection, and that 13 BvWAK/WAKL genes were up-regulated only in the resistant cultivar, suggesting that they are potentially involved in the resistance of sugar beet against this nematode. For the first time in sugar beet, our study presents an extensive computation-based knowledge platform on WAK/WAKL gene family and provides candidate genes for deeper molecular investigation of their potential role in sugar cyst nematode resistance.},

 abstract = {Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive and universally fatal neurological disorder. While some genetic causes have been discovered, much remains unknown, especially in different populations. Brachial monomelic amyotrophy (MMA) is a rare condition that mimics MND, but with a better prognosis. The genetic basis of MMA is currently unknown. In this study, DNA samples from the motor cortex of ALS cases were genotyped using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to compare results with those previously found in peripheral blood to screen for the presence of somatic mutations. Targeted sequencing of ALS genes in 28 Bangladeshi MND patients, including 11 MMA patients, was performed and compared with results from 8 UK MMA patients to establish if there was genetic link between the two diseases. Two SOD1 and a FUS mutation were found in the motor cortex samples but had previously been found in peripheral blood, not supporting the hypothesis of somatic heterogeneity. Screening of Bangladesh samples revealed 99 variants in 32 ALS risk genes, including pathogenic SOD1 mutations in 3 patients. Forty-three variants of conflicting interpretations (n=17), uncertain significance (n=12), risk factor (n=1) and unknown (n=13) were found in MMA patients, highlighting a shared genetic basis of MMA and MND. This is supported by the presence of TDP-43 pathology in UK MMA patient samples. The study discovered the genetic basis of MND in Bangladesh was overlapping but distinct compared to the UK, with no C9ORF72 mutations found in the Bangladeshi MND cases. Further work is needed to validate the variants currently designated as variants of uncertain significance in both MMA and MND patients.},

@article{hardtner_comparative_2023,
 abstract = {Background and aims
Atherosclerosis is a systemic and chronic inflammatory disease propagated by monocytes and macrophages. Yet, our knowledge on how transcriptome of these cells evolves in time and space is limited. We aimed at characterizing gene expression changes in site-specific macrophages and in circulating monocytes during the course of atherosclerosis.
Methods
We utilized apolipoprotein E-deficient mice undergoing one- and six-month high cholesterol diet to model early and advanced atherosclerosis. Aortic macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and circulating monocytes from each mouse were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We constructed a comparative directory that profiles lesion- and disease stage-specific transcriptomic regulation of the three cell types in atherosclerosis. Lastly, the regulation of one gene, Gpnmb, whose expression positively correlated with atheroma growth, was validated using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of atheroma plaque from murine and human.
Results
The convergence of gene regulation between the three investigated cell types was surprisingly low. Overall 3245 differentially expressed genes were involved in the biological modulation of aortic macrophages, among which less than 1\% were commonly regulated by the remote monocytes/macrophages. Aortic macrophages regulated gene expression most actively during atheroma initiation. Through complementary interrogation of murine and human scRNA-seq datasets, we showcased the practicality of our directory, using the selected gene, Gpnmb, whose expression in aortic macrophages, and a subset of foamy macrophages in particular, strongly correlated with disease advancement during atherosclerosis initiation and progression.
Conclusions
Our study provides a unique toolset to explore gene regulation of macrophage-related biological processes in and outside the atheromatous plaque at early and advanced disease stages.},

 abstract = {Substantial advances have been made in the development of promising HIV vaccines to eliminate HIV-1 infection. For the first time, one hundred of the most submitted HIV subtypes and CRFs were retrieved from the LANL database, and the consensus sequences of the eleven HIV proteins were obtained to design vaccines for human and mouse hosts. By using various servers and filters, highly qualified B-cell epitopes, as well as HTL and CD8 + epitopes that were common between mouse and human alleles and were also located in the conserved domains of HIV proteins, were considered in the vaccine constructs. With 90\% coverage worldwide, the human vaccine model covers a diverse allelic population, making it widely available. Codon optimization and in silico cloning in prokaryotic and eukaryotic vectors guarantee high expression of the vaccine models in human and E. coli hosts. Molecular dynamics confirmed the stable interaction of the vaccine constructs with TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9, leading to a substantial immunogenic response to the designed vaccine. Vaccine models effectively target the humoral and cellular immune systems in humans and mice; however, experimental validation is needed to confirm these findings in silico.},

The workflow was applied to predict the spectra of 367 environmental chemicals and accuracy evaluated by comparison to experimental reference spectra acquired. The molecular flexibility, number of rotatable bonds and number of electronegative atoms of a compound were negatively correlated with prediction accuracy. Few analytes are predicted to sufficient accuracy for the direct application of predicted spectra in spectral matching workflows. The m/z values of the top 5 most abundant ions of predicted spectra rarely match ions in experimental spectra, evidencing the disconnect between simulated fragmentation pathways and empirical reaction mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Self-incompatibility in Prunus species is governed by a single locus consisting of two highly multi-allelic and tightly linked genes, one coding for an F-box protein—i.e., SFB in Prunus- controlling the pollen specificity and one coding for an S-RNase gene controlling the pistil specificity. Genotyping the allelic combination in a fruit tree species is an essential procedure both for cross-based breeding and for establishing pollination requirements. Gel-based PCR techniques using primer pairs designed from conserved regions and spanning polymorphic intronic regions are traditionally used for this task. However, with the great advance of massive sequencing techniques and the lowering of sequencing costs, new genotyping-by-sequencing procedures are emerging. The alignment of resequenced individuals to reference genomes, commonly used for polymorphism detection, yields little or no coverage in the S-locus region due to high polymorphism between different alleles within the same species, and cannot be used for this purpose. Using the available sequences of Japanese plum S-loci concatenated in a rosary-like structure as synthetic reference sequence, we describe a procedure to accurately genotype resequenced individuals that allowed the analysis of the S-genotype in 88 Japanese plum cultivars, 74 of them are reported for the first time. In addition to unraveling two new S-alleles from published reference genomes, we identified at least two S-alleles in 74 cultivars. According to their S-allele composition, they were assigned to 22 incompatibility groups, including nine new incompatibility groups reported here for the first time (XXVII-XXXV).},

 abstract = {A new level of viral complexity has emerged from the isolation of green algae-infecting chloroviruses from diverse aquatic environments around the world over the past few decades. This study focuses on describing and comparing the genomic features of gammachloroviruses, previously referred to as SAG-viruses. We present 24 novel isolates capable of forming plaques on lawns of Chlorella heliozoae SAG 3.83, including the first giant virus isolated from Greenland. Together with 13 previous isolates, these new viruses form a robust dataset that we used to investigate the genomic landscape and to test whether environmental conditions influence the species diversity of gammachloroviruses. Genome sizes range from 283 kbp to 385 kbp, with one new isolate having the smallest genome found in the genus Chlorovirus. Based on phylogenomics and global genome identity analysis, we defined 10 species of “Gammachlorovirus”, half of which are represented by a single isolate. We observed a high level of genome synteny, and the tRNA islets maintain a distinct interspecific pattern, although some notable variations are evident. Our analysis reveals an open pan-genome composed of 681 COGs, more than 30\% of which consist of uncharacterized genes, highlighting significant innovative genetic potential for these viruses. Our results suggest that the subgenus “Gammachlorovirus” exhibits the greatest genetic diversity among chloroviruses, with variability that is independent of geographic location. Overall, these findings underscore the considerable diversity within these ten newly defined species and the importance of isolating and characterizing chloroviruses from new locations worldwide to enhance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of this group of giant algal viruses.},

Its formation in Aquilaria species has been expedited using various induction techniques, revealing insights into factors affecting the chemical constituents of artificially induced agarwood. Building on this, our research delved into the potential of another Thymelaeaceae member, Gyrinops versteegii, as an alternate agarwood source. Inoculation of juvenile  G. versteegii stems with local strain of Fusarium solani successfully induced the production of sesquiterpenes and chromone compounds. On a molecular level, a de novo transcriptome reconstruction and analysis highlighted biological processes related to the plant-type hypersensitive response and DNA damage 2 days post-fungal inoculation. Notably, terpenoid biosynthesis was observed only in the group exposed to the fungus for an extended duration (28 days), where DNA damage response also played a pivotal role. Despite the inherent limitations of de novo transcriptome reconstruction, capturing only a few of sesquiterpenes biosynthesis-related genes, our findings underscore the potential of G. verteegii in producing high-quality agarwood.

 abstract = {Biological control is emerging as a feasible alternative to chemical pesticides in agriculture. Measuring the microbial biocontrol agent (mBCA) populations in the environment is essential for an accurate risk assessment and to optimize the usage of an mBCA-based plant protection product. In this manuscript, a workflow to obtain a large number of qPCR markers suitable for robust strain-specific detection and quantification is presented. The workflow starts from whole genome sequencing data and consists on (i) identifying the strain-specific sequences, (ii) designing specific primer/probe sets for qPCR assays, and (iii) empirically verifying the performance of the assays. The first two stages involve exclusively computer work, but they are intended for researchers with little or no bioinformatic background: only knowledge of the BLAST suite tools and working with spreadsheets are required, and familiarity with the Galaxy environment and next-generation sequencing concepts are strongly advised. All bioinformatic work can be implemented using publically available resources and a regular desktop computer, no matter the operating system, connected to the Internet. The workflow was tested with 5 bacterial strains from different species under development as mBCAs, and yielded thousands of candidate markers and a triplex qPCR assay for each candidate mBCA. The qPCR assays were successfully tested in soils of different nature, water from different sources, and samples from different plant tissues. The mBCA detection limits and population dynamics in the different matrices are similar to those in qPCR assasys designed by other means. In summary a new accessible, amenable, cost-effective and robust, workflow to obtain a large number of strain-specific qPCR markers, is presented.},

 abstract = {We previously found that OsCUL3c is involved in the salt stress response. However, there are no definitive reports on the diversity of OsCUL3c in local Thai rice. In this study, we showed that the CUL3 group was clearly separated from the other CUL groups; next, we focused on OsCUL3c, the third CUL3 of the CUL3 family in rice, which is absent in Arabidopsis. A total of 111 SNPs and 28 indels over the OsCUL3c region, representing 79 haplotypes (haps), were found. Haplotyping revealed that group I (hap A and hap C) and group II (hap B1 and hap D) were different mutated variants, which showed their association with phenotypes under salt stress. These results were supported by cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) analyses. We found that LTR, MYC, [AP2; ERF], and NF-YB, which are related to salt stress, drought stress, and the response to abscisic acid (ABA), have distinct positions and numbers in the haplotypes of group I and group II. An RNA Seq analysis of the two predominant haplotypes from each group showed that the OsCUL3c expression of the group I representative was upregulated and that of group II was downregulated, which was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Promoter changes might affect the transcriptional responses to salt stress, leading to different regulatory mechanisms for the expression of different haplotypes. We speculate that OsCUL3c influences the regulation of salt-related responses, and haplotype variations play a role in this regulation.},

@article{hes_impact_2023,
 abstract = {Chara braunii is a model for early land plant evolution and terrestrialization. Salt stress has a profound effect on water and ion transport activities, thereby interacting with many other processes, including inorganic carbon acquisition for photosynthesis. In this study, we analyzed the impact of salt stress (5 practical salt units, PSU) on the physiology and gene expression in C. braunii. Photosynthesis was only slightly affected 6 h after salt addition and returned to control levels after 48 h. Several organic compounds such as proline, glutamate, sucrose, and 2-aminobutyrate accumulated in salt-treated thalli and might contribute to osmotic potential acclimation, whereas the amount of K+ decreased. We quantified transcript levels for 17,387 genes, of which 95 were up-regulated and 44 down-regulated after salt addition. Genes encoding proteins of the functional groups ion/solute transport and cell wall synthesis/modulation were enriched among the up-regulated genes 24–48 h after salt stress, indicating their role in osmotic acclimation. However, a homolog to land plant ERD4 osmosensors was transiently upregulated after 6 h, and phylogenetic analyses suggested that these sensors evolved in Charophyceae. Down-regulated genes were mainly related to photosynthesis and carbon metabolism/fixation, consistent with the observed lowered growth after extended cultivation. The changed expression of genes encoding proteins for inorganic carbon acquisition might be related to the impact of salt on ionic relations and inorganic carbon uptake. The results indicate that C. braunii can tolerate enhanced salt concentrations in a defined acclimation process, including distinct gene expression changes to achieve new metabolic homeostasis.},

 abstract = {Charophyceae are the most complex streptophyte algae, possessing tissue-like structures, rhizoids and a cellulose-pectin-based cell wall akin to embryophytes. Together with the Zygnematophyceae and the Coleochaetophycae, the Charophyceae form a grade in which the Zygnematophyceae share a last common ancestor with land plants. The availability of genomic data, its short life cycle, and the ease of non-sterile cultivation in the laboratory have made the species Chara braunii an emerging model system for streptophyte terrestrialization and early land plant evolution. In this study, tissue containing nodal cells was prepared under the stereomicroscope, and an RNA-seq dataset was generated and compared to transcriptome data from whole plantlets. In both samples, transcript coverage was high for genes encoding ribosomal proteins and a homolog of the putative PAX3- and PAX7-binding protein 1. Gene ontology was used to classify the putative functions of the differently expressed genes. In the nodal cell sample, main upregulated molecular functions were related to protein, nucleic acid, ATP- and DNA binding. Looking at specific genes, several signaling-related genes and genes encoding sugar-metabolizing enzymes were found to be expressed at a higher level in the nodal cell sample, while photosynthesis-and chloroplast-related genes were expressed at a comparatively lower level. We detected the transcription of 21 different genes encoding DUF4360-containing cysteine-rich proteins. The data contribute to the growing understanding of Charophyceae developmental biology by providing a first insight into the transcriptome composition of Chara nodal cells.},

 abstract = {The adult mammalian heart consists of mononuclear and binuclear cardiomyocytes (CMs) with various ploidies. However, it remains unclear whether a variation in ploidy or number of nuclei is associated with distinct functions and injury responses in CMs, including regeneration. Therefore, we investigated transcriptomes and cellular as well as nuclear features of mononucleated and binucleated CMs in adult mouse hearts with and without injury. To be able to identify the role of ploidy we analyzed control and failing human ventricular CMs because human CMs show a larger and disease-sensitive degree of polyploidization. Using transgenic Myh6-H2BmCh to identify mononucleated and binucleated mouse CMs, we found that cellular volume and RNA content were similar in both. On average nuclei of mononuclear CMs showed a 2-fold higher ploidy, as compared to binuclear CMs indicating that most mononuclear CMs are tetraploid. After myocardial infarction mononucleated and binucleated CMs in the border zone of the lesion responded with hypertrophy and corresponding changes in gene expression, as well as a low level of induction of cell cycle gene expression. Human CMs allowed us to study a wide range of polyploidy spanning from 2n to 16n. Notably, basal as well as pathological gene expression signatures and programs in failing CMs proved to be independent of ploidy. In summary, gene expression profiles were induced in proximity to injury, but independent of number of nuclei or ploidy levels in CMs.},

 abstract = {Balanced signal transduction is crucial in tissue patterning, particularly in the vasculature. Heterotopic ossification (HO) is tightly linked to vascularization with increased vessel number in hereditary forms of HO, such as Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). FOP is caused by mutations in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 leading to aberrant SMAD1/5 signaling in response to ActivinA. Whether observed vascular phenotype in human FOP lesions is connected to aberrant ActivinA signaling is unknown. Blocking of ActivinA prevents HO in FOP mice indicating a central role of the ligand in FOP. Here, we established a new FOP endothelial cell model generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iECs) to study ActivinA signaling. FOP iECs recapitulate pathogenic ActivinA/SMAD1/5 signaling. Whole transcriptome analysis identified ActivinA mediated activation of the BMP/NOTCH pathway exclusively in FOP iECs, which was rescued to WT transcriptional levels by the drug candidate Saracatinib. We propose that ActivinA causes transcriptional pre-patterning of the FOP endothelium, which might contribute to differential vascularity in FOP lesions compared to non-hereditary HO.},

An increased amount of this subpopulation is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and mortality. Objectives It is unknown to what extent intrinsic properties of RP contribute to their hyperreactive features. This study is the first providing a multifactorial approach based on ultrastructural, transcriptional, and functional analysis of RP compared to non-RP sorted by flow cytometry. Methods Reticulated platelets and non-RP were sorted after platelet staining with SYTO 13. Employing transmission electron microscopy, 1089 micrographs were analyzed for platelet size, amounts of intracellular structures, and anatomical surrogates indicating activation. Long and small RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for analyzing differential gene expression. Functional analysis of P-selectin—an upregulated mRNA in RP—was performed in healthy subjects and patients on P2Y12-inhibitors. Results Electron micrographs uncovered distinct ultrastructural differences in RP versus non-RP. Cross sections were 1.9-fold larger in RP (P {\textless} .0001). Amounts of α-granules, dense granules, open canalicular system-openings, and mitochondria were increased in RP, which persisted after adjustment for platelet size. Long RNA-seq showed 1212 upregulated transcripts that are predominantly associated to platelet shape change, aggregation, and activation; 1264 mRNAs were downregulated in RP. Small RNA-seq did not reveal any differentially expressed transcripts. Functional analysis displayed higher P-selectin expression as compared to non-RP upon ADP- or TRAP-stimulation. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that altered intrinsic structural and molecular properties contribute to the hyperreactivity of RP. These properties and an increased amount of RP may account for the association with cardiovascular risk.},

 abstract = {Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a complex inflammatory disease characterized by granulomas in the lung tissue, leading to breathing difficulties and chest pain. Its etiology remains not fully understood, with factors such as allergies, autoimmune responses and genetics playing a role. This study explores the potential of blood microbiome dysbiosis, defined as an imbalance in the microbial ecosystem, as a missing piece of the puzzle in understanding the etiology of the disease. Our objective was to apply a decision-tree supervised machine learning hierarchical model to distinguish potential patterns of microbiome dysbiosis in blood samples from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis as compared to healthy age-matched controls. Blood microbiome analysis, being individually-specific and stable, offers a unique perspective. Utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the blood microbiome composition characterized by non-normally distributed and sparse data. Because of the rarity of the disease in Bulgaria, we studied a relatively small patient group, n = 7. The findings were compared to 21 healthy age-matched controls. Bioinformatics and statistical analysis play a pivotal role in microbiome analysis, especially when discerning associations between taxonomic composition and disorders such as pulmonary sarcoidosis. By analyzing the microbial diversity, we identified alterations in the blood microbiome composition between healthy individuals and those with sarcoidosis, which potentially may trigger the disease. Advanced machine learning techniques provided additional power to the analysis, that might be overlooked by the usual group statistics, confirming the differentiation of the diversity within the studied microbiome.},

 abstract = {Epigenome editing is a promising technology, potentially allowing the stable reprogramming of gene expression profiles without alteration of the DNA sequence. Targeted DNA methylation has been successfully documented by many groups for silencing selected genes, but recent publications have raised concerns regarding its specificity. In the current work, we developed new EpiEditors for programmable DNA methylation in cells with a high efficiency and improved specificity. First, we demonstrated that the catalytically deactivated Cas9 protein (dCas9)-SunTag scaffold, which has been used earlier for signal amplification, can be combined with the DNMT3A-DNMT3L single-chain effector domain, allowing for a strong methylation at the target genomic locus. We demonstrated that off-target activity of this system is mainly due to untargeted freely diffusing DNMT3A-DNMT3L subunits. Therefore, we generated several DNMT3A-DNMT3L variants containing mutations in the DNMT3A part, which reduced their endogenous DNA binding. We analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation of selected variants and confirmed a striking reduction of untargeted methylation, most pronounced for the R887E mutant. For all potential applications of targeted DNA methylation, the efficiency and specificity of the treatment are the key factors. By developing highly active targeted methylation systems with strongly improved specificity, our work contributes to future applications of this approach.},

 abstract = {In recent years, modern life sciences research underwent a rapid development driven mainly by the technical improvements in analytical areas leading to miniaturization, parallelization, and high throughput processing of biological samples. This has led to the generation of huge amounts of experimental data. To meet these rising demands, the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) was established in 2015 as a national bioinformatics consortium aiming to provide high quality bioinformatics services, comprehensive training, powerful computing capacities (de.NBI Cloud) as well as connections to the European Life Science Infrastructure ELIXIR, with the goal to assist researchers in exploring and exploiting data more effectively.
Since its foundation, de.NBI Cloud has formed the scientific and collaborative backbone for new major German initiatives like NFDI or EOSC-Life in the European sector of computational biosciences. Above all, the cooperation with various NFDI consortia such as NFDI4Biodiversity, DataPLANT, GHGA, FAIRagro or NFDI4Microbiota showcases the power, range and flexibility of the de.NBI Cloud, especially for the national life science community.
In conclusion, the de.NBI Cloud provides the ability to unlock the full potential of research data and enables easier collaboration across different ecosystems and research areas, which in turn enables scientists to innovate and scale-up their data-driven research, not only in the life and computational biosciences, but across the different science domains addressed by the NFDI.

The resulting mitogenome is 15,784 base pairs in length and has a GC content of 29.05\%. The nucleotide composition of this mitogenome is similar to that of other insect mitogenomes, with A, T, C, and G nucleotides comprising 39.2\%, 31.7\%, 19.6\%, and 9.5\% of the mitogenome, respectively. The gene organization of the A. domesticus mitogenome is identical to that of other cricket species. The mitogenome consists of 37 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, and two rRNA genes. The congruence between PCA and Bayesian evolutionary tree analysis in clustering the divergent A. domesticus sequences highlights these genomes as candidates for further study to elucidate their distinct features and evolutionary history.},

 abstract = {Infection with the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is the cause of amebiasis. While most intestinal infections remain asymptomatic, a minority result in invasive disease. Invasive amebiasis, particularly amebic liver abscess (ALA) formation, occurs predominantly in adult men. An underlying immunopathology, crucially mediated by pro-inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes, is known to contribute to liver damage in the murine model for the disease and differs between males and females. The mechanisms behind the switch from asymptomatic colonization to parasite invasion are incompletely understood to date. In order to investigate the interaction of the parasite with the host immune system, extracellular vesicles (EVs) as communicators between host and parasite were the focus of this study. EVs are membranous vesicles released by cells into their environment that contain protein, lipids, micro RNAs (miRNAs), and other types of cargo. They are involved in intercellular communication and pathogen-derived EVs have been demonstrated to modulate the host immune response in the context of a variety of infectious diseases. E. histolytica EVs and their effects on primary murine monocytes in vitro were studied here. 

EVs were isolated from amebic clones of differing pathogenicity (low pathogenic A1 and highly pathogenic B2) and characterized with regard to their size, as well as protein and miRNA content. Mass spectrometry and miRNA sequencing revealed differences in the respective cargo between EVs of the two clones that may play a role in pathogenicity. Analysis of the proteome obtained by mass spectrometry showed that E. histolytica EVs contained known pathogenicity factors (such as galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNac) lectin and the cysteine peptidase (CP) EhCP-A5) and were enriched in transmembrane and signaling proteins. Furthermore, de novo miRNA prediction revealed novel mature E. histolytica miRNAs that were present in EVs. Stimulation of male and female primary murine monocytes with EVs in vitro resulted in a proinflammatory response independent of pathogenicity of the corresponding amebic clone. This was characterized by an increase in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-12p40, as well as the chemokines CCL3, CXCL1, and CXCL10, which was partially ablated upon heat inactivation of B2 but not A1 EVs. In addition, EV-stimulated monocytes expressed higher levels of the activation marker CD38 on their surface compared with negative controls. Transcriptome analysis revealed that EV stimulation resulted in activation of key immune pathways, including TLR, TNF, and NF-kB signaling in both male and female monocytes. While the gene expression patterns induced by EV stimulation were similar between male and female monocytes, some sex-specific differences could be detected, for example in the expression of Lhfpl2. Stimulation with A1 EVs triggered increased secretion of the granular enzyme myeloperoxidase by monocytes, an effect not observed after B2 EV stimulation. The same was observed in peripheral neutrophils. 

In summary, it was shown that A1 and B2 clones of E. histolytica release EVs containing immunogenic molecules that activate male and female monocytes, resulting in a pro-inflammatory phenotype.},

 abstract = {This investigation employed computational methodologies to assess the therapeutic potential of derivatives (1–16) of pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) as potential treatments for tuberculosis. Various computational techniques, including molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking, density functional theory, and global chemical descriptors, were employed to analyze the interactions between the ligands and target proteins. Docking results indicated that ligands 6, 7, 8, and rifampin exhibited binding affinities of −8.4, −7.4, −9.2, and − 7.2 kcal mol−1, respectively, against mycobacterium tuberculosis enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (INHA), with ligand 8 demonstrating superior inhibition. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were utilized to assess the stability of protein-ligand interactions. Remarkably, the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the INHA-ligand 8 complex remained minimal, with peak values at .40, .56, .37, and .50 nm at temperatures of 300, 305, 310, and 320 K, respectively. This suggests superior stability compared to the reference drug rifampin and INHA complex, which exhibited an RMSD range of .2 to .8 nm at 300 K. Furthermore, analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) revealed that the Egap value of ligand 8 (4.407 eV) is lower than all the reference drugs except rifampin. This comprehensive theoretical analysis positions ligand 8 as a promising candidate for anti-tuberculosis drug development, underscoring the need for further exploration through in vitro and in vivo studies.},

 abstract = {Heat stress in poultry houses, especially in warm areas, is one of the main environmental factors that restrict the growth of broilers or laying performance of layers, suppresses the immune system, and deteriorates egg quality and feed conversion ratio. The molecular mechanisms underlying the response of chicken to acute heat stress (AHS) have not been comprehensively elucidated. Therefore, the main object of the current work was to investigate the liver gene expression profile of chickens under AHS in comparison with their corresponding control groups, using four RNA-seq datasets. The meta-analysis, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, WGCNA, machine-learning, and eGWAS analyses were performed. The results revealed 77 meta-genes that were mainly related to protein biosynthesis, protein folding, and protein transport between cellular organelles. In other words, under AHS, the expression of genes involving in the structure of rough reticulum membrane and in the process of protein folding was adversely influenced. In addition, genes related to biological processes such as “response to unfolded proteins,” “response to reticulum stress” and “ERAD pathway” were differentially regulated. We introduce here a couple of genes such as HSPA5, SSR1, SDF2L1, and SEC23B, as the most significantly differentiated under AHS, which could be used as bio-signatures of AHS. Besides the mentioned genes, the main findings of the current work may shed light to the identification of the effects of AHS on gene expression profiling of domestic chicken as well as the adaptive response of chicken to environmental stresses.},

Our pipeline discovered a total of 145 potentially novel-lncRNAs. One of them (Fishcomb\_p-value = 0.06) along with another novel transcript (annotated as protein-coding; Fishcomb\_p-value = 0.03) were identified as significantly associated with AHS. We found five  known-lncRNAs and 134 mRNAs transcripts that were significantly associated with AHS. Four novel lncRNAs interact cis-regulated with 12 mRNA transcripts and are targeted by 11 miRNAs. Also six meta-lncRNAs associate with 134 meta-mRNAs through trans-acting co-expression, each targeted by 15 and 216 miRNAs, respectively. Three of the known-lncRNAs significantly co-expressed with almost 97 of the significant mRNAs (Pearson correlation p-value {\textless} 0.05). We report the mentioned three known-lncRNAs (ENSGALT00000099876, ENSGALT00000107573, and ENSGALT00000106323) as the most, significantly regulatory elements of AHS in chicken. It can be concluded that in order to alleviate the adverse effects of AHS on chicken, the manipulation of the three regulatory lncRNAs could lead to a more desirable result than the manipulation of the most significant mRNAs.},

 abstract = {Background
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1347093 shows statistically significant association with lung cancer risk, but there is no further rs1347093 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effect information. SNP rs1347093 is located in microRNA-216/-217 (miR-216/-217) locus. In addition, miR-216/-217 have pancreas-enriched expressions. In this study, we examined a potential miR-216/-217 promoter region, and investigated the effect of rs1347093-A allele on the miR-216/-217 promoter activity.
Methods
Bioinformatics analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assay, Western blotting, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay were performed.
Results
The miR-216/-217 expressions are down-regulated in pancreatic cancer. In pancreatic cancer patients carrying the rs1347093-A allele, miR-216/-217 expressions were more largely suppressed. We identified a potential promoter region in miR-216/-217 locus and further showed that rs1347093-A allele resulted in significantly reduced promoter activity in pancreatic cancer cells, which could be mediated by MEF2C activities. In terms of mechanism in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, miR-216b-5p expression was down-regulated, thereby preventing it from interacting with beclin-1 mRNA while promoting the survival of pancreatic cancer cells.
Conclusions
This study may reveal the biological relevance underlying rs1347093-A allele with an increase in pancreatic cancer risk. SNP rs1347093 could be meaningful as a novel biomarker for pancreatic cancer risk.},

Here, through analysis of an ethylene-response mutant mhz9, we identified a glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine (GYF) domain protein MHZ9, which positively regulates ethylene signaling at translational level in rice. MHZ9 is localized in RNA processing bodies. The C-terminal domain of MHZ9 interacts with OsEIN2, a central regulator of rice ethylene signaling, and the N-terminal domain directly binds to the OsEBF1/2 mRNAs for translational inhibition, allowing accumulation of transcription factor OsEIL1 to activate the downstream signaling. RNA-IP seq and CLIP-seq analyses reveal that MHZ9 associates with hundreds of RNAs. Ribo-seq analysis indicates that MHZ9 is required for the regulation of {\textasciitilde} 90\% of genes translationally affected by ethylene.

Bioinformatic analysis of prophage sequences sought to characterize these elements and identify prophage-linked genes contributing to enhanced fitness of the host bacteria in the dysbiotic gut. Using PHASTER, PhageScope and manual curation, this work has identified 15 prophages: 4 predicted to be intact, 2 predicted to be defective and 9 which are unclassified. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed spontaneous release of four of the LM41 prophages (φ1, φ2, φ4 and φ10) into the culture supernatant, with virion-like particles visualized using transmission electron microscopy. The majority (12/14) of these particles had morphology akin to podoviruses, which is consistent with morphology predictions for φ1 and φ4. We observed diversity in the lysogeny mechanisms utilized by the prophages, with examples of the classical λ-like CI/Cro system, the ICEBs1 ImmR/ImmA-like system and the Mu-like C/Ner system. Classical morons, such as toxins or immune evasion factors, were not observed. We did, however, identify a variety of genes with roles in mediating restriction modification and genetic diversity, as well as some candidate genes with potential roles in host adaptation. Despite being the most abundant entities in the intestine, there is a dearth of information about phages associated with members of the microbiome. This work begins to shed light on the contribution of these elements to the lifestyle of C. clostridioforme LM41.},

 abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used to analyze the diet of arthropods, including spiders. However, high sensitivity to DNA contamination makes it difficult to apply to organisms obtained from mass-sampling methods such as pitfall traps. An alternative is to hand-sample spiders, but it is unclear how effectively this prevents external contamination, especially with new knowledge showing the wide spread of eDNA in the environment. Protocols using bleach to remove external DNA have been tested on several invertebrates, though testing with both mass-sampling methods and spiders is lacking. Here, we used wolf spiders (Lycosidae) to assess the risk of external DNA contamination from pitfall trapping and hand sampling, and the efficacy of bleach decontamination. We first conducted a contamination experiment where we placed spiders in pitfall traps containing trapping medium and a nonprey insect species to simulate external DNA contamination. We also compared sampling methods by collecting spiders using pitfall traps and hand sampling. Spiders from the contamination experiment and sampling method comparison were either bleached or untreated, then metabarcoded using multiple primer pairs. The contamination experiment resulted in the contamination of almost all spiders from pitfall traps, which was successfully eliminated with bleaching. Interestingly, there was no difference in the number of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) detected per spider between pitfall trapping and hand sampling but bleaching resulted in significantly fewer ASV detections for both methods. Additionally, bleaching, but not sampling method, affected the taxonomic diet composition for both hand-sampled and pitfall-trapped spiders, indicating similar levels of external contamination. Our results are the first to confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used together with bleaching for spiders sampled from pitfall traps, and that hand sampling does not necessarily exclude external DNA contamination. Thus, diet studies using metabarcoding should address the risk of external contamination with field-sampled arthropods, regardless of sampling method.},

@phdthesis{huszarik_indirect_2023,
 abstract = {Chemical pollution is a ubiquitous stressor affecting streams and their linkages to riparian forests. Contaminants act by altering the emergence of aquatic insects from streams. Emergent insects can also take up contaminants and transfer them into the terrestrial ecosystem. Emergent insects are an important source of prey for riparian insectivores and changes in the emergence flux or contamination of insects can affect the riparian food web. However, little is knownabout the implications of emerging contaminants such as agricultural pesticides and wastewatereffluent on the terrestrial food web. In this dissertation, I address possible consequences ofagricultural and wastewater stream pollution for riparian insectivores, namely bats and spiders.
The contribution of aquatic prey to riparian spider diets has mainly been determined by stableisotope analysis, but DNA metabarcoding, a highly sensitive method of identifying consumedprey using DNA, promises to further detangle changes in these trophic interactions. In Chapter2, we tested a bleaching decontamination protocol to determine the suitability of using metabarcoding on spiders contaminated during sampling. We confirmed the applicability of metabarcoding, but also found that the wolf spiders (Lyocsidae) collected in riparian areas did not appear to rely strongly on aquatic prey. This informed our choice of Tetragnatha montana, which are highly reliant on aquatic prey, for the field study in Chapter 3.
We then conducted three field studies. Chapters 3 and 4 evaluate indirect trophic effects of chemical stream pollution on spiders and bats, respectively. Chapter 5 quantifies the accumulation of pesticides from the stream to riparian spiders via emergent insects. We found that riparian bats foraged more and that spiders consumed more Chironomidae at more polluted sites, indicating that there was no overall decrease in emergence due to chemical pollution. We also found that certain pesticides accumulated in emergent insects and riparian spiders. Together, this suggests that chemical stream pollution resulted in an increased dietary exposure of riparian insectivores to contaminants, rather than a decrease in prey availability.
These results demonstrate the role of streams and aquatic-terrestrial linkages in propagating stressors across ecosystem boundaries. They also show the benefit of using sensitive methods like DNA metabarcoding to unveil trophic effects of chemical pollution. Future studies should focus on quantifying the risk of contaminant uptake and potential effects for riparian bats, as well as considering how the observed drivers change in different contamination scenarios and ecosystems. This knowledge is important to protect the functionality of the riparian ecosystem and its inhabitants.},

@article{hwang_reduction_2024,
 abstract = {A hallmark of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is neurobehavioral deficits that still do not have effective treatment. Here, we present that reduction of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is critically involved in neurobehavioral deficits in FASD. We show that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) changes chromatin accessibility of Apoe locus, and causes reduction of APOE levels in both the brain and peripheral blood in postnatal mice. Of note, postnatal administration of an APOE receptor agonist (APOE-RA) mitigates motor learning deficits and anxiety in those mice. Several molecular and electrophysiological properties essential for learning, which are altered by PAE, are restored by APOE-RA. Our human genome-wide association study further reveals that the interaction of PAE and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the APOE enhancer which chromatin is closed by PAE in mice is associated with lower scores in the delayed matching-to-sample task in children. APOE in the plasma is also reduced in PAE children, and the reduced level is associated with their lower cognitive performance. These findings suggest that controlling the APOE level can serve as an effective treatment for neurobehavioral deficits in FASD.},

As clinical studies and commercial demands have progressed, there has been a growing need for large amounts of purified LV vectors. To help meet this demand, we developed CRISPR library screening methods to identify genetic perturbations in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and their derivatives that may increase LV vector titers. Briefly, LV vector-based Human CRISPR Activation and Knockout libraries (Calabrese and Brunello) were used to modify HEK293 and HEK293T cells. These cell populations were then expanded, and integrated LV vector genomes were rescued by transfection. LV vectors were harvested, and the process of sequential transduction and rescue-transfection was iterated. Through this workflow, guide RNAs (gRNAs) that target genes that may suppress or enhance LV vector production were enriched and identified with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Though more work is needed to test genes identified in this screen, we expect that perturbations of genes we identified here, such as {\textless}italic{\textgreater}TTLL12{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, which is an inhibitor of antiviral innate immunity may be introduced and multiplexed to yield cell lines with improved LV vector productivity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) tarafından 2021 yılında yayımlanan raporda gıdalarda kullanılacak bakterilerin tüm genom dizileri üzerinden risk değerlendirmesi yapılması gerekliliği vurgulanmıştır. Bu nedenle, laktik asit bakterilerinde dirençlilik geni araştırmaları önem kazanmıştır. Çünkü antibiyotik direnç genlerinin bağırsak sisteminde bulunan patojen bakterilere aktarılma olasılığı vardır ya da laktik asit bakterilerini barındıran gıdalar aracılığıyla alınmaları olasıdır. Bu nedenle, çalışmada, farklı fermente gıdalardan izole edilen dört laktik asit bakterisi (Lentilactobacillus buchneri Egmn17, Levilactobacillus brevis Atlas17, Levilactobacillus namurensis Ozge01, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Gmze16) ve probiyotik bir bakteri olan Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v suşu kullanılmıştır. Çalışmada, laktik asit bakterileri arasında en yaygın antibiyotik dirençliliği gözlenen tetrasiklin seçilmiştir. 3 bakterinin tetrasiklin antibiyotiğine orta derecede dirençli (zon çapı 15-18 mm) (299v, Gmze16 ve Egmn17) ve 2 bakterinin duyarlı (zon çapı {\textgreater}19 mm) (Atlas17 ve Ozge01) olduğu belirlenmiştir. Laktik asit bakterilerinin tüm genom sekanslarının incelenmesi sonucu, orta dirençli bakterilerin tetrasikline bağlı antimikrobiyal direnç (AMR) genlerinden tetA (MFS dışa atım pompası) ve tetO’ya (ribozomal koruma proteini) sahip oldukları görülmüştür. Levilactobacillus brevis Atlas17’de ise TetA proteini mevcutken 322. aminoasit sekansında M → T değişimi gözlenmiştir. Ayrıca probiyotik bakteri olan Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v’nin direnç genlerine sahip olması bu genlerin bağırsaktaki patojenlere aktarılma riskini de arttırmaktadır. tetA genine sahip olduğu gözlenen Levilactobacillus brevis Atlas17 gibi fenotipi duyarlı olan türler de sessiz dirençlilik genlerine sahip olduklarında bunu diğer bakterilere aktarabilmeleri olasıdır. Bu nedenle genotip ve fenotip birlikte incelenmesi önemlidir},

Using an in situ assay of nucleosome stability and DT40 cells expressing engineered forms of the histone variant we show that native H2A.Z, but not C-terminally truncated H2A.Z (H2A.Z∆C), is released from nucleosomes of peripheral heterochromatin at unusually high salt concentrations. H2A.Z and H3K9me3 landscapes are reorganized in H2A.Z∆C-nuclei and overall sensitivity of chromatin to nucleases is increased. These tail-dependent differences are recapitulated upon treatment of HeLa nuclei with the H2A.Z-tail-peptide (C9), with MNase sensitivity being increased genome-wide. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy revealed C9 binding to reconstituted nucleosomes. When introduced into live cells, C9 elicited chromatin reorganization, overall nucleosome destabilization and changes in gene expression. Thus, H2A.Z-nucleosomes influence global chromatin architecture in a tail-dependent manner, what can be modulated by introducing the tail-peptide into live cells.},

 abstract = {The Doñana wetlands comprise an emblematic Mediterranean landscape protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some parts of these wetlands have been transformed into intensive rice cultivation areas, which are currently the most productive rice-growing areas in Europe. We examined the bacterial communities in these domesticated soils as they are key for plant health and productivity and have a strong influence on biochemical cycles. To identify the bacteria, we used metabarcoding analysis coupled with metabolic predictions and co-occurrence networks. This analysis was performed in the bulk and rhizosphere soils during different stages in the growing season. These soil compartments had a greater effect on the bacterial communities than the plant phenological stages. The diversity and richness of the bacterial population inhabiting the rhizosphere was much lower than that in the bulk soil, comprising taxa that were significantly more represented in this soil compartment, such as bacteria from the genus Hydrogenophaga, three genera from the order Rhizobiales, and unclassified genera from the families Desulfocapsaceae and Actinobacteria. Rhizosphere co-occurrence networks revealed a high number of negative connections, indicating unstable bacterial communities that may be highly influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. Rhizosphere networks mostly rely on two taxa belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, which are the predicted network hubs in this soil compartment. The bulk soil conserved high bacterial diversity and richness that was stable throughout the growth period of rice. Anaerobic bacteria from genera Marmoricola, the uncultured Gemmatimonadota bacteria SDR1034 terrestrial group, Anaerolinea, and the sulphur oxidizer, Thiobacillus were highly represented. This analysis provides valuable information for understanding bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of rice cultivated in this region, which is critical for enhancing plant growth and productivity.},

 abstract = {Citrus crops are affected by many fungal diseases. Among them, Citrus Black Spot caused by the ascomycete Phyllosticta citricarpa is particularly economically damaging wherever it occurs. Many other species of Phyllosticta are described on Citrus, but only P. citricarpa is considered a quarantine pest on the European continent. In order to prevent the introduction of this species into Europe, it is essential to have a detection test which can reliably identify it, and not confuse it with other species present on citrus, notably P. paracitricarpa. The latter taxon has recently been described as very close to P. citricarpa, and most detection tests do not allow to distinguish the two species. In this work, we exploited the genomic data of 37 isolates of Phyllosticta spp. from citrus, firstly to assess their phylogenetic relationships, and secondly to search for genomic regions that allowed the definition of species-specific markers of P. citricarpa. Analysis of 51 concatenated genes separated P. citricarpa and P. paracitricarpa in two phylogenetic clades. A locus was selected to define a hydrolysis probe and primers combination that could be used in real-time PCR for the specific detection of the quarantine species, to the exclusion of all others present on Citrus. This test was then thoroughly validated on a set of strains covering a wide geographical diversity, and on numerous biological samples to demonstrate its reliability for regulatory control. The validation data highlighted the need to check the reliability of the test in advance, when a change of reagents was being considered.},

Despite the role of bacteriophages as drivers for microbiome structure and function, there is no information about the structure and function of the gut virome in gnotobiotic models and the link between bacterial and bacteriophage/prophage diversity. We studied the virome of gnotobiotic murine Oligo-MM12 (12 bacterial species) and reduced Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF, three bacterial species). As reference, the virome of Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) mice was investigated. A metagenomic approach was used to assess prophages and bacteriophages in the guts of 6-week-old female mice. We identified a positive correlation between bacteria diversity, and bacteriophages and prophages. Caudoviricetes (82.4\%) were the most prominent class of phages in all samples with differing relative abundance. However, the host specificity of bacteriophages belonging to class Caudoviricetes differed depending on model bacterial diversity. We further studied the role of bacteriophages in horizontal gene transfer and microbial adaptation to the host’s environment. Analysis of mobile genetic elements showed the contribution of bacteriophages to the adaptation of bacterial amino acid metabolism. Overall, our results implicate virome “dark matter” and interactions with the host system as factors for microbial community structure and function which determine host health. Taking the importance of the virome in the microbiome diversity and horizontal gene transfer, reductions in the virome might be an important factor driving losses of microbial biodiversity and the subsequent dysbiosis of the gut microbiome.},

 abstract = {Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (WW) is a promising tool for epidemiological surveillance, correlating not only viral RNA levels with the infection dynamics within the population, but also to viral diversity. However, the complex mixture of viral lineages in WW samples makes tracking of specific variants or lineages circulating in the population a challenging task. We sequenced sewage samples of 9 WW-catchment areas within the city of Rotterdam, used specific signature mutations from individual SARS-CoV-2 lineages to estimate their relative abundances in WW and compared them against those observed in clinical genomic surveillance of infected individuals between September 2020 and December 2021. We showed that especially for dominant lineages, the median of the frequencies of signature mutations coincides with the occurrence of those lineages in Rotterdam's clinical genomic surveillance. This, along with digital droplet RT-PCR targeting signature mutations of specific variants of concern (VOCs), showed that several VOCs emerged, became dominant and were replaced by the next VOC in Rotterdam at different time points during the study. In addition, single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis provided evidence that spatio-temporal clusters can also be discerned from WW samples. We were able to detect specific SNVs in sewage, including one resulting in the Q183H amino acid change in the Spike gene, that was not captured by clinical genomic surveillance. Our results highlight the potential use of WW samples for genomic surveillance, increasing the set of epidemiological tools to monitor SARS-CoV-2 diversity.},

 abstract = {Background The histone methyltransferase DOT1L catalyzes methylation of H3K79 and it is highly conserved in mammals. DOT1L plays a functional role in several biological processes including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, RNA splicing and gene expression, suggesting a complex role in chromatin organization and regulation. Such a remarkable range of functions performed by DOT1L can be the result, at least partially, of its interaction with a plethora of proteins and presence in different complexes.
Results Here, we characterized the cooperation of DOT1L with the nucleolar protein NPM1 and the impact of both proteins on peri-nucleolar heterochromatin activity. We show that i) DOT1L interacts preferentially with monomeric NPM1 in the nucleus; ii) DOT1L acts in concert with NPM1 to maintain each other’s protein homeostasis; iii) NPM1 depletion results in H3K79me2 upregulation at chromatin remodeling genes but does not affect their expression; iv) DOT1L and NPM1 preserved DNA satellite expression at perinucleolar heterochromatin via epigenetic mechanisms dependent on H3K27me3.
Conclusions Our findings give insights into molecular mechanisms employed by DOT1L and NPM1 to regulate heterochromatin activities around the nucleoli and shed light on one aspect of the complex role of both proteins in chromatin dynamics.},

By examining and elucidating microbial genomes in healthy and infected samples, the metagenomics branch has allowed us to discover the significance of microbial genomes. The metagenomic approach used in the covid-19 infectious disease will serve as a prominent tool for explicating the relationship between host-associated microbial communities and host phenotype. European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) was used to retrieve the metagenome data of the Gut Microbiome of Covid-19 patients with the project id PRJDB12349. For metagenomics analyses, Galaxy server was used identification and classification of microbial communities furhter taxonomic analysis and functional analysis was also performed. Different tools from the galaxy like FastQC, MultiQC, Trim Galore, Megahit, Kraken 2, Convert Kraken, Krona Pie Chart and HUMANn2 were used for complete metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic Analysis shows that there is difference in the percentage and abundance of bacteria in all the covid-19 patients sample. The fungi that were commonly present in all the samples were identified as Eurotiales 78-93\% and Mycospaerellales 7-20\% and the other fungi that were not common but were observed are Dipodasceae 10\% and Sordariales 4-6\%. Further, the gene abundance and the families of the samples were also observed. This study highlights the metagenome of the Covid-19 infectious disease.

Here, we report the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the mAb cocktail REGN-COV in a kidney transplant patient with hypogammaglobulinemia. Following mAb treatment, the patient did not clear the infection. During viral persistence, SARS-CoV-2 acquired three novel spike mutations. Neutralization and mouse protection analyses demonstrate a complete viral escape from REGN-COV at the expense of ACE-2 binding. Final clearance of the virus occurred upon reduction of the immunosuppressive regimen and total IgG substitution. Serology suggests that the development of highly neutralizing IgM rather than IgG substitution aids clearance. Our findings emphasise that selection pressure by mAbs on SARS-CoV-2 can lead to development of escape variants in immunocompromised patients. Thus, modification of immunosuppressive therapy, if possible, might be preferable to control and clearance of the viral infection.},

 abstract = {The current human reference genome, GRCh38, represents over 20 years of effort to generate a high-quality assembly, which has benefitted society1,2. However, it still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological genome as it is a blend of multiple individuals3,4. Recently, a high-quality telomere-to-telomere reference, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a nearly homozygous genome5. To address these limitations, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium formed with the goal of creating high-quality, cost-effective, diploid genome assemblies for a pangenome reference that represents human genetic diversity6. Here, in our first scientific report, we determined which combination of current genome sequencing and assembly approaches yield the most complete and accurate diploid genome assembly with minimal manual curation. Approaches that used highly accurate long reads and parent–child data with graph-based haplotype phasing during assembly outperformed those that did not. Developing a combination of the top-performing methods, we generated our first high-quality diploid reference assembly, containing only approximately four gaps per chromosome on average, with most chromosomes within ±1\% of the length of CHM13. Nearly 48\% of protein-coding genes have non-synonymous amino acid changes between haplotypes, and centromeric regions showed the highest diversity. Our findings serve as a foundation for assembling near-complete diploid human genomes at scale for a pangenome reference to capture global genetic variation from single nucleotides to structural rearrangements.},

 abstract = {The plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae poses a significant threat to global food security, and its management through the cultivation of resistant varieties and crop husbandry practices, including fungicidal sprays, has proven to be inadequate. To address this issue, we conducted small-RNA sequencing to identify the roles of miRNAs and their target genes in both resistant (PB1637) and susceptible (PB1) rice genotypes. We confirmed the expression of differentially expressed miRNAs using stem-loop qRT-PCR analysis and correlated them with rice patho-phenotypic and physio-biochemical responses. Our findings revealed several noteworthy differences between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. The resistant genotype exhibited reduced levels of total chlorophyll and carotenoids compared to the susceptible genotype. However, it showed increased levels of total protein, callose, H2O2, antioxidants, flavonoids, and total polyphenols. Additionally, among the defense-associated enzymes, guaiacol peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase responses were higher in the susceptible genotypes. In our comparative analysis, we identified 27 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated miRNAs in the resistant genotype, while the susceptible genotype exhibited 44 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated miRNAs. Furthermore, we discovered eight up-regulated and five down-regulated miRNAs shared between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. Notably, we also identified six novel miRNAs in the resistant genotype and eight novel miRNAs in the susceptible genotype. These novel miRNAs, namely Chr8\_26996, Chr12\_40110, and Chr12\_41899, were found to negatively correlate with the expression of predicted target genes, including Cyt-P450 monooxygenase, serine carboxypeptidase, and zinc finger A20 domain-containing stress-associated protein, respectively. The results of our study on miRNA and transcriptional responses provide valuable insights for the development of future rice lines that are resistant to blast disease. By understanding the roles of specific miRNAs and their target genes in conferring resistance, we can enhance breeding strategies and improve crop management practices to ensure global food security.},

@article{jdeed_redistribution_2022,
 abstract = {Therapeutic targets in cancer cells defective for the tumor suppressor ARID1A are fundamentals of synthetic lethal strategies. However, whether modulating ARID1A function in premalignant breast epithelial cells could be exploited to reduce carcinogenic potential remains to be elucidated. In search of chromatin-modulating mechanisms activated by anti-proliferative agents in normal breast epithelial (HME-hTert) cells, we identified a distinct pattern of genome-wide H3K27 histone acetylation marks characteristic for the combined treatment by the cancer preventive rexinoid bexarotene (Bex) and carvedilol (Carv). Among these marks, several enhancers functionally linked to TGF-β signaling were enriched for ARID1A and Brg1, subunits within the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. The recruitment of ARID1A and Brg1 was associated with the suppression of TGFBR2, KLF4, and FoxQ1, and the induction of BMP6, while the inverse pattern ensued upon the knock-down of ARID1A. Bex+Carv treatment resulted in fewer cells expressing N-cadherin and dictated a more epithelial phenotype. However, the silencing of ARID1A expression reversed the ability of Bex and Carv to limit epithelial–mesenchymal transition. The nuclear levels of SMAD4, a canonical mediator of TGF-β action, were more effectively suppressed by the combination than by TGF-β. In contrast, TGF-β treatment exceeded the ability of Bex+Carv to lower nuclear FoxQ1 levels and induced markedly higher E-cadherin positivity, indicating a target-selective antagonism of Bex+Carv to TGF-β action. In summary, the chromatin-wide redistribution of ARID1A by Bex and Carv treatment is instrumental in the suppression of genes mediating TGF-β signaling, and, thus, the morphologic reprogramming of normal breast epithelial cells. The concerted engagement of functionally linked targets using low toxicity clinical agents represents an attractive new approach for cancer interception.},

 abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been frequently reported in companion dogs and cats worldwide during the ongoing coronavirus disease. However, RT-qPCR methods developed for humans have been used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections in suspected companion dogs and cats owing to the lack of the companion animal-tailored methods. Therefore, we developed a multiplex RT-qPCR (mRT-qPCR) using newly designed primers and probes targeting RdRp and N genes of all currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the canine or feline 16S rRNA gene as an endogenous internal positive control (EIPC) for reliable diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from suspected dogs and cats. The developed mRT-qPCR assay specifically detected the target genes of SARS-CoV-2 but no other canine or feline pathogens. Furthermore, canine and feline EIPCs were stably amplified by mRT-qPCR in samples containing canine- or feline-origin cellular materials. This assay has high repeatability and reproducibility, with an optimal limit of detection ({\textless}10 RNA copies per reaction) and coefficients of variation ({\textless}1.0\%). The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 of the developed mRT-qPCR was 6.6\% for canine and feline nasopharyngeal samples, which was consistent with that of a commercial mRT-qPCR kit for humans. Collectively, the newly developed mRT-qPCR with canine and feline EIPC can efficiently diagnose and evaluate the viral load in field specimens and will be a valuable tool for etiological diagnosis, epidemiological study, and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections in canine and feline populations.},

 abstract = {Dipylidium caninum (Linnaeus, 1758) is a common zoonotic cestode of dogs and cats worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of largely host-associated canine and feline genotypes based on infection studies, differences at the 28S rDNA gene, and complete mitochondrial genomes. There have been no comparative genome-wide studies. Here, we sequenced the genomes of a dog and cat isolate of Dipylidium caninum from the United States using the Illumina platform at mean coverage depths of 45× and 26× and conducted comparative analyses with the reference draft genome. Complete mitochondrial genomes were used to confirm the genotypes of the isolates. Genomes of D. caninum canine and feline genotypes generated in this study, had an average identity of 98\% and 89\%, respectively, when compared to the reference genome. SNPs were 20 times higher in the feline isolate. Comparison and species delimitation using universally conserved orthologs and protein-coding mitochondrial genes revealed that the canine and feline isolates are different species. Data from this study build a base for future integrative taxonomy. Further genomic studies from geographically diverse populations are necessary to understand implications for taxonomy, epidemiology, veterinary clinical medicine, and anthelmintic resistance.},

 abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that persists as a global threat to the world. A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4), has emerged as a potential target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity-related disorders. The current study has investigated the FFAR4, deploying 3-dimensional structure modeling, molecular docking, machine learning, and high-throughput virtual screening methods to unravel the receptor’s crucial and non-crucial binding site residues. We screened four lakh compounds and shortlisted them based on binding energy, stereochemical considerations, non-bonded interactions, and pharmacokinetic profiling. Out of the screened compounds, four compounds were selected for ligand-bound simulations. The molecular dynamic simulations were carried out for 1µs for native FFAR4 and 500 ns each for complexes of FFAR4 with compound 1, compound 2, compound 3, and compound 4. Our findings showed that in addition to reported binding site residues ARG99, ARG183, and VAL98 in known agonists like TUG-891, the amino acids ARG22, ARG24, THR23, TRP305, and GLU43 were also critical binding site residues. These amino acids impart stability to the FFAR4 complexes and contribute to the stronger binding affinity of the compounds. The study also indicated that aromatic residues like PHE211 are crucial for recognizing the active site’s pi-pi and C-C double bonds. Since FFAR4 is a membrane protein, the simulation studies give an insight into the mechanisms of the crucial protein-lipid and lipid-water interactions. The analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories showed all four compounds as potential hit molecules that can be developed further into potential agonists for T2DM therapy. Amongst the four compounds, compound 4 showed relatively better binding affinity, stronger non-bonded interactions, and a stable complex. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma},

 abstract = {Salmonella is a widespread pathogen that can cause a variety of disease syndromes, thereby having a tremendous impact on human health and animal husbandry. Currently, whole genome sequencing technology has been widely used to study the phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella, primarily using the Illumina short-read platform. Complete genome sequence data of Salmonella are rarely systematically analyzed in similar studies considering the relatively high cost currently. Therefore, here we collected the complete genome sequence data of 1819 Salmonella in GenBank and classified these strains into different subspecies, serovars, and STs by SISTR, Seqsero2, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and other sophisticated software. In addition, we constructed and demonstrated different phylogenetic trees by four methods with high discriminatory power: core single-nucleotide polymorphism typing, core genome MLST (cgMLST), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat typing, and pan-genome typing. The different typing methods are systematically presented, along with a comparison of the characteristics of the four distinct typing methods used in this chapter. In conclusion, we have made a new attempt to use complete genome sequence datasets to study the phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella. Additional considerations regarding the time required to be consumed, the clustering effect, and the cgMLST method are also discussed.},

Among DYRK class II members, dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) is the functional target for prostate cancer treatment. Studies show that subfamilies of DYRKs are also capable to phosphorylate (tyrosine, serine, and threonine) residues, yet little research has been carried out for its inhibitors. In this article, conceptual density theory is used to estimate the physicochemical properties of 30 experimentally synthesized inhibitors targeting DYRK2. The HOMO–LUMO gap showed low reactivity and high chemical activity for the inhibitors. The biological efficacy of these 30 inhibitors is predicted by bioavailability, mutagenicity, and cardiotoxicity measures. The inhibitors showed low toxicity and no blood brain barrier permeability. Results indicated that the physiological actions of these inhibitors involve multiple target interactions. Since the experimental results of the DYRK2 protein showed great water solubility, favorable safety properties, and potential anti-prostate cancer activities for ligand 24, docking and molecular dynamics simulations from the Galaxy webserver using Gromacs open-source tools are also performed for (DYRK2-24) complex (PDB: 7EJV).

This study focuses on the theoretical evaluation of 16 orally bioavailable, small-molecule MC4R antagonists identified through experimental hit identification processes. Conceptual Density Functional Theory (CDFT) is applied to study the reactivity and stability of 16 antagonists. The physicochemical properties and metabolic activities are studied using various bioinformatics tools. Ramachandran plot analysis of MC4R protein is carried out for experimental MC4R protein structure. The active sites for MC4R protein is predicted with Active site prediction tool. MD simulations for (MC4R-antagonists) are carried out with HDOCK server. The (MC4R-16) complex showed strong binding interactions which validated the experimental results. MD simulations for Alphafold3 docked (MC4R-16) complex is carried out using Galaxy based GroMacs tools for 30 ns due to potential shortcomings of the single-trajectory approach. Further various tools are used to evaluate the physicochemical properties, metabolic properties and toxicity assessment of the studied 16 complexes. SwissTargetPrediction webserver is used to predict the multitarget activities of the antagonists. High ionization potentials (IP), low electron affinities (EA), and larger HOMO–LUMO (HL) gaps suggest the stability and reactivity of complexes. All 16 MC4R antagonists are found to be non-toxic (MUT, TUM), with its potential safety for arrhythmia and hypertension. High gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability is observed for the antagonists. (MC4R-16) complex demonstrated system adaptability and increased conformational flexibility in loop regions, with strong hydrophobic interactions, validating the experimental findings which showed that complex 16 is effective in an aged rat model of anorexia-cachexia syndrome and has progressed to clinical trials.},

In this work, we have selected flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum), also known as linseed to study its pharmacological efficacy and proposed mechanisms of action for medicinal purposes. The target genes of linseed with disease specificity index (DSI {\textgreater} 0.6) are compared to the associated genes of diabetes mellitus, decrease in appetite, addictive behavior, cardiovascular diseases, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IMD), Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and the selected genes are evaluation further using in silico methods. The binding affinity of flaxseed to three common target proteins family (CCDC28b, PDCD6IP and USP34) is assessed by docking and Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results show that linseed is safe to use for mutagenic toxicity and other cardiotoxicity measures but linseed is unsafe for embryotoxicity, herG toxicity and cardiac failure.

 abstract = {Key Points 

Parenchymal T cells in the kidney expressed much higher levels of P2X7 than vascular T cells.
P2X7-blocking nanobodies uncover a large fraction of kidney-resident natural killer T and tissue-resident memory T cells.
These cells were lost during cell preparation because of activation of P2X7 by NAD+ released from damaged cells, unless blocked by nanobodies.


Background 
The P2X7 ion channel, a key sensor of sterile inflammation, has been implicated as a therapeutic target in GN, and P2X7-antagonistic nanobodies can attenuate experimental GN. However, little is known about the expression of P2X7 on renal immune cells.
Methods 
We used conventional immunofluorescence of kidney sections and intraperitoneal injection of nanobodies in mice followed by flow cytometry analysis of parenchymal T cells and RNA sequencing to elucidate the expression and function of P2X7 on parenchymal and vascular immune cells in the mouse kidney.
Results 
Our study showed that parenchymal T cells, including a large subset of natural killer T cells and CD69+ tissue-resident memory T cells, display much higher cell surface levels of P2X7 than vascular T cells. After a single intraperitoneal injection of P2X7-blocking nanobodies, P2X7 on parenchymal T cells was fully occupied by the injected nanobodies within 30 minutes. This resulted in an effective protection of these cells from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–induced cell death during cell preparation. Conversely, systemic injection of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide that mimics sterile inflammation results in the selective depletion of P2X7hiCD69hi T cells from the kidney parenchyma.
Conclusions 
Our study uncovered a novel purinergic regulatory mechanism affecting kidney-resident T-cell populations.

UP1A-1 isolated from healthy solanaceae rhizosphere soil, exhibited the lowest disease incidence and increased fruit yield of solanaceae vegetables. However, the genomic and functional properties of UP1A-1 are unclear. Therefore, we conducted the present study to elucidate the genomic characteristics of UP1A-1 by whole genome sequencing. The results indicate that the genome of Streptomyces sp. UP1A-1 consists of 8,252,902 bp and contains 72.42 \% G + C. We identified the genes that confer plant growth promoting (PGP) function, which include those involved in siderophore production, indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis, phosphate solubilization, nitrogen metabolism, and potassium metabolism. We also identified several other genes, such as chitinase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, proline biosynthesis, and glucose dehydrogenase, which are believed to be involved in the control of wilt disease. These genes revealed that the strain UP1A-1 has physiologically adapted to varied environmental conditions and could potentially control both abiotic and biotic stresses.},

Recent advances in omics technologies and high-throughput sequencing have made the identification and characterization of bacteria. This study firstly aimed to demonstrate the sensitivity of the Vitek MS (MALDI-TOF) system in the identification of lactic acid bacteria and, secondly, to characterize bacteria using various bioinformatics approaches. Probiotic potency-related genes and secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters were examined. The Vitek MS (MALDI-TOF) system was able to identify all of the bacteria at the genus level. According to whole genome sequencing, the bacteria were confirmed to be Lentilactobacillus buchneri, Levilactobacillus brevis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Levilactobacillus namurensis. Bacteria had most of the probiotic potency-related genes, and different toxin-antitoxin systems such as PemIK/MazEF, Hig A/B, YdcE/YdcD, YefM/YoeB. Also, some of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, some toxic metabolite-related genes, and antibiotic resistance-related genes were detected. In addition, Lentilactobacillus buchneri Egmn17 had a type II-A CRISPR/Cas system. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Gmze16 had a bacteriocin, plantaricin E/F.},

 abstract = {The switch/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) complex is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller that regulates the spacing of nucleosomes and thereby controls gene expression. Heterozygous mutations in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF complex have been reported in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), with the majority of the mutations in \textit{ARID1B}. CSS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, digital anomalies, and variable intellectual disability. We hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding subunits of the ubiquitously expressed SWI/SNF complex may lead to alterations of the nucleosome profiles in different cell types. We performed the first study on CSS-patient samples and investigated the nucleosome landscapes of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from blood plasma by whole-genome sequencing. In addition, we studied the nucleosome landscapes of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes from CSS-affected individuals by nucleosome occupancy and methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) as well as their expression profiles. In cfDNA of CSS-affected individuals with heterozygous \textit{ARID1B} mutations, we did not observe major changes in the nucleosome profile around transcription start sites. In CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes, we found few genomic regions with different nucleosome occupancy when compared to controls. RNA-seq analysis of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes of these individuals detected only few differentially expressed genes, which were not in proximity to any of the identified differential nucleosome-depleted regions. In conclusion, we show that heterozygous mutations in the human SWI/SNF subunit ARID1B do not have a major impact on the nucleosome landscape or gene expression in blood cells. This might be due to functional redundancy, cell-type specificity, or alternative functions of ARID1B.},

SORCS2 is also expressed in the pancreas, yet its action in this tissue remains unknown. Combining metabolic studies in SORCS2-deficient mice with ex vivo functional analyses and single-cell transcriptomics of pancreatic tissues, we identified a role for SORCS2 in protective stress response in pancreatic islets, essential to sustain insulin release. We show that SORCS2 is predominantly expressed in islet alpha cells. Loss of expression coincides with inability of these cells to produce osteopontin, a secreted factor that facilitates insulin release from stressed beta cells. In line with diminished osteopontin levels, beta cells in SORCS2-deficient islets show gene expression patterns indicative of aggravated cell stress, and exhibit defects in insulin granule maturation and a blunted glucose response. These findings corroborate a function for SORCS2 in protective stress response that extends to metabolism.},

 abstract = {Spot blotch disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana, poses a significant threat to global production particularly wheat, and barley due to substantial yield losses. Similar to many fungal pathogens, the infection of host plants heavily depends on the pathogen's ability to secrete effector proteins, which manipulate host defenses and aid disease progression. However, a critical knowledge gap exists in the comprehensive identification and characterization of effector candidates (ECs) in B. sorokiniana, requiring further research efforts. Therefore, study aimed to systematically identify and characterize ECs in B. sorokiniana by conducting pathogenicity tests to confirm disease symptoms on wheat leaves, utilizing a rigorous bioinformatics approach to predict ECs through sequence analysis and structural similarities, and validating effector expression profiles during infection using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Pathogenicity testing confirmed the typical symptoms of spot blotch disease upon inoculation with B. sorokiniana. Through bioinformatics analysis, 81 ECs were identified, showing dynamic expression patterns during infection stages. Among these ECs, genes such as Cocsa1{\textbar}129517, Cocsa1{\textbar}141231, and Cocsa1{\textbar}193443 stood out due to their different expression patterns and structural similarities, indicating their potential roles as effectors. This study offers new novel insights into the effector repertoire of B. sorokiniana and its implications for spot blotch disease management. The identified ECs present promising targets for further investigation to clarify their specific roles in fungal virulence and host immune modulation.},

@article{kandinov_azithromycin_2023,
 abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the resistance to macrolides (azithromycin) in the modern Russian population of N. gonorrhoeae with the analysis of genetic resistance determinants. Azithromycin is not used to treat gonococcal infection in Russia. However, among 162 isolates collected in 2020–2021, 22 isolates (13.6\%) were phenotypically resistant to azithromycin. Mutations in 23S rRNA genes were found only in two isolates; erm and mefA genes were absent. Azithromycin resistance was shown to be predominantly associated with mutations in the mtrR and mtrD genes of the MtrCDE efflux pump and their mosaic alleles which may have formed due to a horizontal transfer from N. meningitidis. A total of 30 types of mtrR alleles and 10 types of mtrD alleles were identified including mosaic variants. Matching between the mtrR and mtrD alleles was revealed to indicate the cooperative molecular evolution of these genes. A link between the mtrR and mtrD alleles and NG-MAST types was found only for NG-MAST 228 and 807, typical of N. gonorrhoeae in Russia. The high level of resistance to azithromycin in Russia may be related to the spread of multiple transferable resistance to antimicrobials regardless of their use in the treatment of gonococcal infection.},

Clinical N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in 2018–2021 (428 isolates) were analyzed. No azithromycin-resistant isolates were found in 2018–2019, but in 2020–2021, a significant increase in the ratio of azithromycin-resistant isolates was observed: 16.8\% and 9.3\%, respectively. A hydrogel DNA microarray was developed for the analysis of resistance determinants: mutations in the genes encoding the mtrCDE efflux system and in all four copies of the 23S rRNA gene (position 2611). A majority of the azithromycin-resistant Russian isolates belonged to the NG-MAST G12302 genogroup, and the resistance was associated with the presence of a mosaic structure of the mtrR gene promoter region with the −35 delA deletion, an Ala86Thr mutation in the mtrR gene, and a mosaic structure of the mtrD gene. A comparative phylogenetic study of modern Russian and European N. gonorrhoeae populations allowed us to conclude that the emergence of azithromycin resistance in Russia in 2020 was the result of the appearance and spread of European N. gonorrhoeae strains belonging to the G12302 genogroup due to possible cross-border transfer.},

The objective of this study was to design and validate a mini-MLST scheme for N. gonorrhoeae based on global pathogen population data. Using sequences of seven housekeeping genes of 21,402 isolates with known MLSTs from the PubMLST database, we identified eighteen informative polymorphisms and obtained mini-MLST nucleotide profiles to predict MLSTs of isolates. We proposed a new MLST grouping system for N. gonorrhoeae based on mini-MLST profiles. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MLST genogroups are a stable characteristic of the N. gonorrhoeae global population. The proposed grouping system has been shown to bring together isolates with similar antimicrobial susceptibility, as demonstrated by the characteristics of major genogroups. Established MLST prediction algorithms based on nucleotide profiles are now publicly available. The mini-MLST scheme was evaluated using a MLST detection/prediction method based on the original hydrogel DNA microarray. The results confirmed a high predictive ability up to the MLST genogroup. The proposed holistic approach to gonococcal population analysis can be used for the continuous surveillance of known and emerging resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates.},

A total of 33 quinolone derivatives were assessed for their physicochemical properties and effectiveness against a range of clinically relevant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Molecular docking studies identified compounds 28, 29, 32, and 33 as having notable binding affinities, particularly against MRSA. Further molecular dynamics simulations of compound 29 confirmed its favorable stability and potential for disrupting MRSA, reinforcing the docking results and showing strong alignment with in vitro findings.

One such Pasteurella like organism, Bisgaard taxon 14 was classified as Spirabiliibacterium mucosae. In the present study, a Gram-negative organism was isolated from ailing pigeons with respiratory infection from a farm in Tamil Nadu, India and the organism was misidentified as Burkholderia mallei by Vitek 2 compact system based on biochemical characterization. Since, B. mallei is highly pathogenic and zoonotic, to further confirm, 16S rDNA sequencing and analysis was carried out which revealed that the strain belonged to Bisgaard taxon 14 (Spirabiliibacterium mucosae). To further confirm the findings, whole genome sequencing of the isolate was performed. Whole genome phylogeny and average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis showed that the genome was closely matching with Spirabiliibacterium mucosae type strain 20,609 /3. Hence, the strain from pigeon was named as Spirabiliibacterium mucosae TN\_CUL\_2021 and the genome was submitted in NCBI SRA database. The genome of S. mucosase TN\_CUL\_2021 is only the second genome available worldwide in the NCBI database. Comparative genome analysis of 26 Pasteurellaceae family strains revealed 1101 genes specific for Spirabiliibacterium mucosae. Similarly, luxS virulence gene was found only in S. mucosae and Bisgaardia hudsonensis strains. Since there are only 2 genomes available in the NCBI genome database, further studies on isolation of S. mucosae needs to be carried out to identify its epidemiology and pathogenesis so as to develop better diagnostic assays and vaccines.},

 abstract = {The domain of unknown function (DUF221 domain-containing) proteins regulates various aspects of plant growth, development, responses to abiotic stresses, and hormone transduction pathways. A comprehensive genome-wide analysis was performed in its genome to understand the role of DDP genes (DUF221) in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). A total of 12 DDP genes were identified and distributed in 8 chromosomes in the common bean genome. The physical and biochemical characteristics of amino acids, motif and intron–exon structure, and cis-regulatory elements of DDP members were determined. Phylogenetically all PvDDPs were clustered into nine clades, subsequently supported by their gene structure and conserved motifs distribution. The PvDDPs contained various cis-acting elements involved in plant responses to abiotic and various phytohormones stresses. A total of 45 different cis-regulatory elements in the putative promoter regions of the PvDDPs were identified. ERE and ABRE were discovered to be present in all PvDDPs, indicating that they may be regulated by ethylene and ABA, both of which are strongly associated with biotic stress response in plant species. Additionally, PvDDPs were targeted by multiple miRNA gene families as well. In this context, the most targeted DDP family members are PvDD10 and PvDDP11. The miRNA target analysis showed that Pvu-miR2594, Pvu-miR169, Pvu-miR2584, Pvu-miR530, Pvu-miR156, and Pvu-miR2592 target these genes. There is a strong correlation between abiotic stress and PvDDPs expression in both leaf and root tissues. PvDDP11 is the unique and highest upregulated gene with hormone treatment and abiotic stress among all the members. Expression of the PvDDP11 gene indicated a strong correlation with drought and salt stress in the common bean roots and leaves, respectively. In conclusion, this study predicted that the putative DDP genes might help improve abiotic and phytohormone tolerance in common bean.},

 abstract = {The Human Genome Annotation (HGA) file is a database where different features describing elements of the genome (genes, transcripts, etc) are stored. HGA is the process of identifying those elements, characterizing them and elucidating their roles. Currently, HGA is still incomplete because it suffers from missed annotation and mis-annotation. Mis-annotation happens when some elements are wrongly annotated or labeled. Missed annotation happens when some elements are absent from the annotation files due to the limitations of analytical and experimental procedures. On one hand, improved identification of novel genome elements is required to help solve the problem of missed annotation. On the other hand, to address the problem of mis-annotation, better classification methods are needed to characterize and validate the novel elements. This thesis addresses the problem of incomplete human genome annotation and proposes an improved identification and validation approach via integration of second and third generation of sequencing. We apply this integrative approach to detect novel mono-exonic genes (MNEGs) and confirm their transcription and translation. Up until recent studies, MNEGs were thought to be artifacts and were discarded. However, our integrative analysis provided additional evidence for the genuine existence of these genes. In the second part of this project, we used computational methods based on a deep learning framework to validate these findings by characterizing MNEG types and classifying them into either proteins coding RNAs (pcRNAs) or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Our results showed that the majority of MNEGs are classified as lncRNAs and further investigation suggested that some of them are circRNAs. Finally, this work provides an innovative approach and a unique computational framework to address the problem of incomplete HGA and could be adopted by the annotators in their pipelines. This study is an important step towards the completion and the improvement of the human genome annotation.},

@article{khan_comparative_2023,
 abstract = {Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) possess more than twenty carbon atoms and are the major components of seed storage oil, wax, and lipids. FAE (Fatty Acid Elongation) like genes take part in the biosynthesis of VLCFAs, growth regulation, and stress responses, and are further comprised of KCS (Ketoacyl-CoA synthase) and ELO (Elongation Defective Elongase) sub-gene families. The comparative genome-wide analysis and mode of evolution of KCS and ELO gene families have not been investigated in tetraploid Brassica carinata and its diploid progenitors. In this study, 53 KCS genes were identified in B. carinata compared to 32 and 33 KCS genes in B. nigra and B. oleracea respectively, which suggests that polyploidization might has impacted the fatty acid elongation process during Brassica evolution. Polyploidization has also increased the number of ELO genes in B. carinata (17) over its progenitors B. nigra (7) and B. oleracea (6). Based on comparative phylogenetics, KCS, and ELO proteins can be classified into eight and four major groups, respectively. The approximate date of divergence for duplicated KCS and ELO genes varied from 0.03 to 3.20 million years ago (MYA). Gene structure analysis indicated that the maximum number of genes were intron-less and remained conserved during evolution. The neutral type of selection seemed to be predominant in both KCS and ELO genes evolution. String-based protein-protein interaction analysis suggested that bZIP53, a transcription factor might be involved in the activation of transcription of ELO/KCS genes. The presence of biotic and abiotic stress-related cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region suggests that both KCS and ELO genes might also play their role in stress tolerance. The expression analysis of both gene family members reflect their preferential seed-specific expression, especially during the mature embryo development stage. Furthermore, some KCS and ELO genes were found to be specifically expressed under heat stress, phosphorus starvation, and Xanthomonas campestris infection. The current study provides a basis to understand the evolution of both KCS and ELO genes in fatty acid elongation and their role in stress tolerance.},

 abstract = {In this study, genomic and plasmid characteristics of Escherichia coli were determined with the aim of deducing how mcr genes may have spread on a colistin withdrawn pig farm. Whole genome hybrid sequencing was applied to six mcr-positive E. coli (MCRPE) strains isolated from pigs, a farmworker and wastewater collected between 2017 and 2019. Among these, mcr-1.1 genes were identified on IncI2 plasmids from a pig and wastewater, and on IncX4 from the human isolate, whereas mcr-3 genes were found on plasmids IncFII and IncHI2 in two porcine strains. The MCRPE isolates exhibited genotypic and phenotypic multidrug resistance (MDR) traits as well as heavy metal and antiseptic resistance genes. The mcr-1.1-IncI2 and IncX4 plasmids carried only colistin resistance genes. Whereas, the mcr-3.5-IncHI2 plasmid presented MDR region, with several mobile genetic elements. Despite the MCRPE strains belonged to different E. coli lineages, mcr-carrying plasmids with high similarities were found in isolates from pigs and wastewater recovered in different years. This study highlighted that several factors, including the resistomic profile of the host bacteria, co-selection via adjunct antibiotic resistance genes, antiseptics, and/or disinfectants, and plasmid-host fitness adaptation may encourage the maintenance of plasmids carrying mcr genes in E. coli.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide problem that imposes a devastating effect on developing countries and requires immediate interventions. Initially, most of the antibiotic drugs were identified by culturing soil microbes. However, this method is prone to discovering the same antibiotics repeatedly. The present study employed a shotgun metagenomics approach to investigate the taxonomic diversity, functional potential, and biosynthetic capacity of microbiomes from two natural agricultural farmlands located in Bekeka and Welmera Choke Kebelle in Ethiopia for the first time. Analysis of the small subunit rRNA revealed bacterial domain accounting for 83.33\% and 87.24\% in the two selected natural farmlands. Additionally, the analysis showed the dominance of Proteobacteria representing 27.27\% and 28.79\% followed by Actinobacteria making up 12.73\% and 13.64\% of the phyla composition. Furthermore, the analysis revealed the presence of unassigned bacteria in the studied samples. The metagenome functional analysis showed 176,961 and 104, 636 number of protein-coding sequences (pCDS) from the two samples found a match with 172,655 and 102, 275 numbers of InterPro entries, respectively. The Genome ontology annotation suggests the presence of 5517 and 3293 pCDS assigned to the “biosynthesis process”. Numerous Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes modules (KEGG modules) involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and polyketides were identified. Furthermore, both known and novel Biosynthetic gene clusters, responsible for the production of secondary metabolites, such as polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (Ripp), and Terpene, were discovered. Generally, from the results it can be concluded that the microbiomes in the selected sampling sites have a hidden functional potential for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Overall, this study can serve as a strong preliminary step in the long journey of bringing new antibiotics to the market.},

To phenocopy the disease in mice and gain insight into its mechanisms, we generated humanized transgenic mouse models. Expression of human BAG3P209L-eGFP in mice caused Z-disc disintegration and formation of protein aggregates. This was accompanied by massive fibrosis resulting in early-onset restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased mortality as observed in patients. RNA-Seq and proteomics revealed changes in the protein quality control system and increased autophagy in hearts from hBAG3P209L-eGFP mice. The mutation renders hBAG3P209L less soluble in vivo and induces protein aggregation, but does not abrogate hBAG3 binding properties. In conclusion, we report a mouse model mimicking the human disease. Our data suggest that the disease mechanism is due to accumulation of hBAG3P209L and mouse Bag3, causing sequestering of components of the protein quality control system and autophagy machinery leading to sarcomere disruption.},

In the present study we investigated its role in skin regeneration. We found that OLFM4 expression is transiently upregulated in the proliferative phase of cutaneous wound healing in humans as well as in mice. Moreover, a significant increase in OLFM4 expression was detected in the skin of lesional psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that OLFM4 selectively stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and increased both keratinocyte and fibroblast migration. Using proteotranscriptomic pathway analysis we revealed that transcription factors POU5F1/OCT4 and ESR1 acted as hubs for OLFM4-induced signalling in keratinocytes. In vivo experiments utilizing mouse splinted full-thickness cutaneous wound healing model showed that application of recombinant OLFM4 protein can significantly improve wound healing efficacy. Taken together, our results suggest that OLFM4 acts as a transiently upregulated inflammatory signal that promotes wound healing by regulating both dermal and epidermal cell compartments of the skin.},

It finds application in comparative and functional genomics, phylogenomics, and evolutionary reconstructions. With a rapidly increasing number of available genomes, the demand for large-scale predictions is also growing. In this contribution, we evaluate and implement major algorithmic improvements that significantly enhance the speed of the analysis without reducing precision. Graph-based detection of (co-)orthologs is typically based on a reciprocal best alignment heuristic that requires an all vs. all comparison of proteins from all species under study. The initial identification of similar proteins is accelerated by introducing an alternative search tool along with a revised search strategy—the pseudo-reciprocal best alignment heuristic—that reduces the number of required sequence comparisons by one-half.

 abstract = {WRKY transcription factors (TFs) play significant roles in plant development. However, they have not yet been studied in terms of the impact they have on the common fig (Ficus carica L.), a significant fruit species in Mediterranean countries. In this study, we extensively examined the full-genome F. carica WRKY (FcWRKYs) gene complement (47 genes), in terms of gene structure, protein domains and motifs, physicochemical properties, phylogenetic relationships and selection pressure. Based on the structural properties of the encoded proteins, we grouped the FcWRKY genes into three main groups (I, II and III), with the second group being further divided into five subgroups (a–e). Subgroup IId FcWRKY proteins were discovered to contain the Plant zinc cluster (Plant-zn-clust) domain and Ca2+-dependent Calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain (CaMBD). In total, we discovered ten conserved motifs, seven of which may be associated with WRKY functional specificities attributable to a single group or a small number of groups. Phylogenetically related members shared similar exon–intron structure, with the average number of exons being higher ({\textasciitilde} 5) in (sub)groups I, IIa, IIb compared to IIc, IId, IIe and III ({\textasciitilde} 3). Comparative phylogeny using the mulberry WRKY gene complement (MnWRKYs) revealed 38 pairs of orthologous genes shared by both species, which diverged from 84.3 to 25.3 million years ago (Mya) and have been evolving under purifying selection that was weaker on group III genes, suggesting an important role of this group in the enlargement of the adaptive array of WRKY TFs. RNA-seq results revealed that genes that were highly expressed in the peel across all fruit developmental stages belonged to group I and subgroups IIb, IIc, IId and IIe, suggesting the role played by these members in fruit peel development. RT-qPCR validated this profile and further showed that three genes FcWRKY25 (IIc), FcWRKY31 (IIb), and FcWRKY39 (IIc) are clearly more overexpressed during color acquisition in the Tunisian dark cultivar ‘Zidi’, in comparison with the light purple cultivar ‘Soltani’, presenting these three genes as potential contributors to the changes in biochemical compounds in the fig peel during fruit maturation. The knowledge framework provided by our study will be a valuable asset in the functional exploration of candidate genes that may be associated with fruit quality.},

 abstract = {MCM1-AGAMOUS-DEFICIENS-SRF (MADS)-box transcription factors (TFs) regulate a variety of plant developmental processes, particularly floral organ identity and fruit ripening. However, little is known about the MADS-box TF family in the common fig (Ficus carica L.), a vital fruit crop of Mediterranean countries. Here, we report a comprehensive overview of the MADS-box genes and their TF products in fig, describing their classification, physicochemical properties, protein and gene architectures, phylogenetic relationships, selection mode and differential expression during fruit development. A total of 64 MADS-box members were identified in F. carica and phylogenetically categorized as either type I (30) or type II (34). Type I MADS-box TFs were divided into three families (Mα, Mβ and Mγ, with 16, 4 and 10 members, respectively), whereas type II TFs were classified into two families (MIKCC and MIKC*, with 29 and 5 members, respectively). MIKCC TFs could be further classified into 12 subfamilies. Most FcMADS genes within the same clade were characterized by similar exon–intron organizations and motif compositions. Comparative phylogenetic analysis using mulberry (Morus notabilis) identified 24 (18 type II and 6 type I) orthologs between F. carica and M. notabilis. In addition, 11 paralogous MADS-box gene pairs were identified in F. carica, which evolved under purifying selection, except for two recent paralogs from the TM3 (SOC1) subfamily. RNA-seq results indicated that 28 and 34 FcMADS genes were differentially expressed in fruit peel and female flowers, respectively, during six successive stages of fruit development. According to their expression profiles, genes were grouped into four clusters (I, II, III and IV) in both tissues. FcMADS genes from fruit peel expression cluster IV (FcMADS13, -23, -32, -40 and -60) and female flower expression cluster III (FcMADS9, -49 and -58) were upregulated during fruit ripening in the corresponding tissues, suggesting a potential, tissue-specific role of these candidate genes in fruit ripening. Our findings provide the first genome-wide extended characterization of the MADS-box TF family in F. carica, laying the groundwork for future research on its molecular roles in fruit ripening.},

 abstract = {Protein expression is a primary area of interest for routine histological diagnostics and tissue-based research projects, but the limitations of its post-mortem applicability remain largely unclear. On the other hand, tissue specimens obtained during autopsies can provide unique insight into advanced disease states, especially in cancer research. Therefore, we aimed to identify the maximum post-mortem interval (PMI) which is still suitable for characterizing protein expression patterns, to explore organ-specific differences in protein degradation, and to investigate whether certain proteins follow specific degradation kinetics. Therefore, the proteome of human tissue samples obtained during routine autopsies of deceased patients with accurate PMI (6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96 h) and without specific diseases that significantly affect tissue preservation, from lungs, kidneys and livers, was analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). For the kidney and liver, significant protein degradation became apparent at 48 h. For the lung, the proteome composition was rather static for up to 48 h and substantial protein degradation was detected only at 72 h suggesting that degradation kinetics appear to be organ specific. More detailed analyses suggested that proteins with similar post-mortem kinetics are not primarily shared in their biological functions. The overrepresentation of protein families with analogous structural motifs in the kidney indicates that structural features may be a common factor in determining similar postmortem stability. Our study demonstrates that a longer post-mortem period may have a significant impact on proteome composition, but sampling within 24 h may be appropriate, as degradation is within acceptable limits even in organs with faster autolysis.},

 abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled with bottom-up mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics is a versatile technology for identifying and quantifying proteins in complex biological mixtures. Postidentification, analysis of changes in protein abundances between conditions requires increasingly complex and specialized statistical methods. Many of these methods, in particular the family of open-source Bioconductor packages MSstats, are implemented in a coding language such as R. To make the methods in MSstats accessible to users with limited programming and statistical background, we have created MSstatsShiny, an R-Shiny graphical user interface (GUI) integrated with MSstats, MSstatsTMT, and MSstatsPTM. The GUI provides a point and click analysis pipeline applicable to a wide variety of proteomics experimental types, including label-free data-dependent acquisitions (DDAs) or data-independent acquisitions (DIAs), or tandem mass tag (TMT)-based TMT-DDAs, answering questions such as relative changes in the abundance of peptides, proteins, or post-translational modifications (PTMs). To support reproducible research, the application saves user’s selections and builds an R script that programmatically recreates the analysis. MSstatsShiny can be installed locally via Github and Bioconductor, or utilized on the cloud at www.msstatsshiny.com. We illustrate the utility of the platform using two experimental data sets (MassIVE IDs MSV000086623 and MSV000085565).},

Cancer cells exhibiting higher sensitivity to austocystin D often display elevated CYP2J2 expression. However, the essentiality and the role of CYP2J2 for the cytotoxicity of this compound remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CYP2J2 depletion alleviates austocystin D sensitivity and DNA damage induction, while CYP2J2 overexpression enhances them. Moreover, the investigation into genes involved in austocystin D cytotoxicity identified POR and PGRMC1, positive regulators for CYP activity, and KAT7, a histone acetyltransferase. Through genetic manipulation and analysis of multiomics data, we elucidated a role for KAT7 in CYP2J2 transcriptional regulation. These findings strongly suggest that CYP2J2 is crucial for austocystin D metabolism and its subsequent cytotoxic effects. The potential use of austocystin D as a therapeutic prodrug is underscored, particularly in cancers where elevated CYP2J2 expression serves as a biomarker.},

@article{kolosov_malpighian_2019,
 abstract = {Skip to Next Section
The Malpighian tubules (MTs) and hindgut constitute the functional kidney of insects. MTs are outpouchings of the gut and in most insects demonstrate proximodistal heterogeneity in function. In most insects, such heterogeneity is confined to ion/fluid secretion in the distal portion and ion/fluid reabsorption in the proximal portion. In contrast, MTs of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars of butterflies and moths) are composed of five regions that differ in their association with the gut, their structure and ion/fluid transport function. Recent studies have shown that several regions can rapidly and reversibly switch between ion secretion and reabsorption. The present study employed RNAseq, pharmacology and electrophysiology to characterize four distinct regions of the MT in larval Trichoplusia ni. Luminal microelectrode measurements indicate changes in [K+], [Na+] and pH as fluid passes through different regions of the tubule. In addition, the regions examined differ in gene ontology enrichment, and demonstrate robust gradients in expression of ion transporters and endocrine ligand receptors. Lastly, the study provides evidence for direct involvement of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in epithelial ion transport of insect MTs.},

Albeit tissue-restricted expression patterns the two kinases share common functions; the most pronounced one being the phosphorylation of ITAM motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of antigenic receptors. Lck is predominantly expressed in T lymphocytes; however, it can be ectopically found in B-1 cell subsets and numerous pathologies including acute and chronic B-cell leukemias. The exact impact of Lck on the B-cell signaling apparatus remains enigmatic and is followed by the long-lasting question of mechanisms granting selectivity among SFK members. In this work we sought to investigate the mechanistic basis of ectopic Lck function in B-cells and compare it to events elicited by the predominant B-cell SFK, Lyn. Our results reveal substrate promiscuity displayed by the two SFKs, which however, is buffered by their differential susceptibility toward regulatory mechanisms, revealing a so far unappreciated aspect of SFK member-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, we show that Lck- and Lyn-generated signals suffice to induce transcriptome alterations, reminiscent of B-cell activation, in the absence of receptor/co-receptor engagement. Finally, our analyses revealed a yet unrecognized role of SFKs in tipping the balance of cellular stress responses, by promoting the onset of ER-phagy, an as yet completely uncharacterized process in B lymphocytes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{kramer_cyclic_2024,
 abstract = {In nature plants constantly experience changes in light intensities. Low illumination limits photosynthesis and growth. However, also high light intensities are a threat to plants as the photosynthetic machinery gets damaged when the incoming energy surpasses the capacity of photochemistry. One limitation of photochemistry is the constant resupply of stromal electron (e-) acceptors, mainly NADP. NADP is reduced at the acceptor-side of photosystem I. The resulting NADPH is utilized by the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle (CBBC) and the malate valve to ensure sufficient oxidized NADP ready to accept e- from PSI. Lately, additional pathways, which function as stromal e- sinks under abiotic stress conditions, were discovered. One such reaction in Arabidopsis thaliana is catalyzed by PHOSPHOGLYCERATE DEHYDROGENASE 3 (PGDH3), which diverts e- from the CBBC into NADH. pgdh3 loss-of-function mutants exhibit elevated non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and fluctuating light susceptibility. To optimize plant photosynthesis in challenging environments knowledge on PGDH3’s metabolic integration is needed. We used the source of high NPQ in pgdh3 as a starting point. Our study reveals that increased NPQ originates from high cyclic electron flow (CEF). Interestingly, PGDH3 function seems very important when the CEF-generator PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5) is lost. Consequently, pgr5pgdh3 double mutants are more sensitive to fluctuating light.},

 abstract = {Neurological diseases can lead to the denervation of brain regions caused by demyelination, traumatic injury or cell death. The molecular and structural mechanisms underlying lesion-induced reorganization of denervated brain regions, however, are a matter of ongoing investigation. In order to address this issue, we performed an entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL) in mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures of both sexes and studied denervation-induced plasticity of mossy fiber synapses, which connect dentate granule cells (dGCs) with CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) and play important roles in learning and memory formation. Partial denervation caused a strengthening of excitatory neurotransmission in dGCs, CA3-PCs and their direct synaptic connections, as revealed by paired recordings (dGC-to-CA3-PC). These functional changes were accompanied by ultrastructural reorganization of mossy fiber synapses, which regularly contain the plasticity-regulating protein synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle. We demonstrate that the spine apparatus organelle and synaptopodin are related to ribosomes in close proximity to synaptic sites and reveal a synaptopodin-related transcriptome. Notably, synaptopodin-deficient tissue preparations that lack the spine apparatus organelle failed to express lesion-induced synaptic adjustments. Hence, synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle play a crucial role in regulating lesion-induced synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.},

Using a JupyterLab notebook, long-running AI model training programs can also be executed remotely to create trained models, represented in open neural network exchange (ONNX) format, and other output datasets in Galaxy. Other features include Git integration for version control, the option of creating and executing pipelines of notebooks, and multiple dashboards and packages for monitoring compute resources and visualization, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These features make JupyterLab in Galaxy Europe highly suitable for creating and managing AI projects. A recent scientific publication that predicts infected regions in COVID-19 computed tomography scan images is reproduced using various features of JupyterLab on Galaxy Europe. In addition, ColabFold, a faster implementation of AlphaFold2, is accessed in JupyterLab to predict the 3-dimensional structure of protein sequences. JupyterLab is accessible in 2 ways-one as an interactive Galaxy tool and the other by running the underlying Docker container. In both ways, long-running training can be executed on Galaxy's compute infrastructure. Scripts to create the Docker container are available under MIT license at https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gpu-jupyterlab-docker.},

In this study, we have explored the available human gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequence datasets of cohorts representing large geographical gradients. The 16S rRNA sequences representing V3-V4 as well as V4 regions generated using Illumina sequencing chemistry in the MiSeq platform encompassing the United States of America, Chile, South Africa, Kuwait, and Malaysia were subjected to in-depth computational biology analyses. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most dominant phyla present in all studied cohorts but Actinobacteria was exclusively present in high abundance in cohorts from Malaysia (15.99\%). The relative abundance of five families, namely Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Eubacteriaceae were highest representing the studied cohorts. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that the dissimilarity in the gut microbiome structure of cohorts representing studied countries was significant (R2 = 0.28, P {\textless} 0.001). The calculated Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F : B) ratio was found to be lowest in cohorts from South Africa (1.11) and Chile (0.95). The cohorts from South Africa exhibited the highest alpha diversity based on Hill numbers at q=0, whereas at q=1 and 2, cohorts from Malaysia had the highest alpha diversity. The beta diversity analysis revealed that cohorts from Chile formed a distinct cluster among all the studied geographical locations. For the first time, the study also showed that cohorts from Malaysia representing short geographical distances exhibited distinct intrapopulation differences in the gut microbiome and may not be influenced by cultural and genetic factors.},

 abstract = {Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) group proteins regulate various developmental processes in plants by repressing target genes via H3K27 trimethylation, and they function antagonistically with H3K4 trimethylation mediated by Trithorax group proteins. Tuberization in potato has been widely studied, but the role of histone modifications in this process is unknown. Recently, we showed that overexpression of StMSI1, a PRC2 member, alters the expression of tuberization genes in potato. As MSI1 lacks histone-modification activity, we hypothesized that this altered expression could be caused by another PRC2 member, StE(z)2, a potential H3K27 methyltransferase in potato. Here, we demonstrate that a short-day photoperiod influences StE(z)2 expression in the leaves and stolons. StE(z)2 overexpression alters plant architecture and reduces tuber yield, whereas its knockdown enhances yield. ChIP-sequencing using stolons induced by short-days indicated that several genes related to tuberization and phytohormones, such as StBEL5/11/29, StSWEET11B, StGA2OX1, and StPIN1 carry H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 marks and/or are StE(z)2 targets. Interestingly, we observed that another important tuberization gene, StSP6A, is targeted by StE(z)2 in leaves and that it has increased deposition of H3K27me3 under long-day (non-induced) conditions compared to short days. Overall, our results show that StE(z)2 and deposition of H3K27me3 and/or H3K4me3 marks might regulate the expression of key tuberization genes in potato.},

Proteo-transcriptomic analysis compares the relative abundance levels of transcripts and their corresponding proteins, illuminating discordant gene product responses to perturbations. These results reveal potential post-transcriptional regulation, providing researchers with important new insights into underlying biological and pathological disease mechanisms. To carry out proteo-transcriptomic analysis, researchers require software that statistically determines transcript–protein abundance correlation levels and provides results visualization and interpretation functionality, ideally within a flexible, user-friendly platform. As a solution, we have developed the QuanTP software within the Galaxy platform. The software offers a suite of tools and functionalities critical for proteo-transcriptomics, including statistical algorithms for assessing the correlation between single transcript–protein pairs as well as across two cohorts, outlier identification and clustering, along with a diverse set of results visualizations. It is compatible with analyses of results from single experiment data or from a two-cohort comparison of aggregated replicate experiments. The tool is available in the Galaxy Tool Shed through a cloud-based instance and a Docker container. In all, QuanTP provides an accessible and effective software resource, which should enable new multiomic discoveries from quantitative proteo-transcriptomic data sets.},

Hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. Mean accuracy of 98\% in recommending tools is achieved for the top-1 metric.The model is accessed by a Galaxy API to provide researchers with recommended tools in an interactive manner using multiple user interface integrations on the European Galaxy server. High-quality and highly used tools are shown at the top of the recommendations.

 abstract = {In the present study, we report the draft genome of soil isolate DP-K7 that has the potential to degrade methyl red. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome analysis exposed that the bacterial strain DP-K7 belongs to the species Kocuria indica. The genome annotation of the strain DP-K7 through the bioinformatics tool “Prokka” showed that the genome contains 3,010,594 bp with 69.01\% GC content. The genome comprises 57 contigs including 2 rRNA genes, 47 tRNA genes, and 2754 CDS. The plate and broth assay showed that the strain DP-K7 has the potential to utilize methyl red as the sole carbon source for growth. Indeed, the RP-HPLC analysis proved that the strain DP-K7 is capable of degrading methyl red. The genome BLAST against a characterized azoreductase (AzoB—Xenophilus azovorans KF46F) revealed the presence of two azoreductase-like genes (azoKi-1 and azoKi-2). The phylogenetic analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of characterized azoreductases suggested that AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 belong to members of the clade IV azoreductase, which are flavin-independent. The multiple sequence alignment of AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 with flavin-independent azoreductases showed the presence of NAD(P)H binding like motif (GxxGxxG). In addition, other genes coding for dye degrading enzymes (SodC, SodA, KatA, KatE, and DyP2) were also found in the genome supporting that the strain K. indica DP-K7 is a potential azo dye degrader.},

 abstract = {Knowledge of variability in phenological traits is of utmost importance in breeding new almond cultivars in the context of impending climate change. The Northwestern Himalayan region is characterized by extreme winters, and phenological studies of fruit crops in relation to environmental variables in this region are scant. Flowering time being an important trait governing agricultural productivity, the objectives of this study were the evaluation of local and exotic almond cultivars for blooming initiation and other associated parameters. This study also aimed at deciphering the association between bloom dates in almonds and prevailing temperatures. Field phenological observations were performed during seven growing seasons (2012–2018) in Kashmir. Phenological traits like endodormancy breaking were estimated using the correlation model. The heat requirements for blooming were estimated using the growing degree days (GDD) method. The association between average temperatures and days to flowering was studied using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Local cultivars ‘Makhdoom’ and ‘Shalimar’ were earliest to bloom within 80 days, while the exotic cultivars were late bloomers, requiring 87 days. Cultivars ‘Makhdoom’, ‘Shalimar’, ‘Drake’ and ‘Pranyaj’ broke their endodormancy on the same date, i.e. December 26, although another group including ‘Waris’, ‘California Paper Shell’ and ‘Merced’ exhibited endo- to ecodormancy transition on January 21. In general, Himalayan-origin almond cultivars revealed low heat requirements for flowering compared to the exotic ones. PLS regression analysis identified four major periods in which average temperatures successfully explained variation in days to blooming in almonds. In conclusion, a phenological prediction model is presented here that explains variation in blooming dates in almond cultivars as a function of average temperatures. This model addresses the almond cultivars growing in the Himalayan region and is expected to be of great practical utility to the farming community to efficiently plan their orchard management practices.},

@article{lacerda_effect_2025,
 abstract = {Survival of brachyuran crabs is temperature-dependent and thermal stress promotes changes during molting. We aimed to decipher the impact of thermal stresses on the X-organ/sinus gland (XO/SG) complex, a temperature-sensitive neuroendocrine tissue involved in the molting regulation of Callinectes sapidus during the intermolt and premolt phases. We employed a proteogenomic approach using specimens subjected to control (24 °C), cold (19 °C), and heat (29 °C) temperatures. A total of 1463 protein groups with at least two unique peptides were identified and quantified. C. sapidus in the premolt stage exposed to the cold condition exhibited a proteome closely resembling that of the intermolt stage, as evidenced by measurements of circulating ecdysteroid levels. Compared to the intermolt at control temperature, the premolt stage exhibited increased energy metabolism, structural changes in the cuticle mediated by chitin metabolism and glycoproteins, biosynthesis of methyl farnesoate (MF), and elevated tissue levels of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), indicating lower secretion rates. Heat temperature (29 °C) seems to induce mitochondrial metabolism in the intermolt XO/SG, while cold temperature elicited a delayed molt cycle in the premolt phase, marked by reduced tissue levels of CHH, indicating increased secretion and Y-organ (YO) inhibition, and decreased MF production (reduced YO stimulation).
Significance statement
Temperature plays a pivotal role in regulating the metabolism, growth, molting, reproduction, and survival of crabs, such as the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Despite the blue crab's significance on both economic and ecological realms, there has been a notable lack of molecular information related to this species and therefore a gap in our knowledge of the blue crab's molecular makeup and genetic diversity. This research established a comprehensive proteome landscape to elucidate the molecular and functional changes in the XO/SG complex involved in the molting process of C. sapidus, and how thermal stresses significantly influence biotransformation processes. Utilizing a proteogenomics approach with multi-round homologous database analysis, we have generated a highly accurate protein repertoire with at least two unique peptide of XO/SG tissue proteome. This resource will be invaluable for future molecular analyses of this species. Our findings demonstrate that thermal stresses induced specific modifications in the XO/SG tissue, depending on the molt cycle phase. Temperature-mediated responses influences the biological processes, enhancing the functional morphogenesis and comprehensive metabolic adaptations on molting cycle supported by a relationship between the XO/SG tissue proteome and circulating ecdysteroid levels.},

 abstract = {The sRNA Yfr1 and members of the Yfr2 sRNA family are almost universally present within cyanobacteria. The conserved motifs of these sRNAs are nearly complementary to each other, suggesting their ability to participate in crosstalk. The conserved motif of Yfr1 is shared by members of the Yfr10 sRNA family, members of which are otherwise less conserved in sequence, structure, and synteny compared to Yfr1. The different structural properties enable the discrimination of unique targets of Yfr1 and Yfr10. Unlike most studied regulatory sRNAs, Yfr1 gene expression only slightly changes under the tested stress conditions and is present at high levels at all times. In contrast, cellular levels of Yfr10 increase during the course of acclimation to darkness, and levels of Yfr2 increase when cells are shifted to high light or nitrogen limitation conditions. In this study, we investigated the targetomes of Yfr2, Yfr1, and Yfr10 in Prochlorococcus MED4, establishing CRAFD-Seq as a new method for identifying direct targets of these sRNAs that is applicable to all bacteria, including those that are not amenable to genetic modification. The results suggest that these sRNAs are integrated within a regulatory network of unprecedented complexity in the adjustment of carbon and nitrogen-related primary metabolism.},

 abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other auxiliary proteins for cell entry. Recent studies have described conjunctival congestion in 0.8\% of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and there has been speculation that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the conjunctiva. However, it is currently unclear whether conjunctival epithelial cells express ACE2 and its cofactors. In this study, a total of 38 conjunctival samples from 38 patients, including 12 healthy conjunctiva, 12 melanoma, 7 squamous cell carcinoma and 7 papilloma samples, were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mRNA expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and its cofactors including TMPRSS2, ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. ACE2 protein expression was assessed in eight healthy conjunctival samples using immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is not substantially expressed in conjunctival samples on the mRNA (median 0.0 transcripts per million (TPM), min 0.0 TPM, max 1.7 TPM) and protein levels. Similar results were obtained for the transcription of other auxiliary molecules. In conclusion, this study finds no evidence for a significant expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary mediators for cell entry in conjunctival samples, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV-2 via these mediators unlikely.

 abstract = {Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are rRNA N-glycosylases (EC 3.2.2.22) that depurinate an adenine residue from the conserved alpha-sarcin/ricin loop in rRNA, blocking protein synthesis. In previous research, we demonstrated that whiteflies from the Aleyrodidae family (e.g., Bemisia tabaci), mosquitoes from the Culicinae subfamily (e.g., Aedes aegypti), and flies of Sciaroidea superfamily (e.g., Contarinia nasturtii) acquired these genes via three independent horizontal gene transfer events. The temporal expression profiles analyzed in mosquitoes and flies are consistent with the expected for immune effector molecules of insects. Notably, in A. aegypti, we found that these genes contribute to immunity. In whiteflies, codon analysis suggests that RIP genes have evolved under the influence of natural selection. Public transcriptomic experiments have shown that these genes are expressed in the adult stage of B. tabaci. Despite computational findings supporting RIP genes functionality in whiteflies, no experimental studies have been conducted. Furthermore, there is currently no publicly available RNA-seq data evaluating gene expression throughout ontogeny in the Aleyrodidae family. In this work, we experimentally demonstrated the presence of these foreign genes in the genome of Trialeurodes vaporariorum. We quantified their expression across the life cycle stages of this species and analyzed their untranslated regions. The results obtained contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological roles that these ribotoxin encoding genes may play in whiteflies and other insects.},

Previously, we reported the existence of these toxins in insects, whose presence is restricted to mosquitoes from the Culicinae subfamily (e.g., Aedes aegypti) and whiteflies from the Aleyrodidae family (e.g., Bemisia tabaci). Both groups of genes are derived from two independent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events and are evolving under purifying selection. Here, we report and characterize the occurrence of a third HGT event in the Sciaroidea superfamily, which supports the recurrent acquisition of RIP genes by insects. Transcriptomic experiments, available in databases, allowed us to describe the temporal and spatial expression profiles for these foreign genes in these organisms. Furthermore, we found that RIP expression is induced after infection with pathogens and provided, for the first time, transcriptomic evidence of parasite SRL depurination. This evidence suggests a possible role of these foreign genes as immune effectors in insects.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE Corneal infections are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. Here we applied high-resolution transcriptomic profiling to assess the general and pathogen-specific molecular and cellular mechanisms during human corneal infection. METHODS Clinical diagnoses of herpes simplex virus (HSV) (n=5) and bacterial/fungal (n=5) keratitis were confirmed by histology. Healthy corneas (n=7) and keratoconus (n=4) samples served as controls. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human corneal specimens were analyzed using the 3' RNA sequencing method Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE RNA-seq). The cellular host response was investigated using comprehensive bioinformatic deconvolution (xCell and CYBERSORTx) analyses and by integration with published single cell RNA-seq data of the human cornea. RESULTS Our analysis identified 216 and 561 genes, that were specifically overexpressed in viral or bacterial/fungal keratitis, respectively, and allowed to distinguish the two etiologies. The virus-specific host response was driven by adaptive immunity and associated molecular signaling pathways, whereas the bacterial/fungal-specific host response mainly involved innate immunity signaling pathways and cell types. We identified several genes and pathways involved in the host response to infectious keratitis, including CXCL9, CXCR3, and MMP9 for viral, and S100A8/A9, MMP9, and the IL17 pathway for bacterial/fungal keratitis. CONCLUSIONS High-resolution molecular profiling provides new insights into the human corneal host response to viral and bacterial/fungal infection. Pathogen-specific molecular profiles may provide the foundation for novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic approaches that target inflammation-induced damage to corneal host cells with the goal to improve the outcome of infectious keratitis.},

 abstract = {C-type lectin-like domain containing proteins (CTLDcps) mainly bind carbohydrate-based ligands, but also other ligands. CTLDcps are involved in several biological processes including cell adhesion, cell-cell interactions, and pathogen recognition. Pathogen recognition by myeloid cells, e.g. dendritic cells (DCs), can be facilitated through cell surface expressed CTLDcps. Cell surface expressed CTLDcps have been exploited in vaccine designs for specific targeting of human and mouse DCs using antibodies. In recent years, however, DC targeting using carbohydrate-based vaccines has gained interest due to low production cost, limited immunogenicity, and possibility of multivalent adjustment. In chicken, however, only a few CTLDcps have been identified. Identifying and annotating additional chicken CTLDcps (chCTLDcps) is needed to exploit carbohydrate-mediated DC targeting in chicken. Therefore, we searched the chicken GRCg6a assembly for novel chCTLDcps. We identified 28 chCTLDcps of which 10 had previously been described and also experimentally validated. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR confirmed mRNA expression of the remaining 18 identified chCTLDcps. A group of highly related chCTLDcps, moreover, was shown to be avian-specific and comprise novel members mapped to the proposed chicken natural killer gene complex. Two chCTLDcps, chCLEC17AL-A and chCLEC17AL-B, were found to share a recent common ancestor with CLEC17A. Putative mannose or fucose-binding sequence motifs, EPN and WND, were found in the CTLD of chCLEC17AL-A. Both contained intracellular internalisation and signalling sequence motifs. In conclusion, several chCTLDcps were identified and their expression confirmed. Both chCLEC17AL-A and -B showed promise as potential targets in carbohydrate-based chicken vaccine strategies. Determination of DC-specific expression of chCLEC17AL-A and -B, thus, might prove useful in chicken vaccinology.},

 abstract = {Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and several genetic events have been described to promote the development of thyroid carcinogenesis. Besides the effects of specific mutations on thyroid cancer development, the molecular mechanisms controlling tumorigenesis, tumor behavior, and drug resistance are still largely unknown. Cancer organoids have been proposed as a powerful tool to study aspects related to tumor development and progression and appear promising to test individual responses to therapies. Here, using mESC-derived thyroid organoids, we developed a BrafV637E-inducible model able to recapitulate the features of papillary thyroid cancer in vitro. Overexpression of the murine BrafV637E mutation, equivalent to BrafV600E in humans, rapidly triggers to MAPK activation, cell dedifferentiation, and disruption of follicular organization. BrafV637E-expressing organoids show a transcriptomic signature for p53, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interactions, EMT, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Finally, PTC-like thyroid organoids were used for drug screening assays. The combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors reversed BrafV637E oncogene-promoted cell dedifferentiation while restoring thyroid follicle organization and function in vitro. Our results demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells-derived thyroid cancer organoids can mimic tumor development and features while providing an efficient tool for testing novel targeted therapies.},

 abstract = {Background: Traditional omic analysis relies on p-value and fold change as selection criteria. There is an ongoing debate on their effectiveness in delivering systemic and robust interpretation, due to their dependence on assumptions of conformity with various parametric distributions.Here, we propose a threshold-free selection method based on robust, non-parametric statistics, ensuring independence from the statistical distribution properties and broad applicability. Such methods could adapt to different initial data distributions, contrary to statistical techniques based on fixed thresholds. Methods: Our work extends the Rank Products methodology with a neutral selection method of high information-extraction capacity. We introduce the calculation of the RP distribution\&rsquo;s entropy to isolate the features of interest by their contribution to the distribution\&rsquo;s information content. The aim is a methodology performing threshold-free identification of the differentially expressed features, which are highly informative about the phenomenon under scrutiny. Conclusions: Applying the proposed method on microarray (transcriptomic and DNA methylation) and RNAseq count data of varying sizes and noise presence, we observe robust convergence for the different parameterisations to stable cutoff points. Functional analysis through BioInfoMiner and EnrichR was used to evaluate the information potency of the resulting feature lists. Overall, the derived functional terms provide a systemic description highly compatible with the results of traditional statistical hypothesis testing techniques. The methodology behaves consistently across different data types. The feature lists are compact and information-rich, indicating phenotypic aspects specific to the tissue and biological phenomenon i nvestigated. Selection by information content measures efficiently addresses problems, emerging from arbitrary thresholding, thus facilitating the full automation of the analysis.},

@article{latif_nfatc1_2022,
 abstract = {Objectives Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can persist in the stage of simple hepatic steatosis or progress to steatohepatitis (NASH) with an increased risk for cirrhosis and cancer. We examined the mechanisms controlling the progression to severe NASH in order to develop future treatment strategies for this disease.
Design NFATc1 activation and regulation was examined in livers from patients with NAFLD, cultured and primary hepatocytes and in transgenic mice with differential hepatocyte-specific expression of the transcription factor (Alb-cre, NFATc1c.a. and NFATc1Δ/Δ). Animals were fed with high-fat western diet (WD) alone or in combination with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD treatment. NFATc1-dependent ER stress-responses, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and disease progression were assessed both in vitro and in vivo.
Results NFATc1 expression was weak in healthy livers but strongly induced in advanced NAFLD stages, where it correlates with liver enzyme values as well as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, high-fat WD increased NFATc1 expression, nuclear localisation and activation to promote NAFLD progression, whereas hepatocyte-specific depletion of the transcription factor can prevent mice from disease acceleration. Mechanistically, NFATc1 drives liver cell damage and inflammation through ER stress sensing and activation of the PERK-CHOP unfolded protein response (UPR). Finally, NFATc1-induced disease progression towards NASH can be blocked by TUDCA administration.
Conclusion NFATc1 stimulates NAFLD progression through chronic ER stress sensing and subsequent activation of terminal UPR signalling in hepatocytes. Interfering with ER stress-responses, for example, by TUDCA, protects fatty livers from progression towards manifest NASH.},

 abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signaling molecule that participates in various signaling functions in health and diseases. The tetrameric cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) contributes to H2S biogenesis and several investigations provide evidence on the pharmacological modulation of CSE as a potential target for the treatment of a multitude of conditions. D-penicillamine (D-pen) has recently been reported to selectively impede CSE-catalyzed H2S production but the molecular bases for such inhibitory effect have not been investigated. In this study, we report that D-pen follows a mixed-inhibition mechanism to inhibit both cystathionine (CST) cleavage and H2S biogenesis by human CSE. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying such a mixed inhibition, we performed docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Interestingly, MD analysis of CST binding reveals a likely active site configuration prior to gem-diamine intermediate formation, particularly H-bond formation between the amino group of the substrate and the O3′ of PLP. Similar analyses realized with both CST and D-pen identified three potent interfacial ligand-binding sites for D-pen and offered a rational for D-pen effect. Thus, inhibitor binding not only induces the creation of an entirely new interacting network at the vicinity of the interface between enzyme subunits, but it also exerts long range effects by propagating to the active site. Overall, our study paves the way for the design of new allosteric interfacial inhibitory compounds that will specifically modulate H2S biogenesis by cystathionine γ-lyase.},

 abstract = {Purpose
Tumor hypoxia is a major cause of treatment resistance, especially to radiation therapy at conventional dose rate (CONV), and we wanted to assess whether hypoxia does alter tumor sensitivity to FLASH.
Methods and Materials
We engrafted several tumor types (glioblastoma [GBM], head and neck cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma) subcutaneously in mice to provide a reliable and rigorous way to modulate oxygen supply via vascular clamping or carbogen breathing. We irradiated tumors using a single 20-Gy fraction at either CONV or FLASH, measured oxygen tension, monitored tumor growth, and sampled tumors for bulk RNAseq and pimonidazole analysis. Next, we inhibited glycolysis with trametinib in GBM tumors to enhance FLASH efficacy.
Results
Using various subcutaneous tumor models, and in contrast to CONV, FLASH retained antitumor efficacy under acute hypoxia. These findings show that in addition to normal tissue sparing, FLASH could overcome hypoxia-mediated tumor resistance. Follow-up molecular analysis using RNAseq profiling uncovered a FLASH-specific profile in human GBM that involved cell-cycle arrest, decreased ribosomal biogenesis, and a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Glycolysis inhibition by trametinib enhanced FLASH efficacy in both normal and clamped conditions.
Conclusions
These data provide new and specific insights showing the efficacy of FLASH in a radiation-resistant context, proving an additional benefit of FLASH over CONV.},

Variants of concern (VOCs) declared by the World Health Organization require continuous monitoring because of their possible changes in transmissibility, virulence, and antigenicity. The Omicron variant, a VOC, has become the dominant variant worldwide since November 2021. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly after the detection of Omicron VOC on November 24, 2021. In this study, we estimated the underlying epidemiological processes of Omicron VOC in South Korea using time-scaled phylodynamic analysis. Three distinct phylogenetic subgroups (Kor-O1, Kor-O2, and Kor-O3) were detected in South Korea. The Kor-O1 subgroup circulated in the Daegu region, whereas Kor-O2 and Kor-O3 circulated in Incheon and Jeollanam-do, respectively. The viral population size and case number of the Kor-O1 subgroup increased more rapidly than those of the other subgroups, indicating the rapid spread of the virus. The results indicated the multiple introductions of Omicron sub-lineages into South Korea and their subsequent co-circulation. The evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be continuously monitored, and control strategies need to be improved to control the multiple variants.},

 abstract = {Ciliates assemble numerous microtubular structures into complex cortical patterns. During ciliate division, the pattern is duplicated by intracellular segmentation that produces a tandem of daughter cells. In Tetrahymena thermophila, the induction and positioning of the division boundary involves two mutually antagonistic factors: posterior CdaA (cyclin E) and anterior CdaI (Hippo kinase). Here, we characterized the related cdaH-1 allele, which confers a pleiotropic patterning phenotype including an absence of the division boundary and an anterior–posterior mispositioning of the new oral apparatus. CdaH is a Fused or Stk36 kinase ortholog that localizes to multiple sites that correlate with the effects of its loss, including the division boundary and the new oral apparatus. CdaH acts downstream of CdaA to induce the division boundary and drives asymmetric cytokinesis at the tip of the posterior daughter. CdaH both maintains the anterior–posterior position of the new oral apparatus and interacts with CdaI to pattern ciliary rows within the oral apparatus. Thus, CdaH acts at multiple scales, from induction and positioning of structures on the cell-wide polarity axis to local organelle-level patterning.},

Hence the usefulness of samples with substandard DNA quality for LRS is unknown. We aim to perform de-novo assembly of Adenovirus sequenced from non-human primate (NHP) faeces using the Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT), an LRS platform. Guided by initial conventional PCR screening, we performed ONT sequencing on 34 Adenovirus positive DNA samples, without prior selection based on faeces freshness level or DNA quality. Non-parametric correlation analysis showed that ONT sequencing outputs is not significantly associated (p {\textgreater} 0.05) with DNA concentrations, faeces freshness levels and the OD ratios of A260/A280 and A260/A230. This indicated that conventional DNA quality parameters may not be the most critical factors in determining the suitability of samples for ONT sequencing. A total of 61.76 \% (21/34) of the positive-by-PCR-screening samples yielded Adenovirus reads while 38.24 \% (13/34) did not in the PCR-free ONT workflow, although rarefaction analysis showed that sequencing saturation was achieved by all samples. Among the 21 samples with adenovirus reads, ten resulted in at least one Adenovirus contig by the Flye assembler while nine did not and two samples had only a single Adenovirus read. Identity similarity above 90 \% in conventional PCR screening may help in selecting ONT positive samples.},

@phdthesis{lehmann_immunoregulatory_2023,
 abstract = {The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is the causative agent of the potentially life-threatening Chagas disease and leads to lifelong infection. During the infection, T. cruzi-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are necessary for long-term reduction of parasite burden and inflammation. However, in humans with Chagas disease, CD8+ T cells progressively lose function, characterised by decreased cytokine production, advanced differentiation, and increased expression of co-inhibitory receptors. Nevertheless, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, are present throughout the infection, which are mainly secreted by T cells and NK cells. One of the key features of T. cruzi is a chronic infection over the whole lifespan of the host. Especially skeletal muscle cells, were shown to be persistently infected in mice models.  
Here, strong evidence is presented that skeletal muscle cells provide a unique niche for T. cruzi by inhibiting clearance of the parasite by CD8+ T cells, thereby allowing the parasite to persist in the body. It could be shown that muscle cells actively shape the immune response. Infected primary human skeletal muscle cells produce immune-recruiting chemokines and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 and CCL-19. Furthermore, co-inhibitory receptor ligands, such as PD-L1, PD-L2, galectin-9, HVEM, CD155 and CD122 were expressed by the muscle cells upon stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines and infection with T. cruzi. While, the soluble forms of the ligands PD-L1, PD-L2 and galectin-9 are simultaneously found in the supernatant of muscle cell cultures. Proliferation-analysis of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells revealed suppressive capacity of T. cruzi-infected muscle cells in a PD-1 and TIM-3-dependent manner. In line, stimulation of the muscle cells with IFN-γ prior to the co-culture resulted in even higher suppression capacity. High levels of galectin-9 are present in the serum of Chagas patients, indicating a potential systemic inhibition of T cell function. Moreover, the secretion of the IL4-I1 enzyme by muscle cells could be demonstrated. This molecule can upregulate co-inhibitory receptor ligands on T cells, reduce T cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Thus, IL4-I1 might represent a promising new candidate whose immunoregulatory role during T. cruzi infection needs to be further investigated. In conclusion, multiple mechanisms by which muscle cells can regulate the immune cell response are presented here and indicate that blocking only one of those mechanisms might not be sufficient to augment T cell activity.  
Moreover, it was revealed that muscle cells sense the infection with T. cruzi and induce anti-parasitic mechanisms, like the induction of iNOS. This mechanism is capable of significantly reducing the parasite load in muscle cells. The pro-inflammatory environment plays an ambiguous role in the muscle during T. cruzi infection by inducing anti-parasitic mechanisms, thereby reducing parasite burden and at the same time inducing immune regulatory mechanisms, which down-regulate the T cell response. Together, these mechanisms might be essential to ensure limited tissue damage and parasite persistence. Thus, muscle cells prove to be crucial modulators of immune cells during T. cruzi infection.},

 abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with compositional and functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, but specific contributions of individual bacteria to chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear. Enterococcus faecalis is a resident member of the human intestinal core microbiota that has been linked to the pathogenesis of IBD and induces chronic colitis in susceptible monoassociated IL-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of E. faecalis as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of E. faecalis isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10-/- mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the ethanolamine utilization (eut) locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of eut genes, deletion of ethanolamine utilization (∆eutVW) had no impact on E. faecalis colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10-/- mice. However, replacement of the E. faecalis wild type bacteria by a ∆eutVW mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10-/- mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of E. faecalis ethanolamine utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand E. faecalis gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type E. faecalis cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10-/- mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms E. faecalis gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in E. faecalis monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of E. faecalis genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking E. faecalis enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that E. faecalis ethanolamine metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis towards a protective function.},

 abstract = {High tissue density of the mammary gland is considered a pro-tumorigenic factor, hence suppressing the stimuli that induce matrix buildup carries the potential for cancer interception. We found that in non-malignant mammary epithelial cells the combination of the chemopreventive agents bexarotene (Bex) and carvedilol (Carv) suppresses the zymogen granule protein 16B (ZG16B, PAUF) through an interaction of ARID1A with a proximal enhancer. Bex + Carv also reduced ZG16B levels in vivo in normal breast tissue and MDA-MB231 tumor xenografts. The relevance of ZG16B is underscored by ongoing clinical trials targeting ZG16B in pancreatic cancers, but its role in breast cancer development is unclear. In immortalized mammary epithelial cells, secreted recombinant ZG16B stimulated mitogenic kinase phosphorylation, detachment and mesenchymal characteristics, and promoted proliferation, motility and clonogenic growth. Highly concerted induction of specific laminin, collagen and integrin isoforms indicated a shift in matrix properties toward increased density and cell-matrix interactions. Exogenous ZG16B alone blocked Bex + Carv-mediated control of cell growth and migration, and antagonized Bex + Carv-induced gene programs regulating cell adhesion and migration. In breast cancer cells ZG16B induced colony formation and anchorage-independent growth, and stimulated migration in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. In contrast, Bex + Carv inhibited colony formation, reduced Ki67 levels, ZG16B expression and glucose uptake in MDA-MB231 xenografts. These data establish ZG16B as a druggable pro-tumorigenic target in breast cell transformation and suggest a key role of the matrisome network in rexinoid-dependent antitumor activity.},

 abstract = {The perforant path provides the primary cortical excitatory input to the hippocampus. Because of its important role in information processing and coding, entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus have been studied in considerable detail. Nevertheless, synaptic transmission between individual connected pairs of entorhinal stellate cells and dentate granule cells remains to be characterized. Here, we have used mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures of either sex, in which the entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate granule cell (GC; EC–GC) projection is present, and EC–GC pairs can be studied using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. By using cultures of wild-type mice, the properties of EC–GC synapses formed by afferents from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex were compared, and differences in short-term plasticity were identified. As the perforant path is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease, we used tissue cultures of amyloid precursor protein (APP)–deficient mice to examine the role of APP at this synapse. APP deficiency altered excitatory neurotransmission at medial perforant path synapses, which was accompanied by transcriptomic and ultrastructural changes. Moreover, presynaptic but not postsynaptic APP deletion through the local injection of Cre-expressing adeno-associated viruses in conditional APPflox/flox tissue cultures increased the neurotransmission efficacy at perforant path synapses. In summary, these data suggest a physiological role for presynaptic APP at medial perforant path synapses that may be adversely affected under altered APP processing conditions.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The hippocampus receives input from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. These projections to hippocampal dentate granule cells are of utmost importance for learning and memory formation. Although there is detailed knowledge about perforant path projections, the functional synaptic properties at the level of individual connected pairs of neurons are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of APP in mediating functional properties and transmission rules in individually connected neurons using paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and genetic tools in organotypic tissue cultures. Our results show that presynaptic APP expression limits excitatory neurotransmission via the perforant path, which could be compromised in pathologic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.},

 abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity is crucial for elucidating how the brain adapts to internal and external stimuli. A key objective of plasticity is maintaining physiological activity states during perturbations by adjusting synaptic transmission through negative feedback mechanisms. However, identifying and characterizing novel molecular targets orchestrating synaptic plasticity remains a significant challenge. This study investigated the effects of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-induced synaptic plasticity within organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures, offering insights into the functional, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes associated with network inhibition via voltage-gated sodium channel blockade. Our experiments demonstrate that TTX treatment induces substantial functional plasticity of excitatory synapses, as evidenced by increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitudes and frequencies in both dentate granule cells and CA1 pyramidal neurons. Correlating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we identified novel targets for future research into homeostatic plasticity, including cytoglobin, SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase Activating Protein 3, Transferrin receptor, and 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 1. These data provide a valuable resource for future studies aiming to understand the orchestration of homeostatic plasticity by metabolic pathways in distinct cell types of the central nervous system.},

 abstract = {La fibrosis quística (FQ) es una enfermedad crónica y progresiva, de origen genético, de herencia autosómica recesiva, causada por mutaciones en el gen que codifica para la proteína reguladora de la conductancia transmembrana de la fibrosis quística (CFTR -de sus siglas en inglés-). La disfunción de esta proteína tiene como consecuencia una deshidratación de secreciones normales de células epiteliales de diversos órganos, provocando espesamiento del moco y obstrucción de espacios. La enfermedad presenta, por lo tanto, manifestaciones multisistémicas, siendo la afección pulmonar y sus complicaciones las responsables del deterioro clínico de los pacientes. A nivel mundial se han realizado grandes esfuerzos para entender la prevalencia, el impacto clínico y evolución de infecciones pulmonares con patógenos “clásicos” de la FQ, como Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae y bacterias pertenecientes al Complejo Burkholderia cepacia (CBc). Los patógenos respiratorios en general, pueden adoptar diferentes mecanismos de adaptación y sobrevida para establecerse en un "nicho protegido" dentro del hospedador durante la infección crónica. Las estrategias más estudiadas son la formación de biofilm en las mucosas y la sobrevida intracelular, ya sea en células epiteliales o del sistema inmune del hospedador. 
En el capítulo I, a fin de responder a una problemática local y un avance a nivel mundial, estudiamos la epidemiología de un patógeno “no convencional”, o “desvalorizado” en la FQ como lo es Escherichia coli. Hicimos una caracterización fenotípica de 27 aislamientos recuperados de 7 pacientes, 3 con infección pulmonar crónica y 4 con infección transitoria. A través de la secuenciación genómica completa de 5 aislamientos recuperados secuencialmente de una de las pacientes con infección crónica realizamos la caracterización del pangenoma de los aislados y un estudio genómico comparativo para entender su evolución. Encontramos que, un linaje epidémico virulento multirresistente, de distribución global de E. coli (ST131 clado C1/H30R asociado a FluoQ-R) puede ser un colonizador persistente de las vías aéreas de las personas con FQ. Encontramos que este clon puede adaptarse y persistir como infección pulmonar crónica porque posee la capacidad de experimentar cambios fenotípicos y genómicos similares a los que experimentan los "patógenos clásicos” de FQ. 
En el capítulo II, estudiamos a Burkholderia contaminans, una especie del complejo Burkholderia cepacia, frecuente en ciertos países de América Latina y Europa, que puede causar infección pulmonar crónica en personas con fibrosis quística. Buscamos obtener información sobre las infecciones pulmonares a largo plazo con un enfoque en la búsqueda de los fenotípicos bacterianos que resultan marcadores del pronóstico clínico de los pacientes. Se investigaron las características genotípicas de 85 aislamientos de B. contaminans recuperados de 70 pacientes. Para 16 de esos pacientes, analizamos el estado clínico y las características fenotípicas bacterianas. La aparición de ciertos fenotipos bacterianos en la infección crónica como el fenotipo no mucoide, variantes de colonias pequeñas, colonias pigmentadas e hipermutadores, junto a la co-infección con Pseudomonas aeruginosa, han sido identificados como posibles marcadores de infecciones más desafiantes y de mal pronóstico. Nuestros estudios han revelado que la presencia de co-colonizadores y los fenotipos bacterianos especialmente adaptados para persistir en las infecciones del tracto respiratorio a largo plazo desempeñan un papel crucial en la evolución clínicos de los pacientes. 
Por último, en el capítulo III nos propusimos desarrollar una herramienta para avanzar en el conocimiento sobre el patrimonio genético de B. contaminans y su capacidad de adaptación y persistencia en el hospedador. Existe aún para estos organismos una interesante controversia en torno a la/las formas de colonización y persistencia: ¿es el biofilm, la sobrevida intracelular, o tal vez una combinación de ambas, lo que les permite persistir en la infección crónica? Con el objetivo de dilucidar estos, entre otros controvertidos interrogantes, se diseñó un vector eficaz para desarrollar técnicas de secuenciación de inserción de transposones. Este vector resultó ser una herramienta eficiente tanto en Burkholderia contaminans como Burkholderia puraquae, que nos permitirá aumentar significativamente el acceso al conocimiento genético de estas especies de las que queda aún mucho por estudiar.},

@article{li_functional_2025,
 abstract = {Camptothecin (CAM), a well-known plant-derived antitumor compound, is a structurally complex pentacyclic pyrroloquinoline monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) found in various plant species. As a specific MIA, CAM had been thought to share a common upstream biosynthetic pathway with other MIAs such as the antitumor vinblastine and vincristine from Catharanthus roseus. Nevertheless the key enzymes responsible for the consecutive three-step oxidation of the –CH3 of nepetalactol to form the –COOH of 7-deoxyloganetic acid and the subsequent glycosylation of 7-deoxyloganetic acid to yield 7-deoxyloganic acid have yet to be functionally characterized. Here we established an in vivo tandem catalysis assay for the enzymatic catalytic activity characterization of 7-deoxyloganetic acid synthase (7DLS) and 7-deoxyloganetic acid glucosyltransferase (7DLGT), two crucial catalytic enzymes in MIAs biosynthesis, thereby avoiding the difficulty in the detection of the unstable biosynthetic intermediates. The enzyme activity assay platform was conducted through the co-expression of functionally characterized Cr7DLS and Cr7DLGT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae WAT11, substrate feeding, and enzymatic product verification. Two cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) from Camptotheca acuminata, the prestigious resource for CAM, CaCYP76A75 and CaCYP76A76, were identified and functionally characterized to be responsible for the consecutive three-step oxidation of nepetalactol to yield 7-deoxyloganetic acid through reciprocal replacement of Cr7DLS in the in vivo tandem enzyme activity assay platform. Two uridine 5′-diphosphate glycosyltransferases (UGTs), CaUGT709C10 and CaUGT709C11, were functionally characterized to be capable of glycosylating 7-deoxyloganetic acid to yield 7-deoxyloganic acid. This study provides two CYPs as 7DLSs and two UGTs as 7DLGTs, offering potential applications in MIAs biosynthesis.},

 abstract = {An adaptive feature of malaria-causing parasites is the digestion of host hemoglobin (HB) to acquire amino acids (AAs). Here we describe a link between nutrient availability and translation dependent regulation of gene expression as an adaptive strategy. We show that tRNA expression in Plasmodium falciparum does not match the decoding need expected for optimal translation. A subset of tRNAs decoding AAs that are insufficiently provided by HB are lowly expressed, wherein the abundance of a protein-coding transcript is negatively correlated with the decoding requirement of these tRNAs. Proliferation-related genes have evolved a high requirement of these tRNAs, thereby proliferation can be modulated by repressing protein synthesis of these genes during nutrient stress. We conclude that the parasite modulates translation elongation by maintaining a discordant tRNA profile to exploit variations in AA-composition among genes as an adaptation strategy. This study exemplifies metabolic adaptation as an important driving force for protein evolution.},

 abstract = {Podocyte maintenance and stress resistance are exquisitely based on high basal rates of autophagy making these cells a unique model to unravel mechanisms of autophagy regulation. Polyamines have key cellular functions such as proliferation, nucleic acid biosynthesis and autophagy. Here we test whether endogenous spermidine signaling is a driver of basal and dynamic autophagy in podocytes by using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interfere with different steps of polyamine metabolism. Translational studies revealed altered spermidine signaling in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in vivo and in vitro. Exogenous spermidine supplementation emerged as new treatment strategy by successfully activating autophagy in vivo via inhibition of EP300, a protein with an essential role in controlling cell growth, cell division and prompting cells to differentiate to take on specialized functions. Surprisingly, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy based untargeted metabolomics of wild type and autophagy deficient primary podocytes revealed a positive feed-back mechanism whereby autophagy itself maintains polyamine metabolism and spermidine synthesis. The transcription factor MAFB acted as an upstream regulator of polyamine metabolism. Thus, our data highlight a novel positive feedback loop of autophagy and spermidine signaling allowing maintenance of high basal levels of autophagy as a key mechanism to sustain the filtration barrier. Hence, spermidine supplementation may emerge as a new therapeutic to restore autophagy in glomerular disease.},

 abstract = {This study sequenced and assembled the mitochondrial genome of the rare dragonfly species Libellula melli, and submitted the results to the NCBI GenBank database, obtaining the accession number PP588458. The mitochondrial genome spans a total length of 15,149 bp, encompassing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and a control region or D-loop. Of these, 25 genes and segments are located on the heavy strand (H-strand), while the remaining 13 reside on the light strand (L-strand). The nucleotide composition of the L. melli mitochondrial genome exhibits a prominent AT bias (AT = 73.3 \%), with T, C, A, and G bases comprising 34.5 \%, 15.6 \%, 38.8 \%, and 11.1 \% respectively, displaying a positive AT skew of 0.059. Among the 13 PCGs, the primary start codons are ATT, ATG, and TTG, while the primary stop codons are TAA, with instances of TA(C) and T(AT) also observed. RSCU analysis reveals that the most frequently used codon is UUA, with an RSCU value of 3.75, encoding leucine (Leu). The secondary structures of the proteins encoded by the 13 PCGs generally exhibit a trend of α-helix {\textgreater} random coil {\textgreater} extended strand {\textgreater} β-turn.

 abstract = {Delectopecten is a small genus of the family Pectinidae (Bivalvia: Pectinida) that remains poorly studied in terms of both morphology and phylogeny. Here, we describe the first member of this genus from deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems, D. thermus sp. nov., based on morphological investigations and molecular analyses of a specimen collected from the Higashi–Ensei vent field (962-m depth) in the northern Okinawa Trough. Morphologically, this new species resembles D. vancouverensis and D. gelatinosus in shell size, shape, auricle size and sculpture. However, D. thermus sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeneric species (including 9 extant and 12 fossil species) by its unequal auricles (the anterior one being larger than the posterior), inwardly recurved anterior auricle of the left valve and a large byssal notch angle of {\textasciitilde}90°. Comparisons of genetic sequences from three mitochondrial and three nuclear gene fragments supported the placement of the new species in the genus Delectopecten. Further phylogenetic analyses using these gene markers support that Delectopecten is monophyletic and positioned as an early diverging clade of the family Pectinidae. Additionally, the mitogenome of D. thermus sp. nov. was assembled and annotated, a first for its genus – revealing significant divergences in gene order compared to other pectinids. The 16S rRNA amplicon analysis of the gill tissue indicated that this vent-dwelling scallop does not exhibit symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. A key to all known species of Delectopecten is provided to aid the identification of species in this understudied genus. ZooBank: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D3D5D4AD-EE39-49F0-9782-12A5D6752A67},

The Gracilariales is a highly diverse and widely distributed order including species that can serve as ecosystem engineers in intertidal habitats and several notorious introduced species. The genus Gracilaria is cultivated worldwide, in part for its production of agar and other bioactive compounds with downstream pharmaceutical and industrial applications. This genus is also emerging as a model for algal evolutionary ecology. Here, we report new whole-genome assemblies for two species (Gracilaria chilensis and Gracilaria gracilis), a draft genome assembly of Gracilaria caudata, and genome annotation of the previously published Gracilaria vermiculophylla genome. To facilitate accessibility and comparative analysis, we integrated these data in a newly created web-based portal dedicated to red algal genomics (https://rhodoexplorer.sb-roscoff.fr).

 abstract = {In 2016, a 68-year-old patient with a disseminated multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection was successfully treated using lytic bacteriophages. Here we report the genomes of the nine phages used for treatment and three strains of A. baumannii isolated prior to and during treatment. The phages used in the initial treatment are related, T4-like myophages. Analysis of 19 A. baumannii isolates collected before and during phage treatment shows that resistance to the T4-like phages appeared two days following the start of treatment. We generate complete genomic sequences for three A. baumannii strains (TP1, TP2 and TP3) collected before and during treatment, supporting a clonal relationship. Furthermore, we use strain TP1 to select for increased resistance to five of the phages in vitro, and identify mutations that are also found in phage-insensitive isolates TP2 and TP3 (which evolved in vivo during phage treatment). These results support that in vitro investigations can produce results that are relevant to the in vivo environment.},

 abstract = {Precisely calling chromatin loops has profound implications for further analysis of gene regulation and disease mechanisms. Technological advances in chromatin conformation capture (3C) assays make it possible to identify chromatin loops in the genome. However, a variety of experimental protocols have resulted in different levels of biases, which require distinct methods to call true loops from the background. Although many bioinformatics tools have been developed to address this problem, there is still a lack of special introduction to loop-calling algorithms. This review provides an overview of the loop-calling tools for various 3C-based techniques. We first discuss the background biases produced by different experimental techniques and the denoising algorithms. Then, the completeness and priority of each tool are categorized and summarized according to the data source of application. The summary of these works can help researchers select the most appropriate method to call loops and further perform downstream analysis. In addition, this survey is also useful for bioinformatics scientists aiming to develop new loop-calling algorithms.},

 abstract = {With the advances of deep learning techniques, various architectures for molecular generation have been proposed for de novo drug design. Successful cases from academia and industrial demonstrated that the deep learning-based de novo molecular design could efficiently accelerate the drug discovery process. The flourish of the de novo molecular generation methods and applications created a great demand for the visualization and functional profiling for the de novo generated molecules. The rising of publicly available chemogenomic databases lays good foundations and creates good opportunities for comprehensive profiling of the de novo library. In this paper, we present DenovoProfiling, a webserver dedicated to de novo library visualization and functional profiling. Currently, DenovoProfiling contains six modules: (1) identification \&amp;amp; visualization, (2) chemical space, (3) scaffold analysis, (4) molecular alignment, (5) drugs mapping, and (6) target \&amp;amp; pathway. DenovoProfiling could provide structural identification, chemical space exploration, drug mapping, and target \&amp;amp; pathway information. The comprehensive annotated information could give users a clear picture of their de novo library and could guide the further selection of candidates for synthesis and biological confirmation. DenovoProfiling is freely available at http://denovoprofiling.xielab.net.},

 abstract = {Until now, although different studies have shown the potential prebiotic effect of seaweed carbohydrates, no studies with the whole seaweeds have been carried out. In addition, the prebiotic effect throughput sequencing remains poorly investigated since most of the published works used qPCR or FISH to estimate bacterial changes. In this work, an in vitro model of the human distal colon was used to determine, for the first time, the potential prebiotic effect of a brown whole seaweed Himanthalia elongata. The whole seaweed was characterized in basis of its nutritional and mineral composition and submitted to the entire gastrointestinal digestion. The prebiotic effect was evaluated by the microbial modulation through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR and short-chain fatty acid analysis. The obtained results indicated that the colonic fraction of H. elongata was used selectively by the Bacteroides genus, more specifically by the specie Bacteoides ovatus, whereas inulin was used mainly by the Parabacteroides genus, being Parabacteroides distasonis the most abundant identified specie. Selective use of inulin by P. distasonis is, therefore, reported by the first time. qPCR analysis shown no significative differences in Bifidobacterium population and a decrease in Lactobacillus along the fermentation assays with both substrates. Regarding to the short-fatty acid production, maximal concentration, 56.11 ± 20.48 mM, was achieved for H. elongata, at 24 h of fermentation whereas for inulin total acid production was 93.66 ± 21.82 mM at 48 h of assay. The metabolic pathways associated with bacterial genera were not significantly different between the two tested substrates. Although more studies are necessary to elucidate the prebiotic character of H. elongata, the results presented in this work are promissory and could open new opportunities of research and application in the area of Nutrition and Food Chemistry.},

We generated multi-omics profiles and constructed a high-resolution map of 3D genome architecture of rhesus macaque during corticogenesis. By comparing the 3D genomes of human, macaque, and mouse brains, we identified many human-specific chromatin structure changes, including 499 topologically associating domains (TADs) and 1,266 chromatin loops. The human-specific loops are significantly enriched in enhancer-enhancer interactions, and the regulated genes show human-specific expression changes in the subplate, a transient zone of the developing brain critical for neural circuit formation and plasticity. Notably, many human-specific sequence changes are located in the human-specific TAD boundaries and loop anchors, which may generate new transcription factor binding sites and chromatin structures in human. Collectively, the presented data highlight the value of comparative 3D genome analyses in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of brain development and evolution.},

Six Sst encoding genes (sst1 to sst6) have been identified in teleost fish genomes but little is known about their function. The present study aimed at replicating the context of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and clarifying the involvement of sst3 in the intestine innate defence barrier in zebrafish larvae. We first established a CRISP/Cas9 sst3 deficient line (MT) and analysed the morphological and transcriptomic response to 0.4\% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Alcian blue staining of larval sections 6 days post fertilization showed an increased in acidic mucins in the intestinal bulb and mid-intestine, with a much stronger response in the MT compared to wild type (WT). The transcriptomic analysis revealed that WT and MT shared enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways linked to catabolism, chondrocyte development, innate immune system, xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress. In contrast, the WT specific response to DSS was enriched in GO terms and pathways linked to transcription and translation, various developmental processes, regulation of biosynthetic processes, apelin signalling and apoptosis while the MT specific response included terms and pathways linked to protein metabolism and catabolic processes, extracellular matrix – receptor interaction and proteasome and chondrocyte development. Overall, this study demonstrated that Sst3 deficiency impairs insulin growth factor and adipocytokine signalling exacerbating the inflammatory response to DSS.},

 abstract = {Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) is a commonly prescribed immunosuppressant that demonstrates important clinical relevance. However, MMF therapy is linked to frequent gastrointestinal (GI) side effects that limit its use. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying MMF-induced GI injury. Using a primary mouse colon organoid model, we have found that mycophenolic acid (MPA), the pharmacologically active metabolite of MMF, significantly alters intestinal barrier function and permeability through modulation of tight junctions. RNA sequencing revealed that MPA significantly disrupted pathways related to cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, cytoskeleton dynamics, and suppression of senescence. MPA was observed to significantly reduce cellular proliferation, which was ameliorated through guanosine supplementation. Addition of exogenous guanosine was also observed to significantly restore barrier function back to control levels. The guanosine studies presented in this thesis suggest MPA’s inhibition of nucleotide metabolism is not selective for lymphocytes but is broader than originally described. This work represents one of the first investigations of MPA using a colon organoid model, providing critical insights into the intracellular mechanisms of MPA-induced GI toxicity.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 pandemic is the first global health crisis to occur in the age of big genomic data. Although data generation capacity is well established and sufficiently standardized, analytical capacity is not. To establish analytical capacity it is necessary to pull together global computational resources and deliver the best open source tools and analysis workflows within a ready to use, universally accessible resource. Such a resource should not be controlled by a single research group, institution, or country. Instead it should be maintained by a community of users and developers who ensure that the system remains operational and populated with current tools. A community is also essential for facilitating the types of discourse needed to establish best analytical practices. Bringing together public computational research infrastructure from the USA, Europe, and Australia, we developed a distributed data analysis platform that accomplishes these goals. It is immediately accessible to anyone in the world and is designed for the analysis of rapidly growing collections of deep sequencing datasets. We demonstrate its utility by detecting allelic variants in high-quality existing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing datasets and by continuous reanalysis of COG-UK data. All workflows, data, and documentation is available at https://covid19.galaxyproject.org.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Campylobacter ureolyticus is an emerging pathogen increasingly appreciated as a common cause of gastroenteritis and extra-intestinal infections in humans. Outside the setting of gastroenteritis, little work has been done to describe the genomic content and relatedness of the species, especially regarding clinical isolates. We reviewed the epidemiology of clinical C. ureolyticus cultured by our institution over the past 10 years. Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization suggested that these C. ureolyticus comprised a species complex of 10 species clusters (SCs) and several subspecies clusters. Although some orthologous genes or gene functions were enriched in isolates found in different SCs and clinical specimens, no association was significant. Nearly a third of the isolates possessed antimicrobial resistance genes, including the ermA resistance gene, potentially conferring resistance to macrolides, the treatment of choice for severe human campylobacteriosis. This work effectively doubles the number of publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes, provides further clarification of taxonomic relationships within this bacterial complex, and identifies target SCs for future analysis.},

@article{maldonado-pava_exploring_2024,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Phosphorus (P) is essential for biological systems, playing a pivotal role in energy metabolism and forming crucial structural components of DNA and RNA. Yet its bioavailable forms are scarce. Phytate, a major form of stored phosphorus in cereals and soils, is poorly bioavailable due to its complex structure. Phytases, enzymes that hydrolyze phytate to release useable phosphorus, are vital in overcoming this limitation and have significant biotechnological applications. This study employed novel method to isolate and characterize bacterial strains capable of metabolizing phytate as the sole carbon and phosphorus source from the Andes mountains soils. Ten strains from the genera {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Klebsiella{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and Chryseobacterium were isolated, with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Chryseobacterium{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} sp. CP-77 and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Klebsiella pneumoniae{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} CP-84 showing specific activities of 3.5 ± 0.4 nkat/mg and 40.8 ± 5 nkat/mg, respectively. Genomic sequencing revealed significant genetic diversity, suggesting CP-77 may represent a novel {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Chryseobacterium{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} species. A fosmid library screening identified several phytase genes, including a 3-phytase in CP-77 and a glucose 1-phosphatase and 3-phytase in CP-84. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the novelty of these enzymes. These findings highlight the potential of phytase-producing bacteria in sustainable agriculture by enhancing phosphorus bioavailability, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers, and contributing to environmental management. This study expands our biotechnological toolkit for microbial phosphorus management and underscores the importance of exploring poorly characterized environments for novel microbial functions. The integration of direct cultivation with metagenomic screening offers robust approaches for discovering microbial biocatalysts, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and advancing environmental conservation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{manna_endosomal_2023,
 abstract = {Contractile vacuoles (CVs), enigmatic osmoregulatory organelles, share common characteristics, such as a requirement for RAB11 and high levels of V-ATPase. These commonalities suggest a conserved evolutionary origin for the CVs with implications for understanding of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and eukaryotic diversification more broadly. A taxonomically broader sampling of CV-associated machinery is required to address this question further. We used a transcriptomics-based approach to identify CV-associated gene products in Dictyostelium discoideum. This approach was first validated by assessing a set of known CV-associated gene products, which were significantly upregulated following hypo-osmotic exposure. Moreover, endosomal and vacuolar gene products were enriched in the upregulated gene set. An upregulated SNARE protein (NPSNB) was predominantly plasma membrane localised and enriched in the vicinity of CVs, supporting the association with this organelle found in the transcriptomic analysis. We therefore confirm that transcriptomic approaches can identify known and novel players in CV function, in our case emphasizing the role of endosomal vesicle fusion machinery in the D. discoideum CV and facilitating future work to address questions regarding the deep evolution of eukaryotic organelles.},

@article{marco_dorq-seq_2024,
 abstract = {Due to its high modification content tRNAs are notoriously hard to quantify by reverse transcription and RNAseq. Bypassing numerous biases resulting from concatenation of enzymatic treatments, we here report a hybrid approach that harnesses the advantages of hybridization-based and deep sequencing–based approaches. The method renders obsolete any RNAseq related workarounds and correction factors that affect accuracy, sensitivity, and turnaround time. Rather than by reverse transcription, quantitative information on the isoacceptor composition of a tRNA pool is transferred to a cDNA mixture in a single step procedure, thereby omitting all enzymatic conversations except for the subsequent barcoding PCR. As a result, a detailed tRNA composition matrix can be obtained from femtomolar amounts of total tRNA. The method is fast, low in cost, and its bioinformatic data workup surprisingly simple. These properties make the approach amenable to high-throughput investigations including clinical samples, as we have demonstrated by application to a collection of variegated biological questions, each answered with novel findings. These include tRNA pool quantification of polysome-bound tRNA, of tRNA modification knockout strains under stress conditions, and of Alzheimer patients’ brain tissues.},

@article{marimon_pertussis_2024,
 abstract = {Background: Pertussis has re-emerged in many countries despite the wide use of vaccines for over 60 years. During 2023, we observed an increase in the incidence of pertussis in Gipuzkoa, north of Spain (with a population of 657,140 inhabitants), mainly affecting children between 11 and 15 years of age. Methods: This study included all confirmed cases diagnosed by PCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples. The genome of seven isolates collected in 2023 was sequenced. Results: Between 2018 and 2023, 884 cases of whooping cough were diagnosed. Pertussis incidence (in cases per 100,000 inhabitants) decreased from 36.7 in 2018 to no cases in 2021, increasing again to 56.8 in 2023. In 2023, the age group of 11–15 years old had the highest incidence rate of 409.3. Only 2 of the 56 children {\textless} 6 years old required hospitalization, and there were no deaths. The seven isolates collected in 2023 showed the same BPagST-4 (ptxA1/ptxP3/prn2/fim2-1/fim3-1 allelic combination), with all of them expressing the pertactin antigen. Conclusions: Immunity waning after the last dose of vaccination at 6 years old, together with the lack of circulation of Bordetella pertussis during the COVID-19 pandemic, were probably the main reasons for the high increase in the incidence of pertussis in Gipuzkoa in 2023.},

 abstract = {In the present work, we assembled and characterized a de novo larval transcriptome of the Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus by taking advantage of publicly available databases with the goal of better understanding its larval development. The assembled transcriptome comprised 37,117 protein-coding transcripts, of which 13,633 full-length ({\textgreater}80\% coverage), with an Ex90N50 of 3061 bp and 76\% of complete and single-copy core vertebrate genes orthologues. Of these transcripts, 34,980 had a hit against the EggNOG database and 14,983 with the KEGG database. Codon usage bias was identified in processes such as translation and muscle development. By comparing our data with a set of representative fish species, 87.1\% of tuna transcripts were included in orthogroups with other species and 5.1\% in assembly-specific orthogroups, which were enriched in terms related to muscle and bone development, visual system and ion transport. Following this comparative approach, protein families related to myosin, extracellular matrix and immune system resulted significantly expanded in the Atlantic bluefin tuna. Altogether, these results provide a glimpse of how the Atlantic bluefin tuna might have achieved early physical advantages over competing species in the pelagic environment. The information generated lays the foundation for future research on the more detailed exploration of physiological responses at the molecular level in different larval stages and paves the way to evolutionary studies on the Atlantic bluefin tuna.},

Some evidence relates to ‘impact’ (i.e. in the infrastructure’s sphere of \textit{interest}) whilst other to ‘performance’ (i.e. the spheres of \textit{control} and \textit{influence}), and there is not always a clear boundary between the two. Mapping against the main ‘impact areas’ of ELIXIR is provided, and so is mapping against the \textit{objectives of greatest relevance for research infrastructures}, as identified by the European Strategy Board on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).},

 abstract = {Les affections respiratoires sont la seconde cause de contre-performance chez le cheval athlète. Elles sont associées à un ensemble de signes cliniques dont certains sont déclenchés ou exacerbés par la présence de micro-organismes dans la sphère respiratoire de l’animal. Les bactéries du genre Mycoplasma, atypiques par leurs caractéristiques phénotypiques et génomiques, ont été décrites comme associées à des infections respiratoires à l'échelle mondiale, tant chez l’homme que les animaux d'élevage. Elles sont retrouvées avec une prévalence proche de 15 \% dans les lavages respiratoires équins reçus pour diagnostic sans que leur rôle clinique ne soit clairement défini. Pour comprendre le rôle de ces bactéries, un protocole mixte, associant culture et amplification génique à partir d’un enrichissement sur bouillon du prélèvement initial, a été validé. Cette méthode a été utilisée sur 1948 échantillons de 1764 chevaux, reçus sur la période 2020-2022. La prévalence des bactéries du genre Mycoplasma a été affinée à 16,1\% avec une prédominance de l’espèce M. equirhinis (85,3\%). La détection de M. equirhinis n’a pas pu être associée à des signes cliniques rapportés par les vétérinaires. Toutefois, une détection plus importante chez les chevaux de races de course et ceux vivant en box, dans les lavages trachéaux, a été mise en évidence. Dans les liquides bronchoalvéolaires, M. equirhinis a été identifié de façon concomitante à une inflammation à médiation neutrophilique. La prévalence de M. equirhinis est augmentée en présence d’autres micro-organismes tels que Streptococcus zooepidemicus, EHV-5 et Actinobacillus equuli. L’analyse des génomes de diverses souches de M. equirhinis montre une homogénéité importante de l’espèce malgré la présence d’éléments génétiques mobiles. Les gènes associés à la virulence retrouvés sont caractéristiques du genre Mycoplasma et très similaires à ceux détectés dans l’espèce M. hominis, un pathogène opportuniste de la sphère génitale chez l’homme, phylogénétiquement très proche de M. equirhinis. Tous ces éléments conduisent donc à considérer M. equirhinis comme un agent opportuniste au sein d’un complexe respiratoire équin, qu’il s’agira de caractériser plus finement par sa détection quantitative dans les prélèvements initiaux et l’analyse plus global du microbiote respiratoire.},

 abstract = {Dysregulation of the epigenetic machinery is associated with neurodevelopmental defects in humans. Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by heterozygous alterations in the gene EHMT1 that cause loss-of-function. EHTM1 and EHMT2 are highly similar histone methyltransferases that play relevant roles in development. Despite their similarity, individuals with alterations in EHMT2 have never been described. Here, we describe a pediatric patient with a KS-overlapping phenotype and a single base de novo substitution in EHMT2 that causes the amino acid change p.Ala1077Ser in the catalytic SET domain. This change causes a reduction in the affinity of the catalytic domain for the H3 tail and in the activity of the enzyme by three- to five-fold. DNA methylation, histone methylation and gene expression profiles suggest a significant overlap between the EHMT2 p.Ala1077Ser variant and KS. Based on this evidence we suggest that EHMT2 haploinsufficiency causes a Kleefstra-like syndrome. Although we cannot rule out dominant negative effects caused by the EHMT2 p.Ala1077Ser variant, our data and previously published data suggest that loss of EHMT2 function is probably more detrimental to cells than loss of EHMT1, explaining why individuals with alterations in EHMT2 are very rare.},

 abstract = {Cytokines are highly pleiotropic ligands that regulate the immune response. Here, using interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we perform detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human CD4+ T helper 1 (Th-1) cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We identify CDK8 as a negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities, which interacts with STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecule inhibitors, reduces the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23\% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 S727 phosphorylation. STAT3 binding to target DNA sites in the genome is increased upon CDK8 inhibition, which results in a concomitant increase in STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions results in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity by modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to diversification of IL-6 responses.},

 abstract = {LAMA2, coding for the laminin-α2 chain, is a crucial ECM component, particularly abundant in skeletal muscle. Mutations in LAMA2 trigger the often-lethal LAMA2-congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD). Various phenotypes have been linked to LAMA2-CMD; nevertheless, the precise mechanisms that malfunction during disease onset in utero remain unknown. We generated Lama2-deficient C2C12 cells and found that Lama2-deficient myoblasts display proliferation, differentiation, and fusion defects, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, fetal myoblasts isolated from the dyW mouse model of LAMA2-CMD display impaired differentiation and fusion in vitro. We also showed that disease onset during fetal development is characterized by a significant down-regulation of gene expression in muscle fibers, causing pronounced effects on cytoskeletal organization, muscle differentiation, and altered DNA repair and oxidative stress responses. Together, our findings provide unique insights into the critical importance of the laminin-α2 chain for muscle differentiation and muscle cell homeostasis.

 abstract = {The predator Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) represents one of the major threats to honeybee survival. Viral spillover from bee to wasp has been supposed in several studies, and this work aims to identify and study the virome of both insect species living simultaneously in the same foraging area. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on V. velutina and Apis mellifera samples, and replicative form of detected viruses was carried out by strand-specific RT-PCR. Overall, 6 and 9 different viral types were reported in V. velutina and A. mellifera, respectively, and five of these viruses were recorded in both hosts. Varroa destructor virus-1 and Cripavirus NB-1/2011/HUN (now classified as Triato-like virus) were the most represented viruses detected in both hosts, also in replicative form. In this investigation, Triato-like virus, as well as Aphis gossypii virus and Nora virus, was detected for the first time in honeybees. Concerning V. velutina, we report for the first time the recently detected honeybee La Jolla virus. A general high homology rate between genomes of shared viruses between V. velutina and A. mellifera suggests the efficient transmission of the virus from bee to wasp. In conclusion, our findings highlight the presence of several known and newly reported RNA viruses infecting A. mellifera and V. velutina. This confirms the environment role as an important source of infection and indicates the possibility of spillover from prey to predator.},

 abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious public health problem known to have a multifactorial etiology. The association between gut microbiota and CRC has been widely studied; however, the link between archaea and CRC has not been sufficiently studied. To investigate the involvement of archaea in colorectal carcinogenesis, we performed a metagenomic analysis of 68 formalin-embedded paraffin fixed tissues from tumoral (n = 33) and healthy mucosa (n = 35) collected from 35 CRC Tunisian patients. We used two DNA extraction methods: Generead DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and Chelex. We then sequenced the samples using Illumina Miseq. Interestingly, DNA extraction exclusively using Chelex generated enough DNA for sequencing of all samples. After data filtering and processing, we reported the presence of archaeal sequences, which represented 0.33\% of all the reads generated. In terms of abundance, we highlighted a depletion in methanogens and an enrichment in Halobacteria in the tumor tissues, while the correlation analysis revealed a significant association between the Halobacteria and the tumor mucosa (p {\textless} 0.05). We reported a strong correlation between Natrialba magadii, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and tumor tissues, and a weak correlation between Methanococcus voltae and healthy adjacent mucosa. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of archaeome analysis from formol fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues using simple protocols ranging from sampling to data analysis, and reported a significant association between Halobacteria and tumor tissues in Tunisian patients with CRC. The importance of our study is that it represents the first metagenomic analysis of Tunisian CRC patients’ gut microbiome, which consists of sequencing DNA extracted from paired tumor-adjacent FFPE tissues collected from CRC patients. The detection of archaeal sequences in our samples confirms the feasibility of carrying out an archaeome analysis from FFPE tissues using a simple DNA extraction protocol. Our analysis revealed the enrichment of Halobacteria, especially Natrialba magadii, in tumor mucosa compared to the normal mucosa in CRC Tunisian patients. Other species were also associated with CRC, including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Methanococcus voltae, which is a methanogenic archaea; both species were found to be correlated with adjacent healthy tissues.},

 abstract = {Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in plants is essential to several aspects of plant development, such as tolerance to environmental stresses and growth. ABA signaling is also important for storage organ formation in crops, such as sweet potato. However, the repertoire of I. batatas ABA signaling gene families has not yet been fully characterized, so that it is unclear which members of these families are necessary for tuberization. Therefore, genome-wide identification of the sweet potato ABF/ AREB/ ABI5, SnRK2, and PYL gene families was performed, along with phylogenetic, motif, cis-regulatory element (CRE), and expression analyses. Nine ABF, eight SnRK2, and eleven PYL gene family members were identified, and there was high sequence conservation among these proteins that were revealed by phylogenetic and motif analyses. The promoter sequences of these genes had multiple CREs that were involved in hormone responses and stress responses. In silico and qRT-PCR expression analyses revealed that these genes were expressed in various tissues and that IbABF3, IbABF4, IbDPBF3, IbDPBF4, IbPYL4, IbSnRK2.1, and IbSnRK2.2 were significantly expressed during storage root development. These results are an important reference that can be used for functional validation studies to better understand how ABA signaling elicits storage root formation at the molecular level.},

 abstract = {Auxin is a plant phytohormone that is essential for the initiation of tuberization in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.). Auxin exerts these effects via polar auxin transport facilitated by various auxin influx and efflux carriers. It is unclear which members of the auxin transporter families: PIN, PILS, Aux/LAX, and ABCB, are involved in sweet potato tuber initiation and development. Therefore, a genome-wide analysis of the I. batatas auxin transporter genes was conducted, and their expression patterns during storage root initiation and development were analyzed. Five IbLAX, 16 IbPIN, 12 IbPILS, and 34 IbABCB family members were identified. These genes showed high conservation among families based on their intron-exon structure, motif composition, and phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, the promoter regions of these genes had various cis-acting regulatory elements involved in hormone, light, and developmental responses. The auxin transporter genes were expressed in various sweet potato tissues, and many were differentially expressed during storage root development. IbLAX1, IbPIN13, IbPILS7, IbABCB1, and IbABCB14 showed up-regulated expression during tuber initiation. This study characterizes these auxin transporter gene families for the first time. These results are an important reference for validation studies to determine the specific functions of these genes and their auxin transporting capability.},

@article{matsuura-suzuki_mirna-mediated_2024,
 abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a wide variety of biological processes by silencing their target genes. Argonaute (AGO) proteins load miRNAs to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates translational repression and/or mRNA decay of the targets. A scaffold protein called GW182 directly binds AGO and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, initiating the mRNA decay reaction. Although previous studies have demonstrated the critical role of GW182 in cultured cells as well as in cell-free systems, its biological significance in living organisms remains poorly explored, especially in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we generated gw182-null flies using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that, unexpectedly, they can survive until an early second-instar larval stage. Moreover, in vivo miRNA reporters can be effectively repressed in gw182-null first-instar larvae. Nevertheless, gw182-null flies have defects in the expression of chitin-related genes and the formation of the larval trachea system, preventing them from completing larval development. Our results highlight the importance of both GW182-dependent and -independent silencing mechanisms in vivo.},

 abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women worldwide. The majority of breast cancer occurs sporadically, with only 5-10\% being caused by inheritance of susceptibility genes. In Brunei Darussalam, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women. The prevalence and clinical relevance of breast cancer susceptibility genes in Brunei breast cancer patients is unknown. We investigated the prevalence and clinical relevance of germline TP53 and PALB2 genes, recognised to confer a high and moderate risk respectively, in the development of breast cancer in an unselected cohort of Brunei breast cancer patients. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of 54 unselected Brunei breast cancer patients. The DNA samples were sequenced for germline BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PALB2 variants using targeted panel sequencing on a Hi-Plex NGS platform. Identified variants were analysed for their pathogenicity classification based on clinical/population/mutation databases, in-silico data, and available functional data analysis. Chi-square test was used to determine the association between TP53 codon 72 and response to chemotherapy in Brunei breast cancer patients. Results: We identified two TP53 and five PALB2 missense variants in our study population. Five of the identified variants were classified as variants of uncertain significance (one in TP53 and four in PALB2 ) giving a prevalence of TP53 and PALB2 variant of uncertain significance carriers at 1.9\% and 9.3\%, respectively. No pathogenic TP53 and PALB2 mutation was identified in this study suggesting the rarity of these genes in breast cancer. TP53 codon 72 had no association with Brunei breast cancer patients’ response to chemotherapy supporting the benign characteristic of the variant P72R. Conclusions: Our current findings suggest that the contribution of germline TP53 and PALB2 genes in unselected Brunei breast cancer patients is rare, and a larger number of participants will be required to confirm this finding.},

Our analysis revealed epigenetic heterogeneity was a key characteristic of IPF AMs. DNAm ‘clock’ analysis indicated epigenetic alterations in IPF-AMs was not associated with accelerated ageing. In differential DNAm analysis, we identified numerous differentially methylated positions (DMPs, n=11) and regions (DMRs, n=49) between healthy and IPF AMs respectively. DMPs and DMRs encompassed genes involved in lipid (\textit{LPCAT1}) and glucose (\textit{PFKB3}) metabolism and importantly, DNAm status was associated with disease severity in IPF. Collectively, our data identify that profound changes in the epigenome underpin the development and function of AMs in the IPF lung.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, migration, and apoptosis play important roles in many physiological processes and pathological conditions. To identify genetic influences on VSMC behavior, we measured these traits and undertook genome-wide association studies in primary umbilical artery-derived VSMCs from {\textgreater}2000 individuals. Although there were no genome-wide significant associations for VSMC proliferation or migration, genetic variants at two genomic loci (7p15.3 and 7q32.3) showed highly significant associations with VSMC apoptosis (P = 1.95 × 10−13 and P = 7.47 × 10−9, respectively). The lead variant at the 7p51.3 locus was associated with increased expression of the GSDME and PALS2 genes in VSMCs. Knockdown of GSDME or PALS2 in VSMCs attenuated apoptotic cell death. A protein co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that GSDME complexed with PALS2. PALS2 knockdown attenuated activated caspase-3 and GSDME fragmentation, whilst GSDME knockdown also reduced activated caspase-3. These findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of VSMC apoptosis, with potential utility for therapeutic development.},

 abstract = {Fungos do gênero Trichoderma têm se destacado como agentes de controle biológico devido aos diversos mecanismos de ação como também pela relação simbiótica que mantêm com as espécies vegetais. Há um aprofundamento no estudo de sua biologia e de seu manejo agrícola, havendo ainda uma demanda de conhecimentos genômicos e taxonômicos deste fungo. Desta forma, foi proposto a obtenção dos genomas completos dos isolado 30/07 (T. lentiforme) e 19/17 (T. camerunense) e a verificação do efeito da inoculação destes fungos em tomateiros, em diferentes condições de plantio, quanto a promoção de crescimento e a interação com fitopatógenos. Foram utilizados dois substratos (Tropstrato e Vivatto) com diferentes efeitos nas plantas. A partir destas condições de plantio e após inoculação com Trichoderma, foram analisados os seguintes parâmetros em tomateiro:  emergência das mudas e crescimento das plantas e indução da resistência contra doenças causadas por Fusarium oxysporum e Botrytis cinerea. Para a eficácia do sequenciamento, foram testados 3 métodos de extração de DNA: CTAB-brometo de cetiltrimetilamônio, DNeasy Plant Mini kit -QIAGEN e Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit-PROMEGA. A obtenção dos genomas completos dos isolados foi realizada por meio da tecnologia Oxford Nanopore -MinION (sequências longas) e a plataforma NextSeq-Illumina. Os resultados dos ensaios de promoção de crescimento demonstraram que as condições de plantio podem influenciar diretamente no efeito do Trichoderma nas plantas, podendo ser positivo ou negativo. O tratamento prévio do Trichoderma nas plantas de tomateiro não foi eficaz contra a fusariose, mas teve um efeito redutor contra o mofo cinzento. O antagonista também não causou um efeito positivo na emergência das mudas. O método CTAB foi o mais eficiente na extração do DNA dos isolados de Trichoderma, mantendo maior concentração e preservando a molécula. O sequenciamento híbrido com as duas plataformas foi eficiente na obtenção dos genomas completos, que apresentaram tamanhos e conteúdos gênicos semelhantes aos de outras espécies do mesmo gênero já sequenciadas.},

 abstract = {This study investigates the potential of 2-(4-butylbenzyl)-3-hydroxynaphthalene-1,4-dione (11) and its 12 derivatives as anticancer and biofilm formation inhibitors for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus using in silico methods. The study employed various computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulation molecular docking, density functional theory, and global chemical descriptors, to evaluate the interactions between the compounds and the target proteins. The docking results revealed that compounds 9, 11, 13, and ofloxacin exhibited binding affinities of −7.6, −7.9, −7.5, and −7.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, against peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase msrA/msrB (PDB: 3E0M). Ligand (11) showed better inhibition for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus msrA/msrB enzyme. The complex of the 3E0M-ligand 11 remained highly stable across all tested temperatures (300, 305, 310, and 320 K). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to evaluate the behavior of the complex at various temperatures (300, 305, 310, and 320 K), demonstrating a total variance of 85\%. Convergence was confirmed by the eigenvector’s cosine content value of 0.43, consistently displaying low RMSD values, with the minimum observed at 310 K. Furthermore, ligand 11 emerges as the most promising candidate among the compounds examined, showcasing notable potential when considering a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and now in silico data. While the naphthoquinone derivative (11) remains the primary candidate based on comprehensive in silico studies, further analysis using Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) suggests while the Egap value of compound 11 (2.980 eV) and compound 13 (2.975 eV) is lower than ofloxacin (4.369 eV), indicating their potential, so it can be a statement that compound 13 can also be investigated in further research.},

 abstract = {The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aided in understanding the role of microbial communities and the influence of collective genetic material (the ‘microbiome’) in human health and disease. With the evolution of new sequencing technologies, researchers can now investigate the microbiome and map its influence on human health. Advances in bioinformatics methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis have helped researchers to gain an in-depth knowledge about the taxonomic and genetic composition of microbial communities. Metagenomic-based methods have been the most commonly used approaches for microbiome analysis; however, it primarily extracts information about taxonomic composition and genetic potential of the microbiome under study, lacking quantification of the gene products (RNA and proteins). Conversely, metatranscriptomics, the study of a microbial community’s RNA expression, can reveal the dynamic gene expression of individual microbial populations and the community as a whole, ultimately providing information about the active pathways in the microbiome.  In order to address the analysis of NGS data, the ASaiM analysis framework was previously developed and made available via the Galaxy platform. Although developed for both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, the original publication demonstrated the use of ASaiM only for metagenomics, while thorough testing for metatranscriptomics data was lacking.  In the current study, we have focused on validating and optimizing the tools within ASaiM for metatranscriptomics data. As a result, we deliver a robust workflow that will enable researchers to understand dynamic functional response of the microbiome in a wide variety of metatranscriptomics studies. This improved and optimized ASaiM-metatranscriptomics (ASaiM-MT) workflow is publicly available via the ASaiM framework, documented and supported with training material so that users can interrogate and characterize metatranscriptomic data, as part of larger meta-omic studies of microbiomes.},

 abstract = {The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in a major health crisis worldwide with its continuously emerging new strains, resulting in new viral variants that drive "waves" of infection. PCR or antigen detection assays have been routinely used to detect clinical infections; however, the emergence of these newer strains has presented challenges in detection. One of the alternatives has been to detect and characterize variant-specific peptide sequences from viral proteins using mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods. MS methods can potentially help in both diagnostics and vaccine development by understanding the dynamic changes in the viral proteome associated with specific strains and infection waves. In this study, we developed an accessible, flexible, and shareable bioinformatics workflow that was implemented in the Galaxy Platform to detect variant-specific peptide sequences from MS data derived from the clinical samples. We demonstrated the utility of the workflow by characterizing published clinical data from across the world during various pandemic waves. Our analysis identified six SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific peptides suitable for confident detection by MS in commonly collected clinical samples.},

LFQ enables peptide-level quantitation, which is useful in proteomics (analyzing peptides carrying post-translational modifications) and multi-omics studies such as metaproteomics (analyzing taxon-specific microbial peptides) and proteogenomics (analyzing non-canonical sequences). Bioinformatics workflows accessible via the Galaxy platform have proven useful for analysis of such complex multi-omic studies. However, workflows within the Galaxy platform have lacked well-tested LFQ tools. In this study, we have evaluated moFF and FlashLFQ, two open-source LFQ tools, and implemented them within the Galaxy platform to offer access and use via established workflows. Through rigorous testing and communication with the tool developers, we have optimized the performance of each tool. Software features evaluated include: (a) match-between-runs (MBR); (b) using multiple file-formats as input for improved quantification; (c) use of containers and/or conda packages; (d) parameters needed for analyzing large datasets; and (e) optimization and validation of software performance. This work establishes a process for software implementation, optimization, and validation, and offers access to two robust software tools for LFQ-based analysis within the Galaxy platform.},

 abstract = {metaQuantome is a software suite that enables the quantitative analysis, statistical evaluation. and visualization of mass-spectrometry-based metaproteomics data. In the latest update of this software, we have provided several extensions, including a step-by-step training guide, the ability to perform statistical analysis on samples from multiple conditions, and a comparative analysis of metatranscriptomics data. The training module, accessed via the Galaxy Training Network, will help users to use the suite effectively both for functional as well as for taxonomic analysis. We extend the ability of metaQuantome to now perform multi-data-point quantitative and statistical analyses so that studies with measurements across multiple conditions, such as time-course studies, can be analyzed. With an eye on the multiomics analysis of microbial communities, we have also initiated the use of metaQuantome statistical and visualization tools on outputs from metatranscriptomics data, which complements the metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses already available. For this, we have developed a tool named MT2MQ (“metatranscriptomics to metaQuantome”), which takes in outputs from the ASaiM metatranscriptomics workflow and transforms them so that the data can be used as an input for comparative statistical analysis and visualization via metaQuantome. We believe that these improvements to metaQuantome will facilitate the use of the software for quantitative metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics and will enable multipoint data analysis. These improvements will take us a step toward integrative multiomic microbiome analysis so as to understand dynamic taxonomic and functional responses of these complex systems in a variety of biological contexts. The updated metaQuantome and MT2MQ are open-source software and are available via the Galaxy Toolshed and GitHub.},

 abstract = {The prognosis of AML patients with adverse genetics, such as a complex, monosomal karyotype and TP53 lesions, is still dismal even with standard chemotherapy. DNA-hypomethylating agent monotherapy induces an encouraging response rate in these patients. When combined with decitabine (DAC), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) resulted in an improved response rate and longer overall survival in a randomized phase II trial (DECIDER; NCT00867672). The molecular mechanisms governing this in vivo synergism are unclear. We now demonstrate cooperative antileukemic effects of DAC and ATRA on AML cell lines U937 and MOLM-13. By RNA-sequencing, derepression of {\textgreater}1200 commonly regulated transcripts following the dual treatment was observed. Overall chromatin accessibility (interrogated by ATAC-seq) and, in particular, at motifs of retinoic acid response elements were affected by both single-agent DAC and ATRA, and enhanced by the dual treatment. Cooperativity regarding transcriptional induction and chromatin remodeling was demonstrated by interrogating the HIC1, CYP26A1, GBP4, and LYZ genes, in vivo gene derepression by expression studies on peripheral blood blasts from AML patients receiving DAC + ATRA. The two drugs also cooperated in derepression of transposable elements, more effectively in U937 (mutated TP53) than MOLM-13 (intact TP53), resulting in a “viral mimicry” response. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo, the antileukemic and gene-derepressive epigenetic activity of DAC is enhanced by ATRA.},

@article{merida-cerro_rat1_2024,
 abstract = {Certain DNA sequences can adopt a non-B form in the genome that interfere with DNA-templated processes, including transcription. Among the sequences that are intrinsically difficult to transcribe are those that tend to form R-loops, three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed by a DNA-RNA hybrid and the displaced ssDNA. Here we compared the transcription of an endogenous gene with and without an R-loop-forming sequence inserted. We show that, in agreement with previous in vivo and in vitro analyses, transcription elongation is delayed by R-loops in yeast. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Rat1 transcription terminator factor facilitates transcription throughout such structures by inducing premature termination of arrested RNAPIIs. We propose that RNase H degrades the RNA moiety of the hybrid, providing an entry site for Rat1. Thus, we have uncovered an unanticipated function of Rat1 as a transcription restoring factor opening up the possibility that it may also promote transcription through other genomic DNA structures intrinsically difficult to transcribe. If R-loop-mediated transcriptional stress is not relieved by Rat1, it will cause genomic instability, probably through the increase of transcription-replication conflicts, a deleterious situation that could lead to cancer.},

In this study, we designed and deployed a robust, sterilizable hardware system for airborne nucleic acid capture featuring active filtration of a quantifiable, controllable volume of air and a high-integrity chamber to protect the sample from loss or contamination. We used our hardware system on an aircraft across multiple height transects over major aerosolization sources to collect air eDNA, coupled with high-throughput amplicon sequencing using multiple DNA metabarcoding markers targeting bacteria, plants, and vertebrates to test the hypothesis of large-scale genetic presence of these bioaerosols throughout the planetary boundary layer in the lower troposphere. Here, we demonstrate that the multi-taxa DNA assemblages inventoried up to 2,500 m using our airplane-mounted hardware system are reflective of major aerosolization sources in the survey area and show previously unreported airborne species detections (i.e., Allium sativum L). We also pioneer an aerial survey flight grid standardized for atmospheric sampling of genetic material and aeroallergens using a light aircraft and limited resources. Our results show that air eDNA from terrestrial bacteria, plants, and vertebrates is detectable up to high altitude using our airborne air sampler and demonstrate the usefulness of light aircraft in monitoring campaigns. However, our work also underscores the need for improved marker choices and reference databases for species in the air column, particularly eukaryotes. Taken together, our findings reveal strong connectivity or mixing of terrestrial-associated eDNA from ground level aerosolization sources and the atmosphere, and we recommend that parameters and indices considering lifting action, atmospheric instability, and potential for convection be incorporated in future surveys for air eDNA. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for light aircraft campaigns to comprehensively and economically inventory bioaerosol emissions and impacts at scale, enabling transformative future opportunities in airborne DNA technology.},

In January 2021, the re-occurrence of COVID-19 infection was at its peak, considered the second wave of epidemics. In the initial stage, it was considered a double mutant strain due to two significant mutations observed in their Spike protein (E484Q and L452R). Although it was first detected in India later on, it was spread to several countries worldwide, causing high fatality due to this strain. In the present study, we investigated the spreading of B.1.617 strain worldwide through 822 genome sequences submitted in GISAID on 21 April 2021. All genome sequences were analyzed for variations in genome sequences based on their effects due to changes in nucleotides. At Allele frequency 0.05, there were a total of 47 variations in ORF1ab, 22 in Spike protein gene, 6 variations in N gene, 5 in ORF8 and M gene, four mutations in Orf7a, and one nucleotide substitution observed for ORF3a, ORF6 and ORF7b gene. The clustering for similar mutations mentioned B.1.617 sub-lineages. The outcome of this study established relative occurrence and spread worldwide. The study’s finding represented that “double mutant” strain is not only spread through traveling but it is also observed to evolve naturally with different mutations observed in B.1.617 lineage. The information extracted from the study helps to understand viral evolution and genome variations of B.1.617 lineage. The results support the need of separating B.1.617 into sub-lineages.},

The feature genes, which are differentially expressed in the particular cell group, jointly discriminate the given cell group from other cells. Each such group of cells corresponds to a putative cell type or state, characterised by the feature genes as markers. To benchmark this approach, we use expert-annotated scRNA-seq datasets from a range of experiments, as well as comparing to existing cell annotation methods, which are all based on a pre-existing reference. We show that our method automatically identifies the 'ground truth' cell assignments with high accuracy. Moreover, our method, Single Cell Clustering Assessment Framework (SCCAF) predicts new putative biologically meaningful cell-states in published data on haematopoiesis and the human cortex. SCCAF is available as an open-source software package on GitHub (https://github.com/SCCAF/sccaf) and as a Python package index and has also been implemented as a Galaxy tool in the Human Cell Atlas.},

@article{midtbo_cell_2024,
 abstract = {The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite feeding on mucus, skin, and blood of salmonids. On parasitised fish erosions and, at later lice stages, ulcerations appear at the louse feeding site. In susceptible species like Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with a limited rejection of lice, only a mild inflammatory response with minor influx of immune cells is seen at these lesions, as the salmon louse secrete proteins that can dampen immune responses. In a previous study, Lepeophtheirus salmonis labial gland protein 3 (LsLGP3) was suggested to dampen cellular responses, and the present study aimed at increasing our understanding of its mode of action. LsLGP3 was found to be secreted on to the host skin, and both in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to elucidate its function. Histological analysis of the louse attachment site revealed an epidermal and dermal influx of mainly macrophages and granulocytes after 5 days post infestation. The immune cell influx was deeper in the dermis throughout the louse infestation, and LsLGP3 may be involved in dampening this response. Enriched populations of Atlantic salmon B-cells, T-cells, granulocytes, and monocytes were exposed to recombinant LsLGP3 (recLGP3) in vitro, resulting in a significant decrease in cell viability compared to non-exposed controls. An apoptotic cell morphology with “beads-on-a-string” like protrusions was seen in all leukocyte cell fractions after recLGP3 exposure, but not in erythrocytes or keratocytes. A decreased viability was also detected in pink salmon leucocytes, which was not in leucocytes from non-salmonid species. These functional insights suggest that LsLGP3 specifically induces apoptosis of salmonid leukocytes and is likely a key protein secreted by the lice that disables the Atlantic salmon ability to mount an adequate immune response towards the salmon louse. In vivo LsLGP3 knock down studies indicated that the effect is localised primarily at the lice feeding site, without affecting immune cells that are not situated adjacent to the lice-inflicted lesion. The findings from this study could significantly aid in the development of new immune based anti-salmon louse prophylactic measures and treatments.},

 abstract = {Pregnancy involving intricate tissue transformations governed by the progesterone hormone (P4). P4 signaling via P4 receptors (PRs) is vital for endometrial receptivity, decidualization, myometrial quiescence, and labor initiation. This study explored the role of TCF23 as a downstream target of PR during pregnancy. TCF23 was found to be expressed in female reproductive organs, predominantly in uterine stromal and smooth muscle cells. Tcf23 expression was high during midgestation and was specifically regulated by P4, but not estrogen. The Tcf23 knockout (KO) mouse was generated and analyzed. Female KO mice aged 4-6 months exhibited subfertility, reduced litter size, and defective parturition. Uterine histology revealed disrupted myometrial structure, altered collagen organization, and disarrayed smooth muscle sheets at the conceptus sites of KO mice. RNA-Seq analysis of KO myometrium revealed dysregulation of genes associated with cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization. TCF23 potentially modulates TCF12 activity to mediate cell-cell adhesion and matrix modulation in smooth muscle cells. Overall, TCF23 deficiency leads to impaired myometrial remodeling, causing parturition delay and fetal demise. This study sheds light on the critical role of TCF23 as a dowstream mediator of PR in uterine remodeling, reflecting the importance of cell-cell communication and matrix dynamics in myometrial activation and parturition.},

Here, we generated a de novo transcriptome assembly of an intergeneric hybrid between apple and pear, accumulating intermediate levels of phloridzin and arbutin. Combining RNA-seq, in silico functional annotation prediction, targeted gene expression analysis, and expression–metabolite correlations, we identified candidate genes for functional characterization, resulting in the identification of active arbutin synthases in the hybrid and parental genotypes. Despite exhibiting an active arbutin synthase in vitro, the natural lack of arbutin in apples is reasoned by the absence of the substrate and broad substrate specificity. Altogether, our study serves as the basis for future assessment of potential physiological roles of identified genes by genome editing of hybrids and pears.},

 abstract = {COVID-19 pathogenesis is mainly attributed to dysregulated antiviral immune response, the prominent hallmark of COVID-19. As no established drugs are available against SARS-CoV-2 and developing new ones would be a big challenge, repurposing of existing drugs holds promise against COVID-19. Here, we used a signature-based strategy to delve into cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to identify potential host contributors in COVID-19 pathogenesis and to find repurposable drugs using in silico approaches. We scrutinized transcriptomic profile of various human alveolar cell sources infected with SARS-CoV-2 to determine up-regulated genes specific to COVID-19. Enrichment analysis revealed that the up-regulated genes were involved mainly in viral infectious disease, immune system, and signal transduction pathways. Analysis of protein-protein interaction network and COVID-19 molecular pathway resulted in identifying several anti-viral proteins as well as 11 host pro-viral proteins, ADAR, HBEGF, MMP9, USP18, JUN, FOS, IRF2, ICAM1, IFI35, CASP1, and STAT3. Finally, molecular docking of up-regulated proteins and all FDA-approved drugs revealed that both Hydrocortisone and Benzhydrocodone possess high binding affinity for all pro-viral proteins. The suggested repurposed drugs should be subject to complementary in vitro and in vivo experiments in order to be evaluated in detail prior to clinical studies in potential management of COVID-19.},

@mastersthesis{missaghimamaghani_evaluation_2023,
 abstract = {Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to pathological changes. However, the aging process can significantly impact microglial function, leading to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). One aspect of microglial dysfunction during aging involves changes in gene expression, causing abnormal activation or suppression of specific genes. This abnormal gene expression contributes to the pro-inflammatory state observed in aging microglia and AD. In AD, microglia are responsible for clearing amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, a key pathology in the disease. Aging-related alterations impair the microglial ability to effectively remove Aβ plaques, leading to their accumulation and subsequent neuroinflammation. Aberrant gene expression in aging microglia affects phagocytic activity, inflammatory response, and release of neurotoxic factors, exacerbating AD progression. Studies have shown that certain Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 (EIF3) subunits and ribosomal proteins (RP) involved in translation initiation are upregulated in aging microglia at mRNA level. However, the upregulation of these proteins should be examined at the protein level as well due to the post-transcription and translational regulatory processes. Therefore, the levels of these proteins were examined in wild type and APP/PS1 mouse models during aging. The results revealed an increase in different subunits of translation initiation factor 3 specifically EIF3H, EIF3E, EIF3K, and p-EIF4E in microglia during aging and with progression of AD. While RPL7, RPL7A, and RPS25 exhibited a different pattern. Although the results demonstrate upregulation of these proteins in an age-related manner, in APP mice, these proteins showed downregulation compared to wild type mice of the same age. These distinct regulation patterns suggested a crucial role of these proteins in aging and AD. Furthermore, to enhance our comprehension of the functions of EIF3H and EIF3E, we undertook a nucleofection-based strategy to overexpress these proteins within microglial cells. However, the nucleofection attempts were unsuccessful as often reported in the literature for BV-2 cell line. Understanding the significance of aberrant gene expression in aging microglia and its association with AD is crucial for targeted therapeutic strategies. Modulating gene expression and restoring normal microglial function may hold promise in reducing neuroinflammation, promoting Aβ clearance, and potentially slowing down AD progression. EIF4E, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, plays a crucial role in regulating protein synthesis. One of the key mechanisms governing the activity of EIF4E is its phosphorylation which is vital for modulating EIF4E's function and fine-tuning translation initiation. Phosphorylation of EIF4E is tightly regulated by various signaling pathways and is essential for controlling gene expression in response to different cellular stimuli. It acts as a molecular switch, influencing the assembly of the translation initiation complex and determining the efficiency of protein synthesis. Understanding the importance of EIF4E phosphorylation opens avenues for potential therapeutic interventions targeting this key protein and therefore regulating the rate of protein synthesis in this regard. As part of this exploration, we investigated the effect of Tomivosertib, an inhibitor of EIF4E phosphorylation, which controls translation rates. The results demonstrated that Tomivosertib effectively inhibits EIF4E phosphorylation by suppressing MNK1/2 in microglia, thereby decreasing translation rates and alleviating neuroinflammation.},

 abstract = {The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a Type II CRISPR system that has rapidly become the most versatile and widespread tool for genome engineering. It consists of two components, the Cas9 effector protein, and a single guide RNA that combines the spacer (for identifying the target) with the tracrRNA, a trans-activating small RNA required for both crRNA maturation and interference. While there are well-established methods for screening Cas effector proteins and CRISPR arrays, the detection of tracrRNA remains the bottleneck in detecting Class 2 CRISPR systems.We introduce a new pipeline CRISPRtracrRNA for screening and evaluation of tracrRNA candidates in genomes. This pipeline combines evidence from different components of the Cas9-sgRNA complex. The core is a newly developed structural model via covariance models from a sequence-structure alignment of experimentally validated tracrRNAs. As additional evidence, we determine the terminator signal (required for the tracrRNA transcription) and the RNA–RNA interaction between the CRISPR array repeat and the 5′-part of the tracrRNA. Repeats are detected via an ML-based approach (CRISPRidenify). Providing further evidence, we detect the cassette containing the Cas9 (Type II CRISPR systems) and Cas12 (Type V CRISPR systems) effector protein. Our tool is the first for detecting tracrRNA for Type V systems.The implementation of the CRISPRtracrRNA is available on GitHub upon requesting the access permission, (https://github.com/BackofenLab/CRISPRtracrRNA).

 abstract = {Rice tungro disease (RTD), caused by Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) is one of the most prominent viral diseases in Asian countries. This virus disease problem seems to have been accentuated in those countries by causing a series of outbreaks over the years after being first reported in International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines, in 1963. One of the effective ways to combat viruses is through RNA silencing. microRNA is an important player in the RNA silencing mechanism. Genome sequences analysis shows RTBV-SP isolate (8 Kb) is composed of four open reading frames (ORF 1, ORF 2, ORF 3, and ORF 4), meanwhile, RTSV-SP (12 Kb) consists of one open reading frame encoded by seven different polyproteins (P1, CP1, CP2, CP3, NTP, Pro, and Rep). Therefore, this study investigated possible rice-encoded miRNAs targeted on RTBV and RTSV using in silico analysis. Five bioinformatics tools were employed using five different prediction algorithms: miRanda, RNA22, RNAhybrid, Tapirhybrid, and psRNATarget. The results revealed each RTBV and RTSV can be silenced by three potentially best candidate rice-encoded miRNA. For RTBV, osa-miR5510 (accession no. MIMAT0022143), osa-miR3980a-3p (accession no. MIMAT0019676), and osa-miR3980b-3p (accession no. MIMAT0019678) are being predicted by all five algorithms. Meanwhile, for RTSV, three miRNAs predicted are osa-miR414 (accession no. MIMAT0001330), osa-miR5505 (accession no. MIMAT00221138) and osa-miR167a-3p (accession no. MIMAT0006780). The predicted data provide useful material for developing RTBV and RTSV-resistant rice varieties.},

 abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women. The present study explored the potential role of pseudogenes in BC via construction and analysis of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network through a three-step process. First, we screened differentially expressed genes in nine BC datasets. Then the gene-pseudogenes pairs (nine hub genes) were selected according to the functional enrichment and correlation analysis. Second, the candidate hub genes and interacting miRNAs were used to construct the ceRNA network. Further analysis of the ceRNA network revealed a crucial ceRNA module with two genes-pseudogene pairs and two miRNAs. The in-depth analysis identified the GBP1/hsa-miR-30d-5p/GBP1P1 axis as a potential tumorigenic axis in BC patients. In the third step, the GBP1/hsa-miR-30d-5p/GBP1P1 axis expression level was assessed in 40 tumor/normal BC patients and MCF-7 cell lines. The expression of GBP1 and GBP1P1 was significantly higher in the tumor compared to the normal tissue. However, the expression of hsa-miR-30d-5p was lower in tumor samples. Then, we introduced the GBP1P1 pseudogene into the MCF-7 cell line to evaluate its effect on GBP1 and hsa-miR-30d-5p expression. As expected, the GBP1 level increased while the hsa-miR-30d-5p level decreased in the GBP1P1-overexprsssing cell line. In addition, the oncogenic properties of MCF-7 (cell viability, clonogenicity, and migration) were improved after GBP1P1 overexpression. In conclusion, we report a ceRNA network that may provide new insight into the role of pseudogenes in BC development.},

To address this challenge, this study focused on annotating genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in pitaya under biotic (pathogen infection) and abiotic (flowering induction with supplementary light) stress conditions. Using various bioinformatic techniques, transcriptomic data were analyzed to assemble de novo sequences from raw reads for each stress condition. The quality of these assemblies was rigorously evaluated, and a consensus sequence was generated to analyze its homology with related species. Structural and functional annotation of the assemblies was conducted using ab initio and de novo prediction tools, resulting in annotations in GFF3 format that detail both the structure and biological functions of the predicted genes. Subsequently, a differential expression analysis (DEG) was performed to identify genes expressed in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds under different stress conditions. The results revealed nine key enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. Additionally, a MYB transcription factor that regulates gene expression in these pathways was identified. This research underscores the complexity of pitaya's adaptive mechanisms in response to stress, highlighting its activation of specific biosynthetic processes that enhance antioxidant capacity and adaptive ability under adverse conditions.},

Two strategies were tested: assessing strains LCB degradation ability under non-electrochemical and electrochemical conditions. Strain selection was based on literature, and bioinformatical analyses were conducted to predict CAZymes and carbohydrate degradation pathways. Cellulomonas strains have a potential to degrade LCB due to high CAZyme count and specific metabolic pathways. Strains growth capacity on LCB was evaluated by culturing without electrodes on LCB for 12 days, showing superior growth on wheat bran compared to wheat straw. Enzymatic assays indicate laccase activity in all strains, highest in C. biazotea NBRC 12680 (11.66 IU). The strains ability to form electrogenic biofilms on carbon cloth anodes polarized at +0.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) was evaluated. The results indicate that bioanodes can function with wheat bran (max current density: 14.92 mA m−2), with voltammograms showing redox activities. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows lignin and protein degradation in both electrochemical and non-electrochemical experiments. These findings suggest potential use of these strains in electro-microbial systems with LCB.},

 abstract = {There are currently no vaccines available to prevent and control of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an intracellular bacterial pathogen transmitted by ticks that occurs in many regions of the world and causes disease in a wide range of domestic and wild hosts, including humans. Vaccines induce long-lasting immunity and could prevent or reduce transmission of this pathogen. Understanding how vaccines induce a protective response can be difficult due to the complexity of the immune system, which operates at many levels throughout the organism. New perspectives in vaccinology, based on systems biology approaches, integrate many scientific disciplines to fully understand the biological responses to vaccination, where a transcriptomic approach could reveal relevant information of the host immune system, allowing profiling for rational design of vaccine formulations, administration, and potential protection. In the present study we report the gene expression profiles by RNA-seq followed by functional analysis using whole blood samples from rabbits immunized with a recombinant chimeric protein containing peptides from the MSP4 protein of A. phagocytophilum, which showed satisfactory results in terms of potential protection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression of 720 genes, with 346 genes upregulated and 374 genes downregulated. Overrepresentation of biological and metabolic pathways correlated with immune response, protein signaling, cytoskeleton organization and protein synthesis were found. These changes in gene expression could provide a complete and unique picture of the biological response to the epitope candidate vaccine against A. phagocytophilum in the host.},

 abstract = {Background: Ultra-conserved non-coding elements (UCNEs) are genomic sequences that exhibit \&gt; 95\% sequence identity between humans, mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. Recent findings reported their functional role in cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the DNA methylation modifications of UNCEs in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from different mammal species. Methods: Fifty SCCs from 26 humans, 17 cats, 3 dogs, 1 horse, 1 bovine, 1 badger, and 1 porcupine were investigated. Fourteen feline stomatitis and normal samples from 36 healthy human donors, 7 cats, 5 dogs, 5 horses, 2 bovines and 1 badger were collected as normal controls. Bisulfite next generation sequencing evaluated the DNA methylation level from seven UCNEs (uc.160, uc.283, uc.416, uc.339, uc.270, uc.299, and uc.328). Results: 57/59 CpGs were significantly different according to the Kruskal\&ndash;Wallis test (p \&lt; 0.05) comparing normal samples with SCC. A common DNA hypermethylation pattern was observed in SCCs from all the species evaluated in this study, with an increasing trend of hypermethylation starting from normal mucosa, through stomatitis to SCC. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that UCNEs are hypermethylated in human SCC, and this behavior is also conserved among different species of mammals.},

 abstract = {Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) cover the cuticle of insects and serve as desiccation barrier and as semiochemicals. While the main enzymatic steps of CHC biosynthesis are well understood, few of the underlying genes have been identified. Here we show how exploitation of intrasexual CHC dimorphism in a mason wasp, Odynerus spinipes, in combination with whole-genome sequencing and comparative transcriptomics facilitated identification of such genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of twelve candidate gene orthologs in the honey bee, Apis mellifera, confirmed nine genes impacting CHC profile composition. Most of them have predicted functions consistent with current knowledge of CHC metabolism. However, we found first-time evidence for a fatty acid amide hydrolase also influencing CHC profile composition. In situ hybridization experiments furthermore suggest trophocytes participating in CHC biosynthesis. Our results set the base for experimental CHC profile manipulation in Hymenoptera and imply that the evolutionary origin of CHC biosynthesis predates the arthropods’ colonization of land.},

Here, we compared microglial transcriptomes from young-adult and aged mice housed under germ-free and specific pathogen-free conditions and found that the microbiota influenced aging associated-changes in microglial gene expression. The absence of gut microbiota diminished oxidative stress and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia from the brains of aged mice. Unbiased metabolomic analyses of serum and brain tissue revealed the accumulation of N6-carboxymethyllysine (CML) in the microglia of the aging brain. CML mediated a burst of reactive oxygen species and impeded mitochondrial activity and ATP reservoirs in microglia. We validated the age-dependent rise in CML levels in the sera and brains of humans. Finally, a microbiota-dependent increase in intestinal permeability in aged mice mediated the elevated levels of CML. This study adds insight into how specific features of microglia from aged mice are regulated by the gut microbiota.},

@article{mostafa_genome-wide_2024,
 abstract = {Changing climatic conditions with rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns pose significant challenges to agricultural productivity, particularly for common bean crops. Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial regulators that can mitigate the impact of biotic and abiotic stresses on crop production. The MADS-box TFs family has been implicated in various plant physiological processes, including stress-responsive mechanisms. However, their role in common bean and their response to stressful conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we identified 35 MADS-box gene family members in common bean, with conserved MADS-box domains and other functional domains. Gene duplication events were observed, suggesting the significance of duplication in the evolutionary development of gene families. The analysis of promoter regions revealed diverse elements, including stress-responsive elements, indicating their potential involvement in stress responses. Notably, PvMADS31, a member of the PvMADS-box gene family, demonstrated rapid upregulation under various abiotic stress conditions, including NaCl, polyethylene glycol, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Transgenic plants overexpressing PvMADS31 displayed enhanced lateral root development, root elongation, and seed germination under stress conditions. Furthermore, PvMADS31 overexpression in Arabidopsis resulted in improved drought tolerance, likely attributed to the enhanced scavenging of ROS and increased proline accumulation. These findings suggest that PvMADS31 might play a crucial role in modulating seed germination, root development, and stress responses, potentially through its involvement in auxin and ABA signaling pathways. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential roles of PvMADS-box genes in abiotic stress responses in common bean, offering prospects for crop improvement strategies to enhance resilience under changing environmental conditions.},

@article{muller_snp_2020,
 abstract = {Background
Diet induced weight loss represents an intervention for obesity to prevent associated diseases. However there is considerable inter-individual variation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and plasma miRNA might be contributing factors. We therefore hypothesized that changes in the miRNA pattern during weight loss depend on the SNP genotype.
Methods
Plasma miRNA profiles from 12 patients were determined before and after a three month weight loss intervention by Illumina sequencing. 46 further patients were analyzed by qPCR. SNP genotypes were determined on the Sequenom iPLEX platform.
Results
Samples before and after weight loss were analyzed by miRNA-seq and delta miRNA levels ranked according to p-value. Levels of miRNAs 25, 93 and 106 that are expressed from a common genomic cluster were reduced after weight loss. Those results were substantiated in a qPCR analysis of 46 additional patients. This is in accordance with mouse data showing a functional involvement of this cluster in obesity. Correlation of the changes in miRNA abundance with SNP genotypes revealed a statistical association of all three miRNAs with known obesity susceptibility SNPs.
Conclusion
Diet induced weight loss leads to SNP dependent modulation of miRNAs from the miR 25/93/106 gene cluster in humans.},

We carried out a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) loss-of-function screen for human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) targeting 2098 deregulated genes using a customized algorithm to comprehensively probe the functionality of every resolvable transcriptional start site (TSS). CASP8AP2 was identified as the only hit that significantly affected the viability of all eight screened LUAD cell lines while the viability of non-transformed lung cells was only moderately impacted. Knockdown (KD) of CASP8AP2 induced both autophagy and apoptotic cell death pathways. Systematic expression profiling linked the AP-1 transcription factor to the CASP8AP2 KD-induced cancer cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of AP-1 reverted the CASP8AP2 silencing-induced phenotype. Overall, the tailored CRISPRi screen profiled the impact of over 2000 genes on the survival of eight LUAD cell lines and identified the CASP8AP2 – AP-1 axis mediating lung cancer viability.},

@article{naorem_immunoinformatics_2024,
 abstract = {Dental caries, a persistent oral health challenge primarily linked to Streptococcus mutans, extends its implications beyond dental decay, affecting over 4 billion individuals globally. Despite its historical association with childhood, dental caries often persists into adulthood with prevalence rates ranging from 60 to 90\% in children and 26 to 85\% in adults. Currently, there is a dearth of multiepitope vaccines (MEVs) specifically designed to combat S. mutans. To address this gap, we employed an immunoinformatics approach for MEV design, identifying five promising vaccine candidates (PBP2X, PBP2b, MurG, ATP-F, and AGPAT) based on antigenicity and conservation using several tools including CELLO v.2.5, Vaxign, v2.0, ANTIGENpro, and AllerTop v2.0 tools. Subsequent identification of linear B-cell and T-cell epitopes by SVMTrip and NetCTL/NetMHC II tools, respectively, guided the construction of a MEV comprising 10 Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, 5 Helper T Lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, and 5 linear B-cell epitopes, interconnected by suitable linkers. The resultant MEV demonstrated high antigenicity, solubility, and structural stability. In silico immune simulations showcased the MEV’s potential to elicit robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Molecular docking studies revealed strong interactions between the MEV construct and Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. Remarkably, the MEV–TLR-4 complexes exhibited a low energy score, high binding affinity, and a low dissociation constant. The Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation analysis suggested that MEV–TLR-4 complexes had the highest stability and minimal conformational changes indicating equilibrium within 40 nanosecond time frames. Comprehensive computational analyses strongly support the potential of the proposed MEV to combat dental caries and associated infections. The study’s computational assays yielded promising results, but further validation through in vitro and in vivo experiments is needed to assess its efficacy and safety.},

However, patients gradually develop resistance to this drug, leading to tumor relapse. In our previous study, we have identified lncRNAs that regulate chemoresistance through the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism. In this study, we tried to find FDA-approved drugs against the target proteins of these ceRNA networks through drug repurposing using differential gene expression profiles, which could be used to nullify the effect of lncRNAs and promote the sensitivity of TMZ in GBM. We performed molecular docking and simulation studies of predicted repurposed drugs and their targets. Among the predicted repurposed drugs, we found BMS345541 has a higher binding affinity towards its target protein - FOXG1, making it a more stable complex with FOXG1-DNA. The ADMET analysis of this drug BMS345541 shows a higher half-life and lower cytotoxicity level than other predicted repurposed drugs. Hence, we conjecture that this could be a better drug for increasing the sensitivity of TMZ for treating GBM patients.},

@article{ngo_histone_2022,
 abstract = {Background

Epigenetic modulators have been proposed as promising new drug targets to treat adverse remodeling in heart failure. Here, we evaluated the potential of 4 epigenetic drugs, including the recently developed histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor JS28, to prevent endothelin‐1 induced pathological gene expression in cardiac myocytes and analyzed the chromatin binding profile of the respective inhibitor targets.

Methods and Results

Cardiac myocytes were differentiated and puromycin‐selected from mouse embryonic stem cells and treated with endothelin‐1 to induce pathological gene expression (938 differentially expressed genes, q{\textless}0.05). Dysregulation of gene expression was at least in part prevented by epigenetic inhibitors, including the pan‐BRD (bromodomain‐containing protein) inhibitor bromosporine (290/938 genes), the BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) inhibitor JQ1 (288/938), the broad‐spectrum HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (227/938), and the HDAC6 inhibitor JS28 (210/938). Although the 4 compounds were similarly effective toward pathological gene expression, JS28 demonstrated the least adverse effects on physiological gene expression. Genome‐wide chromatin binding profiles revealed that HDAC6 binding sites were preferentially associated with promoters of genes involved in RNA processing. In contrast, BRD4 binding was associated with genes involved in core cardiac myocyte functions, for example, myocyte contractility, and showed enrichment at enhancers and intronic regions. These distinct chromatin binding profiles of HDAC6 and BRD4 might explain the different effects of their inhibitors on pathological versus physiological gene expression.

Conclusions

In summary, we demonstrated, that the HDAC6 inhibitor JS28 effectively prevented the adverse effects of endothelin‐1 on gene expression with minor impact on physiological gene expression in cardiac myocytes. Selective HDAC6 inhibition by JS28 appears to be a promising strategy for future evaluation in vivo and potential translation into clinical application.},

 abstract = {Previous studies have reported the functional role, biochemical features and synthesis pathway of podophyllotoxin (PTOX) in plants. In this study, we employed combined morphological and molecular techniques to identify an endophytic fungus and extract PTOX derivatives. Based on the analysis of ITS sequences and the phylogenetic tree, the isolate was classified as Penicillium herquei HGN12.1C, with a sequence identity of 98.58\%. Morphologically, the HGN12.1C strain exhibits white colonies, short-branched mycelia and densely packed hyphae. Using PacBio sequencing at an average read depth of 195×, we obtained a high-quality genome for the HGN12.1C strain, which is 34.9 Mb in size, containing eight chromosomes, one mitochondrial genome and a GC content of 46.5\%. Genome analysis revealed 10 genes potentially involved in PTOX biosynthesis. These genes include VdtD, Pinoresinollariciresinol reductase (PLR), Secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SDH), CYP719A23, CYP71BE54, O-methyltransferase 1 (OMT1), O-methyltransferase 3 (OMT3), 2-ODD, CYP71CU and CYP82D61. Notably, the VdtD gene in fungi shares functional similarities with the DIR gene found in plants. Additionally, we identified peltatin, a PTOX derivative, in the HGN12.1C extract. Docking analysis suggests a potential role for the 2-ODD enzyme in converting yatein to deoxypodophyllotoxin. These findings offer invaluable insights into the synthesis mechanism of PTOX in fungi, shedding light on the relationship between host plants and endophytes.},

@article{nogell_structure_2024,
 abstract = {The ribosomal DNA (rDNA), the most abundantly expressed locus in the human genome, is represented by hundreds of units per cell. Each unit includes a 13 kb region containing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and a 30 kb intergenic spacer. The rDNA is transcribed with varying intensity in different units, some of which remain permanently silent. A key mediator of at least one of the silencing pathways is the promoter-associated RNA (pRNA) produced from a 2kb gene situated upstream of the rDNA transcription start site. Recent studies suggest that the sequence variability in mammalian cells may account for the selective transcription of different rDNA units. This thesis is based on the deep sequencing of a pRNA gene fragment and its RNA product. We discovered that a certain single- nucleotide variation, which converts the CCCmotif into CCT, as well as deletions reducing the number of CCCT tandem repeats, were significantly more frequent in the DNA than in the respective transcripts. The results suggest that DNA variations have a direct inhibitory effect on the expression of pRNA and,consequently, an indirect promoting effect on rRNA production. The findings also imply that (CCCT)n /(GGGA)n DNA repeats and the respective (GGGA)n RNA repeats may form triplex structures, facilitating the function of pRNA. Along...},

 abstract = {The LasR quorum sensing system regulates the virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multi-drug resistant pathogen. Mangiferin and related compounds have been found to modulate this system as determined by in silico and in vitro experimental procedures. ZINCPharmer was used to compile a library of over 1000 metabolites that were screened to the top five based on shared pharmacophores and drug-like properties with mangiferin. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (140 ns) showed that ZINC E (− 55.64 ± 2.93 kcal/mol) and ZINC D (− 54.51 ± 2.82 kcal/mol) had significantly lower binding free energy compared to mangiferin-LasR (− 42.24 ± 3.94 kcal/mol) and the reference standard (azithromycin-LasR (− 40.01 ± 6.15 kcal/mol). ZINC D (95.16\%) competed favorably with mangiferin (95.77\%) as potential QS modulators at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations relative to ZINC E (85.07\%) and azithromycin (85.79\%). These observations suggest mangiferin and related lead compounds as potential drug candidates for P. aeruginosa infection management.},

 abstract = {Sengon (Falcataria falcata) is an economically important legume tree widely cultivated in community forests, especially in Java Island. However, attacks of gall rust disease by Uromycladium falcatariae is difficult to manage. Understanding sengon genes expressions when artificially infected with gall rust fungi can help unravel its resistance mechanisms. Total RNA was extracted from sengon seedlings samples inoculated with U. falcatariae fungi at 7, 21, and 35 days after inoculation (DAI) and from the control group. Total RNA sequencing was performed using the PCR-cDNA Sequencing protocol (SQK-PCB109) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The RNA-Seq obtained varies from 1.3 million to 1.9 million total reads. The assembled full-length transcript was constructed using the RATTLE program, resulting in 21,819 transcripts. The TransDecoder program used to define open reading frames (ORFs) generated 2,342 transcripts, of which 34.15\% were 5′prime\_partial, 8.15\% were 3′prime\_partial, 8.5\% were internal, and 49.14\% were complete. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between resistant and susceptible seedlings, found that 1,013 genes that were up-regulated and 1,130 genes that were down-regulated in the resistant lines. The transcriptome data discussed in this article have been deposited in the DDBJ with accession number DRA015681.},

Furthermore, Enterococcus phage vB\_EfaM\_A2 (a member of Herelleviridae that possesses virion associated immunoglobin domains) was found to translocate through the epithelium in the presence and absence of its host bacteria. Phage A2 protected eukaryotic cells by reducing mortality and maintaining the structure of the cell layer structure.

 abstract = {Soil contains a great diversity of microorganisms, including bacteria which are known to be drivers of soil ecosystem functions. This study was aimed at investigating the bacterial communities in bulk and rhizosphere soil of Fusarium wilt-infected plantain (Musa paradisiaca). Physicochemical analysis revealed that electrical conductivity (312 µS/cm), cation exchange capacity (15.62 meq/100g), phosphate (0.16 mg/kg), nitrogen (1.53 mg/kg), moisture (19.45 mg/kg), potassium (1.39 mg/kg), magnesium (0.61 mg/kg), clay (60 \%), and silt (35\%) were higher in bulk soil than rhizosphere soil. The 16S rRNA metagenomic sequences quantified a total of 89341 bacterial taxonomic units from bulk soil which consist of 10 phyla, 13 classes, 16 orders, 18 families, 21 genera, and 19 species. A total of 88034 bacterial taxonomic units which comprised of 9 phyla, 13 classes, 23 orders, 22 families, 26 genera, and 25 species, were found in rhizosphere soil. The most abundant phyla in bulk soil are Actinobacteria (31\%), Proteobacteria (26\%), and Gemmatimonadetes (17\%) Acidobacteria (17\%) and Planctomycetes (3\%) while the prominent phyla in rhizosphere soil are Actinobacteria (63\%) Proteobacteria (24\%), Acidobacteria (7\%) and Planctomycetes (3\%). The major functional profiles of bacterial communities in both bulk and rhizosphere soils are metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, terpenoids, polyketides, cofactors, and xenobiotic degradation. Alpha diversities among the bacterial community were higher in Simpson’s reciprocal index for both bulk and rhizosphere soils. This study opens up new frontiers in expanding metagenomics studies on environmental samples which would capture and contribute to the identification of soil bacteria useful to ecosystem functions.},

This article presents to software engineering researchers the six key challenges that a domain expert faces in addressing their problem with a computational workflow, and the underlying executable implementation. These challenges arise out of our conceptual framework which presents the “route” of transformations that a domain expert may choose to take while developing their solution. To ground our conceptual framework in the state of the practice, this article discusses a selection of available textual and graphical workflow systems and their support for the transformations described in our framework. Example studies from the literature in various domains are also examined to highlight the tools used by the domain experts as well as a classification of the domain specificity and machine learning usage of their problem, workflow, and implementation. The state of the practice informs our discussion of the six key challenges, where we identify which challenges and transformations are not sufficiently addressed by available tools. We also suggest possible research directions for software engineering researchers to increase the automation of these tools and disseminate best-practice techniques between software engineering and various scientific domains.},

 abstract = {The loss of pancreatic β-cell identity has emerged as an important feature of type 2 diabetes development, but the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we explore the cell-autonomous role of the cell-cycle regulator and transcription factor E2F1 in the maintenance of β-cell identity, insulin secretion, and glucose homeostasis. We show that the β-cell–specific loss of E2f1 function in mice triggers glucose intolerance associated with defective insulin secretion, altered endocrine cell mass, downregulation of many β-cell genes, and concomitant increase of non–β-cell markers. Mechanistically, epigenomic profiling of the promoters of these non–β-cell upregulated genes identified an enrichment of bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 or H3K27me3 marks. Conversely, promoters of downregulated genes were enriched in active chromatin H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks. We find that specific E2f1 transcriptional, cistromic, and epigenomic signatures are associated with these β-cell dysfunctions, with E2F1 directly regulating several β-cell genes at the chromatin level. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of E2F transcriptional activity in human islets also impairs insulin secretion and the expression of β-cell identity genes. Our data suggest that E2F1 is critical for maintaining β-cell identity and function through sustained control of β-cell and non–β-cell transcriptional programs.β-Cell–specific E2f1 deficiency in mice impairs glucose tolerance.Loss of E2f1 function alters the ratio of α- to β-cells but does not trigger β-cell conversion into α-cells.Pharmacological inhibition of E2F activity inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and alters β- and α-cell gene expression in human islets.E2F1 maintains β-cell function and identity through control of transcriptomic and epigenetic programs.},

@article{olagoke_rps6_2023,
 abstract = {The use of insects to model molecular events that characterize degenerative conditions was originally met with scepticism. However, the discovery of insect insulin-like peptides in the 1970's and the demonstration of evolutionary conservation of insulin-related signalling from insects to mammals have highlighted the importance and reduced cost of insect models in biomedical research. Here, we expand on our earlier described modelling of streptozotocin-induced brain glucose metabolic disruption in Nauphoeta cinerea, using RNA-sequencing analysis to study the transcriptional and genetic signatures of degeneration and stress signalling when glucose levels are elevated in the brain of the lobster cockroach. Nymphs were randomly divided into three groups: Control (0.8\% NaCl), and two single streptozotocin injection doses (74 nmol and 740 nmol). The transcriptional analyses featured a dysregulation of 226 genes at high dose STZ treatment and 278 genes at the low dose. Our mRNA-sequencing data showed that ribosomal protein genes were the most upregulated genes at both 74 and 740 nmol STZ treatment. We therefore used RT-qPCR and relative transcriptional methods to validate our proposed mechanism of brain glucose toxicity-induced degeneration in Nauphoeta cinerea, which involved the upregulation of ribosomal proteins and rpS6 regulators (mTORC1, protein kinases, casein kinase 1 and Death-associated protein kinase), the upregulation of MAPK cascades (RAS, ERK, P38 and JNK), alongside the downregulation of the PI3K/AKT cascade. Taken together, this study highlights the remarkable opportunity for Nauphoeta cinerea use as an experimental organism in hyperglycaemia, degeneration, and stress signalling.},

 abstract = {The apoplast performs important functions in the plant, such as defense against stress, and compounds present form the apoplastic washing fluid (AWF). The fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of witches' broom disease (WBD) in Theobroma cacao L., initially colonizes the apoplast in its biotrophic phase. In this period, the fungus can remain for approximately 60 days, until it changes to its second phase, causing tissue death and consequently large loss in the production of beans. To better understand the importance of the apoplast in the T. cacao-M. perniciosa interaction, we performed the first apoplastic proteomic mapping of two contrasting genotypes for WBD resistance (CCN51 - resistant and Catongo-susceptible). Based on two-dimensional gel analysis, we identified 36 proteins in CCN-51 and 15 in Catongo. We highlight PR-proteins, such as peroxidases, β-1, 3-glucanases and chitinases. A possible candidate for a resistance marker of the CCN-51 genotype, osmotin, was identified. The antioxidative metabolism of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme showed a significant increase (p{\textless}0.05) in the AWF of the two genotypes under field conditions (FD). T. cacao AWF inhibited the germination of M. perniciosa basidiospores ({\textgreater}80\%), in addition to causing morphological changes. Our results shed more light on the nature of the plant's defense performed by the apoplast in the T. cacao-M. perniciosa interaction in the initial (biotrophic) phase of fungal infection, and therefore make it possible to expand WBD control strategies based on the identification of potential targets for resistance markers and advance scientific knowledge of the disease.},

 abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, RNA-seq datasets were produced to investigate the virus–host relationship. However, much of these data remains underexplored. To improve the search for molecular targets and biomarkers, we performed an integrated analysis of multiple RNA-seq datasets, expanding the cohort and including patients from different countries, encompassing severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Our analysis revealed that severe COVID-19 patients exhibit overexpression of genes coding for proteins of extracellular exosomes, endomembrane system, and neutrophil granules (e.g., S100A9, LY96, and RAB1B), which may play an essential role in the cellular response to infection. Concurrently, these patients exhibit down-regulation of genes encoding components of the T cell receptor complex and nucleolus, including TP53, IL2RB, and NCL. Finally, SPI1 may emerge as a central transcriptional factor associated with the up-regulated genes, whereas TP53, MYC, and MAX were associated with the down-regulated genes during COVID-19. This study identified targets and transcriptional factors, lighting on the molecular pathophysiology of syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.},

 abstract = {Fungi have the potential to colonize soybean seeds in the field, during their maturation in the pods and after harvest, during storage. The aim of this study was to identify fungi inhabiting soybean seeds after storage with varying germination capacity and to evaluate their chemical composition. The research material consisted of twelve soybean seed lots collected from the fields in southern Poland and stored over winter. The germination percentage of these lots ranged between 20.67\% and 81.33\%. The seeds were subjected to analyses of the main chemical components and mycological analysis. Fungal isolates were subjected to taxonomic identification using microscopic methods and DNA sequencing (using internal transcribed spacer region and secondary barcoding regions). A total number of 355 fungal isolates from 16 genera were identified, with Aspergillus, Alternaria, and Fusarium being the most common. Species were successfully identified in 94\% of isolates. Twelve examined seed lots varied significantly in the number of isolated fungal species (from 1 to 17). Moreover, they also differed in the isolated species composition. Highly significant positive correlation was found between the number of Aspergillus psedudoglaucus isolates and the content of free fatty acids. In turn, the number of Fusarium spp. isolates correlated negatively with protein and nitrogen content. Similarly, highly significant negative correlation was found between the number of all fungal isolates and the 1000-seed weight, indicating that smaller seeds are more vulnerable to fungal infection. The results obtained in this study identify species of fungi which may be responsible for lowering quality of the seeds obtained in southern Poland.},

 abstract = {Fungi belonging to the Fusarium genus are commonly isolated from soybean plants and seeds but not all of them are pathogenic. The aim of this study was to compare the pathogenicity among different Fusarium isolates obtained from soybean plants with disease symptoms originating from an experimental field located in the southeast of Poland. Nineteen fungal isolates were selected for the pathogenicity assay, including eight isolates of F. oxysporum, six isolates of F. graminearum, four isolates of F. culmorum and one isolate of F. redolens. Species identification of these isolates was carried out using microscopic methods and sequencing of two genes: translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) and RNA polymerase second largest subunit (RPB2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. redolens being isolated from soybean in Europe. The pathogenicity test was set up by fungal inoculation of healthy soybean seeds of three cultivars: Abelina, Atlanta and Mavka. Symptoms were assessed seven days after inoculation. Disease area percentage of Fusarium inoculated seeds was significantly higher compared to uninoculated control. Nineteen isolates differed in their aggressiveness as the median disease area percentage ranged between 5.0 and 88.0\% depending on isolate. The obtained isolates of four Fusarium species may be used in the future screening of soybean cultivars for resistance to these pathogens.},

@article{ou_differences_2024,
 abstract = {Much of the profound interspecific variation in genome content has been attributed to transposable elements (TEs). To explore the extent of TE variation within species, we developed an optimized open-source algorithm, panEDTA, to de novo annotate TEs in a pangenome context. We then generated a unified TE annotation for a maize pangenome derived from 26 reference-quality genomes, which reveals an excess of 35.1 Mb of TE sequences per genome in tropical maize relative to temperate maize. A small number (n = 216) of TE families, mainly LTR retrotransposons, drive these differences. Evidence from the methylome, transcriptome, LTR age distribution, and LTR insertional polymorphisms reveals that 64.7\% of the variability is contributed by LTR families that are young, less methylated, and more expressed in tropical maize, whereas 18.5\% is driven by LTR families with removal or loss in temperate maize. Additionally, we find enrichment for Young LTR families adjacent to nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) clusters of varying copy number across lines, suggesting TE activity may be associated with disease resistance in maize.},

 abstract = {High-throughput, massively parallel sequence analysis has revolutionized the way that researchers design and execute scientific investigations. Vast amounts of sequence data can be generated in short periods of time. Regarding ophthalmology and vision research, extensive interrogation of patient samples for underlying causative DNA mutations has resulted in the discovery of many new genes relevant to eye disease. However, such analysis remains functionally limited. RNA-sequencing accurately snapshots thousands of genes, capturing many subtypes of RNA molecules, and has become the gold standard for transcriptome gene expression quantification. RNA-sequencing has the potential to advance our understanding of eye development and disease; it can reveal new candidates to improve our molecular diagnosis rates and highlight therapeutic targets for intervention. But with a wide range of applications, the design of such experiments can be problematic, no single optimal pipeline exists, and therefore, several considerations must be undertaken for optimal study design. We review the key steps involved in RNA-sequencing experimental design and the downstream bioinformatic pipelines used for differential gene expression. We provide guidance on the application of RNAsequencing to ophthalmology and sources of open-access eye-related data sets.},

 abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are hotspots for pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and horizontal gene transfer because they receive inflow of nutrient-rich organic wastewater from different sources. In this study, bacterial communities and ARGs of raw (influent) and treated (effluent) sewage samples collected from a WWTP in Northern Mexico were studied using nanopore sequencing technology. Proteobacteria (52.56–61.50\%), Bacteroidetes (8.70–15.58\%), Actinobacteria (7.45–12.86\%), and Firmicutes (2.78–21.27\%) were the major phyla detected in all the sewage samples. The genus Arcobacter (15.36–29.11\%) dominated all the sewage samples, except in the effluent collected in 2022, where more abundance of the genus Shewanella (7.51\%) and Aeromonas (6.12\%) was observed. ARGs classes common to the samples include glycopeptide, bacitracin, macrolide, fluoroquinolone, peptide, tetracycline, and phenicol. The members of the clinically relevant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) group, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium rectale, and Acinetobacter johnsonii with mobile genetic elements carrying ARGs were among the potential human pathogens detected in effluent samples. The release of effluents containing these bacteria or their genomes into the natural environment could have public health implications and aid the spread of ARGs. Better policies and enhanced wastewater treatment strategies are necessary to reduce or eliminate these risks.},

Currently, there is limited information about the genetic background of carbapenem and colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates infecting humans and dogs in Thailand. This study aimed to characterize carbapenem and colistin-resistant genes in six resistant K. pneumoniae clinical isolates (three from humans and three from dogs) which differed in their pulse field gel electrophoresis profiles. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing were employed to identify and analyze the isolates. All six isolates were carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates with chromosomally carried blaSHV, fosA, oqxA and oqxB genes, as well as nine to 21 virulence genes. The isolates belonged to five multilocus sequence types (STs): one isolate from a human and one from a dog belonged to ST16, with the other two human isolates being from ST340 and ST1269 and the other two dog isolates were ST147 and ST15. One human isolate and two dog isolates harbored the same blaOXA-232 gene on the ColKP3 plasmid, and one dog isolate carried the blaOXA-48 gene on the IncFII plasmid. Notably, one human isolate exhibited resistance to colistin mediated by the mcr-3.5 gene carried on the IncFII plasmid, which co-existed with resistance determinants to other antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and quinolones. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive characterization of both chromosome- and plasmid-mediated carbapenem and colistin resistance in a set of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates from unrelated humans and dogs in Thailand. The similarities and differences found contribute to our understanding of the potential widescale dissemination of these important resistance genes among clinical isolates from humans and animals, which in turn may contribute to outbreaks of emerging resistant clones in hospital settings.},

@article{palacios-rodriguez_antimicrobial_2024,
 abstract = {Worldwide, bacterial resistance is one of the most severe public health problems. Currently, the failure of antibiotics to counteract superbugs highlights the need to search for new molecules with antimicrobial potential to combat them. The objective of this research was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 against Gram-negative bacteria. Thirty yeasts and thirty-two Bacillus isolates were tested following the agar well-diffusion method. Four Bacillus sp. strains (BS3, BS4, BS17, and BS21) showed antagonistic activity against E. coli ATCC 25922 using bacterial culture (BC) and the cell-free supernatant (CFS), where the BS4 strain stood out, showing inhibitory values of 20.50 ± 0.70 mm and 19.67 ± 0.58 mm for BC and CFS, respectively. The Bacillus sp. BS4 strain can produce antioxidant, non-hemolytic, and antimicrobial metabolites that exhibit activity against several microorganisms such as Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis. According to the characterization of the supernatant, the metabolites could be proteinaceous. The production of these metabolites is influenced by carbon and nitrogen sources. The most suitable medium to produce antimicrobial metabolites was TSB broth. The one-factor-at-a-time method was used to standardize parameters such as pH, agitation, temperature, carbon source, nitrogen source, and salts, resulting in the best conditions of pH 7, 150 rpm, 28 °C, starch (2.5 g/L), tryptone (20 g/L), and magnesium sulfate (0.2 g/L), respectively. Moreover, the co-culture was an excellent strategy to improve antimicrobial activity, achieving maximum antimicrobial activity with an inhibition zone of 21.85 ± 1.03 mm. These findings position the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 strain as a promising candidate for producing bioactive molecules with potential applications in human health.},

 abstract = {Stomatopods are well studied for their unique visual systems, which can consist of up to 16 different photoreceptor types and 33 opsin proteins expressed in the adults of some species. The light-sensing abilities of larval stomatopods are comparatively less well understood with limited information about the opsin repertoire of these early-life stages. Early work has suggested that larval stomatopods may not possess the extensive light detection abilities found in their adult counterparts. However, recent studies have shown that these larvae may have more complex photosensory systems than previously thought. To examine this idea at the molecular level, we characterized the expression of putative light-absorbing opsins across developmental stages, from embryo to adult, in the stomatopod species Pullosquilla thomassini using transcriptomic methods with a special focus on ecological and physiological transition periods. Opsin expression during the transition from the larval to the adult stage was further characterized in the species Gonodactylaceus falcatus. Opsin transcripts from short, middle, and long wavelength-sensitive clades were found in both species, and analysis of spectral tuning sites suggested differences in absorbance within these clades. This is the first study to document the changes in opsin repertoire across development in stomatopods, providing novel evidence for light detection across the visual spectrum in larvae.},

 abstract = {Investigations of the molecular mechanisms behind detection of short, and particularly ultraviolet, wavelengths in arthropods have relied heavily on studies from insects due to the relative ease of heterologous expression of modified opsin proteins in model organisms like Drosophila. However, species outside of the Insecta can provide information on mechanisms for spectral tuning as well as the evolutionary history of pancrustacean visual pigments. Here we investigate the basis of spectral tuning in malacostracan short wavelength sensitive (SWS) opsins using phylogenetic comparative methods. Tuning sites that may be responsible for the difference between ultraviolet (UV) and violet visual pigment absorbance in the Malacostraca are identified, and the idea that an amino acid polymorphism at a single site is responsible for this shift is shown to be unlikely. Instead, we suggest that this change in absorbance is accomplished through multiple amino acid substitutions. On the basis of our findings, we conducted further surveys to identify spectral tuning mechanisms in the order Stomatopoda where duplication of UV opsins has occurred. Ancestral state reconstructions of stomatopod opsins from two main clades provide insight into the amino acid changes that lead to differing absorption by the visual pigments they form, and likely contribute the basis for the wide array of UV spectral sensitivities found in this order.},

The recently proposed semi-supervised binning method, SemiBin, achieved state-of-the-art binning results in several environments. However, this required annotating contigs, a computationally costly and potentially biased process.We propose SemiBin2, which uses self-supervised learning to learn feature embeddings from the contigs. In simulated and real datasets, we show that self-supervised learning achieves better results than the semi-supervised learning used in SemiBin1 and that SemiBin2 outperforms other state-of-the-art binners. Compared to SemiBin1, SemiBin2 can reconstruct 8.3–21.5\% more high-quality bins and requires only 25\% of the running time and 11\% of peak memory usage in real short-read sequencing samples. To extend SemiBin2 to long-read data, we also propose ensemble-based DBSCAN clustering algorithm, resulting in 13.1–26.3\% more high-quality genomes than the second best binner for long-read data.SemiBin2 is available as open source software at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/ and the analysis scripts used in the study can be found at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin2\_benchmark.},

 abstract = {African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a lethal animal pathogen that enters its host cells through endocytosis. So far, host factors specifically required for ASFV replication have been barely identified. In this study a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in porcine cells indicated that the genes RFXANK, RFXAP, SLA-DMA, SLA-DMB, and CIITA are important for productive ASFV infection. The proteins encoded by these genes belong to the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II), or swine leucocyte antigen complex II (SLA II). RFXAP and CIITA are MHC II-specific transcription factors, whereas SLA-DMA/B are subunits of the non-classical MHC II molecule SLA-DM. Targeted knockout of either of these genes led to severe replication defects of different ASFV isolates, reflected by substantially reduced plating efficiency, cell-to-cell spread, progeny virus titers and viral DNA replication. Transgene-based reconstitution of SLA-DMA/B fully restored the replication capacity demonstrating that SLA-DM, which resides in late endosomes, plays a crucial role during early steps of ASFV infection.},

Here we report a MAU2 variant causing CdLS, a deletion of seven amino acids that impairs the interaction between MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus. Investigating this interaction, we discovered that MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus are largely dispensable for normal cohesin and NIPBL function in cells with a NIPBL early truncating mutation. Despite a predicted fatal outcome of an out-of-frame single nucleotide duplication in NIPBL, engineered in two different cell lines, alternative translation initiation yields a form of NIPBL missing N-terminal residues. This form cannot interact with MAU2, but binds DNA and mediates cohesin loading. Altogether, our work reveals that cohesin loading can occur independently of functional NIPBL/MAU2 complexes and highlights a novel mechanism protective against out-of-frame mutations that is potentially relevant for other genetic conditions.},

Lepidium is one of the largest genera in Brassicaceae, yet, the genus has not been a focus of extensive genomic research. In the present work, garden cress genome was sequenced using the long read high-fidelity sequencing technology. A de novo, draft genome assembly that spans 336.5 Mb was produced, corresponding to 88.6\% of the estimated genome size and representing 90\% of the evolutionarily expected orthologous gene content. Protein coding gene content was structurally predicted and functionally annotated, resulting in the identification of 25,668 putative genes. A total of 599 candidate disease resistance genes were identified by predicting resistance gene domains in gene structures, and 37 genes were detected as orthologs of heavy metal associated protein coding genes. In addition, 4289 genes were assigned as “transcription factor coding.” Six different machine learning algorithms were trained and tested for their performance in classifying miRNA coding genomic sequences. Logistic regression proved the best performing trained algorithm, thus utilized for pre-miRNA coding loci identification in the assembly. Repetitive DNA analysis involved the characterization of transposable element and microsatellite contents. L. sativum chloroplast genome was also assembled and functionally annotated. Data produced in the present work is expected to constitute a foundation for genomic research in garden cress and contribute to genomics-assisted crop improvement and genome evolution studies in the Brassicaceae family.},

 abstract = {Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is the leading cause of vision loss in diseases like proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). A significant failure rate of current treatments indicates the need for novel treatment targets. Animal models are crucial in this process, but current diabetic retinopathy models do not develop RNV. Although the nondiabetic oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model is used to study RNV development, it is largely unknown how closely it resembles human PDR.    We therefore performed RNA sequencing on murine (C57BL/6J) OIR retinas (n = 14) and human PDR RNV membranes (n = 7) extracted during vitrectomy, each with reference to control tissue (n=13/10). Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and associated biological processes were analyzed and compared between human and murine RNV to assess molecular overlap and identify phylogenetically conserved factors.    In total, 213 murine- and 1223 human-specific factors were upregulated with a small overlap of 94 DEG (7\% of human DEG), although similar biological processes such as angiogenesis, regulation of immune response, and extracellular matrix organization were activated in both species. Phylogenetically conserved mediators included ANGPT2, S100A8, MCAM, EDNRA, and CCR7.    Even though few individual genes were upregulated simultaneously in both species, similar biological processes appeared to be activated. These findings demonstrate the potential and limitations of the OIR model to study human PDR and identify phylogenetically conserved potential treatment targets for PDR.},

 abstract = {Genetic abnormalities like Y chromosome microdeletions are implicated in male infertility. This study investigated the association of azoospermia factor (AZF) region microdeletions with unsuccessful assisted reproductive techniques (ART), including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).This cross-sectional analysis study examined 80 Iranian oligospermic men (mean age 34 years) with prior failed ICSI and IVF cycles (IR.IAU.TNB.REC.1401.041). Semen analysis evaluated quantity/quality parameters based on World Health Organization guidelines. Participants were stratified by sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) levels into: control (SDF \&lt; 15\%, n = 20), mild elevation (15\% ≤ SDF ≤ 30\%, n = 60), and high (SDF \&gt; 30\%, n = 20). Multiplex PCR mapped AZF microdeletions in the high SDF group. The AZF-associated genes were selected by RNA Seq analysis, and the candidate genes were checked for expression level by real-time PCR.High SDF individuals exhibited poorer semen metrics, including 69\% lower sperm concentration (P = 0.04) than those without SDF. Of this subset, 45\% (9/20 men) harboured predominately AZF microdeletions. Men with AZF microdeletions showed higher SDF (32\% vs 21\%, P = 0.02) and altered AZF-associated genes expression. As USP9Y 3-fold, UTY 1.3-fold, and BPY2 1-fold revealed up-regulation, while IQCF1 8-fold, CDY 6.5-fold, DAZ 6-fold, and DDX3Y 1-fold underwent down-regulation. The PAWP gene was also down-regulated (5.7-fold, P = 0.029) in the IVF/ICSI failure group.AZF microdeletions significantly impact male infertility and ART outcomes. High SDF individuals exhibited poorer semen metrics, with 45\% AZF microdeletions. These microdeletions altered AZF-associated genes expression, affecting fertility mediator PAWP independently. Dual AZF and SDF screening enables personalized management in severe male infertility, potentially explaining IVF/ICSI failures.},

 abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are often elderly or unfit and thus cannot tolerate standard aggressive therapy regimes. In our study, we test the efficacy of the DNA-hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which has been shown to possess little systemic adverse effects. Screening a broad panel of 56 NSCLC cell lines uncovered a decrease in cell viability after the combination treatment in 77\% of the cell lines. Transcriptomics, proteomics, proliferation and migration profiling revealed that fast proliferating and slowly migrating cell lines were more sensitive to the drug combination. The comparison of mutational profiles found oncogenic KRAS mutations only in sensitive cells. Additionally, different cell lines showed a heterogeneous gene expression response to the treatment pointing to diverse mechanisms of action. Silencing KRAS, RIG-I or RARB partially reversed the sensitivity of KRAS-mutant NCI-H460 cells. To study resistance, we generated two NCI-H460 cell populations resistant to ATRA and DAC, which migrated faster and proliferated slower than the parental sensitive cells and showed signs of senescence. In summary, this comprehensive dataset uncovers a broad sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the combinatorial treatment with DAC and ATRA and indicates that migration and proliferation capacities correlate with and could thus serve as determinants for drug sensitivity in NSCLC.},

Oxidative stress in bacteria is the main reason for bacteria death after exposure to blue light photoexcited quantum dots. Herein, we present the antibacterial activities of hydrophobic carbon quantum dots/polydimethylsiloxane nanocomposites, hydrophilic citric acid CQDs, and combinations of CQDs with methylene blue. We investigated the antirickettsial effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic CQDs against Rickettsia slovaca, a tick-borne bacterial pathogen. Photodynamic activity against on rickettsiae reached 99.66\% using CQDs with 470 nm blue light irradiation. Combining methylene blue with CQDs further enhanced the effect on rickettsial infection, achieving 99,98\% efficacy. The obtained results reveal the in vitro antirickettsial properties of CQDs. Sequencing analysis on the genomic level of control and treated samples showed single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Based on snippy analysis SNVs were assigned to the rRNA genes, 16S rRNA and 30S rRNA genes. By freebayes analysis in treated samples, a stop-lost mutation was detected in pseudogene (RSL\_RS06070), while the possible effect on down-stream genes including tsaD, acyl-CoA-desaturase, 30S ribosomal protein S6 and DUF424 family protein.

 abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a continuum of disorders among which non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is particularly associated with a negative prognosis. Hepatocyte lipotoxicity is one of the main pathogenic factors of liver fibrosis and NASH. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this process are poorly understood. The main aim of this study was to dissect transcriptional mechanisms regulated by lipotoxicity in hepatocytes. We achieved this aim by combining transcriptomic, proteomic and chromatin accessibility analyses from human liver and mouse hepatocytes. This integrative approach revealed several transcription factor networks deregulated by NASH and lipotoxicity. To validate these predictions, genetic deletion of the transcription factors MAFK and TCF4 was performed, resulting in hepatocytes that were better protected against saturated fatty acid oversupply. MAFK- and TCF4-regulated gene expression profiles suggest a mitigating effect against cell stress, while promoting cell survival and growth. Moreover, in the context of lipotoxicity, some MAFK and TCF4 target genes were to the corresponding differentially regulated transcripts in human liver fibrosis. Collectively, our findings comprehensively profile the transcriptional response to lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, revealing new molecular insights and providing a valuable resource for future endeavours to tackle the molecular mechanisms of NASH.},

 abstract = {The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B is implicated in recessive intellectual disability disorders, and heterozygous, protein-truncating variants in KDM5B are associated with reduced cognitive function in the population. The KDM5 family of lysine demethylases has developmental and homeostatic functions in the brain, some of which appear to be independent of lysine demethylase activity. To determine the functions of KDM5B in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we first studied male and female mice homozygous for a Kdm5bΔARID allele that lacks demethylase activity. Kdm5bΔARID/ΔARID mice exhibited hyperactivity and long-term memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks. The expression of immediate early, activity-dependent genes was downregulated in these mice and hyperactivated upon a learning stimulus compared with wild-type (WT) mice. A number of other learning-associated genes were also significantly dysregulated in the Kdm5bΔARID/ΔARID hippocampus. Next, we knocked down Kdm5b specifically in the adult, WT mouse hippocampus with shRNA. Kdm5b knockdown resulted in spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and long-term potentiation deficits. These findings identify KDM5B as a critical regulator of gene expression and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus and suggest that at least some of the cognitive phenotypes associated with KDM5B gene variants are caused by direct effects on memory consolidation mechanisms.},

However, conflicting data from published studies have demonstrated significant transcriptional differences between PDXs and original tumors, challenging the fidelity of these models. We employed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach coupled with generation of patient-specific databases using RNA-seq data to investigate the proteogenomic landscape of serially-passaged PDX models established from two patients with distinct subtypes of ovarian cancer. We demonstrate that the utilization of patient-specific databases guided by transcriptional profiles increases the depth of human protein identification in PDX models. Our data show that human proteomes of serially passaged PDXs differ significantly from their patient-derived tumor of origin. Analysis of differentially abundant proteins revealed enrichment of distinct biological pathways with major downregulated processes including extracellular matrix organization and the immune system. Finally, we investigated the relative abundances of ovarian cancer-related proteins identified from the Cancer Gene Census across serially passaged PDXs, and found their protein levels to be unstable across PDX models. Our findings highlight features of distinct and dynamic proteomes of serially-passaged PDX models of ovarian cancer.},

 abstract = {The recent improvements in mass spectrometry instruments and new analytical methods are increasing the intersection between proteomics and big data science. In addition, bioinformatics analysis is becoming increasingly complex and convoluted, involving multiple algorithms and tools. A wide variety of methods and software tools have been developed for computational proteomics and metabolomics during recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. However, most of the computational proteomics and metabolomics tools are designed as single-tiered software application where the analytics tasks can't be distributed, limiting the scalability and reproducibility of the data analysis. In this paper we summarise the key steps of metabolomics and proteomics data processing, including the main tools and software used to perform the data analysis. We discuss the combination of software containers with workflows environments for large scale metabolomics and proteomics analysis. Finally, we introduce to the proteomics and metabolomics communities a new approach for reproducible and large-scale data analysis based on BioContainers and two of the most popular workflow environments: Galaxy and Nextflow.

 abstract = {Metastasierung und Therapieresistenz stellen die wesentlichen Hindernisse bei der kurativen Behandlung des Kolorektalkarzinoms (KRK) dar und sind Hauptursache für die krebsbedingte Sterblichkeit. Bei etwa einem Viertel der KRK-Patient*innen liegen bei Erstdiagnose Fernmetastasen vor, bei ca. der Hälfte der Erkrankten treten im Verlauf Fernmetastasen auf (Kumbrink et al., 2021; Van Cutsem \& Oliveira, 2009; Vatandoust et al., 2015). 
Fluoropyrimidin-basierte Chemotherapieregime sind das Grundgerüst der systemischen KRK-Therapie, welche durch weitere klassische Zytostatika sowie Antikörper-basierte Wirkstoffe erweitert werden kann. Das Kombinationsschema bestehend aus 5-Fluoruracil, Irinotecan und Leucovorin – syn. FOLFIRI – wird bei metastasiertem KRK (mKRK) als Erst- oder Zweitlinientherapie eingesetzt (Leitlinienprogramm Onkologie (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft, 2019). Trotz der Wirksamkeit dieser Kombinationsbehandlung, durch die die Überlebensrate deutlich verbessert werden konnte, führen intrinsische und erworbene Resistenzmechanismen zur Progression der Krankheit (Jensen et al., 2015; Lyskjær et al., 2019).

Um molekularen Mechanismen und Biomarker der FOLFIRI-Resistenz auf Transkriptomebene zu identifizieren, wurden aus den KRK -Zelllinien Colo205, HT29 und SW480 drei FOLFIRI-resistente Subzelllinien durch kontinuierliche Behandlung mit steigenden FOLFIRI-Konzentrationen hergestellt. Als biologische Effekte der FOLFIRI-Resistenz konnten Änderungen in der Genexpression, morphologische Veränderungen sowie Anpassung des Zellzyklus und Zelltod-Resistenz beobachtet werden. 

Zur Identifikation von resistenz-assoziierten Expressionssignaturen oder potentiell prognostischen Biomarkern wurde eine RNA-Sequenzierung der parentalen sowie der resistenten Zelllinien durchgeführt. 
Insgesamt 284 differentiell exprimierte Gene (DEGs) wurden nach der bioinformatischen Analyse der RNA-Sequenzierung von 24 Proben ermittelt (Colo205: 222 Gene, HT29: 47 Gene, SW480: 30 Gene). Anschließend wurden diese DEGs miteinander abgeglichen und 12 DEGs identifiziert, die in zwei oder allen drei Zelllinien konsistent dysreguliert waren. Mittels Kaplan-Meier (KM-) Überlebenszeitanalyse des Kolon-Adenokarzinom-Datensatz (COAD) des Krebsgenomatlas (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA, PanCancer Atlas Datenset ) wurden hieraus drei prognostisch relevante Gene (TACSTD2, PERP und CAV2) identifiziert, die sich signifikant mit kürzerem Überleben bei KRK assoziiert zeigten. 
Diese Ergebnisse wurden mit den Ergebnissen einer klinischen Studie (GSE62322) abgeglichen. In dieser Studie wurden von 21 Chemotherapie-naiven KRK-Patient*innen Tumorproben entnommen, worauf eine postoperative Chemotherapie mit FOLFIRI folgte. Um eine Gensignatur zu identifizieren, die das Ansprechen auf FOLFIRI vorhersagen soll, wurden im nächsten Schritt die Expressionsdaten der auf FOLFIRI ansprechenden Patient*innen mit denen der nicht auf FOLFIRI ansprechenden Patient*innen verglichen. 
Im Abgleich mit diesen Expressionsdaten konnten die drei Gene TACSTD2, PERP und CAV2 nicht als signifikant dysreguliert bzw. als Teil der Gensignatur nachgewiesen werden. Jedoch konnten die Gene SERPINE2 und TNC aus der Liste aller 284 DEGs in den klinischen Tumorproben ebenfalls als signifikant differentiell exprimiert nachgewiesen werden und mittels KM-Überlebenszeitanalyse als prognostisch relevant eingestuft werden. 
Diese drei bzw. fünf identifizierten Gene können nun Grundlage für weitere experimentelle Schritte sein, um neue diagnostische und prognostische Biomarker für die klinische Praxis zu etablieren.},

 abstract = {Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 70\% of deaths world-wide. Previous work has linked NCDs such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) to disruption of chromatin regulators. However, the exact molecular origins of these chronic conditions remain elusive. Here, we identify the H4 lysine 16 acetyltransferase MOF as a critical regulator of central carbon metabolism. High-throughput metabolomics unveil a systemic amino acid and carbohydrate imbalance in Mof deficient mice, manifesting in T2D predisposition. Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) reveals defects in glucose assimilation and insulin secretion in these animals. Furthermore, Mof deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced fat gain due to defects in glucose uptake in adipose tissue. MOF-mediated H4K16ac deposition controls expression of the master regulator of glucose metabolism, Pparg and the entire downstream transcriptional network. Glucose uptake and lipid storage can be reconstituted in MOF-depleted adipocytes in vitro by ectopic Glut4 expression, PPARγ agonist thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment or SIRT1 inhibition. Hence, chronic imbalance in H4K16ac promotes a destabilisation of metabolism triggering the development of a metabolic disorder, and its maintenance provides an unprecedented regulatory epigenetic mechanism controlling diet-induced obesity.},

TAPscan is a comprehensive and highly reliable tool for genome-wide TAP annotation via domain profiles. Here, we present TAPscan v4, including an updated web interface (https://tapscan.plantcode.cup.uni-freiburg.de/), which enables an in-depth representation of the distribution of 138 TAP families across 678 species from diverse groups of organisms, with a focus on Archaeplastida (plants in the wide sense). With this release, we also make the underlying “Genome Zoo” available, a curated protein data set with scripts and metadata. Eighteen new TAP (sub)families were added as part of the update. Nine of those were gained in the most recent common ancestor of the Streptophyta (comprising streptophyte algae and land plants), or within the streptophyte algae. More than one-third of all detected TAP family gains were identified during the evolution of streptophyte algae, before the emergence of land plants, and are thus likely to have been significant for plant terrestrialization. The TAP complement of the Zygnematophyceae was identified to be the most similar to that of land plants, consistent with the finding that this lineage is sister to land plants. Overall, our data retrace the evolution of streptophyte TAPs, allowing us to pinpoint the regulatory repertoire of the earliest land plants.},

Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) from the food and medicinal plant nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) is known for its antimicrobial activity and is used for the treatment of infections of the draining urinary tract and upper respiratory tract. Against this background, we raised the question of whether a 14 d nasturtium intervention (3 g daily, N = 30 healthy females) could also impact the normal gut microbiota composition. Spot urinary BITC excretion highly correlated with a weak but significant antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli. A significant increase in human beta defensin 1 as a parameter for host defense was seen in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) upon verum intervention. Pre-to-post analysis revealed that mean gut microbiome composition did not significantly differ between groups, nor did the circulating serum metabolome. On an individual level, some large changes were observed between sampling points, however. Explorative Spearman rank correlation analysis in subgroups revealed associations between gut microbiota and the circulating metabolome, as well as between changes in blood markers and bacterial gut species.},

 abstract = {Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are anomalies of the cerebral vasculature. Loss of the CCM proteins CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2, or CCM3/PDCD10 trigger a MAPK-Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) signaling cascade, which induces a pathophysiological pattern of gene expression. The downstream target genes that are activated by KLF2 are mostly unknown. Here we show that Chromobox Protein Homolog 7 (CBX7), component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, contributes to pathophysiological KLF2 signaling during zebrafish cardiovascular development. CBX7/cbx7a mRNA is strongly upregulated in lesions of CCM patients, and in human, mouse, and zebrafish CCM-deficient endothelial cells. The silencing or pharmacological inhibition of CBX7/Cbx7a suppresses pathological CCM phenotypes in ccm2 zebrafish, CCM2-deficient HUVECs, and in a pre-clinical murine CCM3 disease model. Whole-transcriptome datasets from zebrafish cardiovascular tissues and human endothelial cells reveal a role of CBX7/Cbx7a in the activation of KLF2 target genes including TEK, ANGPT1, WNT9, and endoMT-associated genes. Our findings uncover an intricate interplay in the regulation of Klf2-dependent biomechanical signaling by CBX7 in CCM. This work also provides insights for therapeutic strategies in the pathogenesis of CCM.},

@article{phillip_molecular_2023,
 abstract = {Background: There is a growing body of evidence on the potential involvement of coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) in causing urinary tract infections (UTIs). The aim of this study was to delineate virulence potential, antimicrobial resistance genes, and sequence types of CoNS isolated from patients with UTI symptoms and pyuria in Tanzania. Methods: CoNS from patients with UTI symptoms and more than 125 leucocytes/μL were retrieved, subcultured, and whole-genome sequenced. Results: Out of 65 CoNS isolates, 8 species of CoNS were identified; Staphylococcus haemolyticus, n = 27 (41.5\%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, n = 24 (36.9\%), were predominant. The majority of S. haemolyticus were sequence type (ST) 30, with 8 new ST138-145 reported, while the majority of S. epidermidis were typed as ST490 with 7 new ST1184-1190 reported. Sixty isolates (92.3\%) had either one or multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. The most frequently detected resistance genes were 53 (21\%) dfrG, 32 (12.9\%) blaZ, and 26 (10.5\%) mecA genes conferring resistance to trimethoprim, penicillin, and methicillin, respectively. Out of 65 isolates, 59 (90.8\%) had virulence genes associated with UTI, with a predominance of the icaC 47 (46.5\%) and icaA 14 (13.9\%) genes. Conclusion:S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis harboring icaC, dfrG, blaZ, and mecA genes were the predominant CoNS causing UTI in Tanzania. Laboratories should carefully interpret the significant bacteriuria due to CoNS in relation to UTI symptoms and pyuria before labeling them as contaminants. Follow-up studies to document the outcome of the treated patients is needed to add more evidence that CoNS are UTI pathogens.},

M. massiliense has been associated with different oral pathologies and was co-isolated with the Synergistetes bacterium Pyramidobacter piscolens (P. piscolens) in one case of severe periodontitis. Here, reporting on two additional necrotic pulp cases yielded the opportunity to characterise two co-cultivated M. massiliense isolates, both with P. piscolens, as non-motile, 1–2-µm-long and 0.6–0.8-µm-wide Gram-positive coccobacilli which were autofluorescent at 420 nm. The two whole genome sequences featured a 31.3\% GC content, gapless 1,834,388-base-pair chromosome exhibiting an 85.9\% coding ratio, encoding a formate dehydrogenase promoting M. massiliense growth without hydrogen in GG medium. These data pave the way to understanding a symbiotic, transkingdom association with P. piscolens and its role in oral pathologies.},

None of the species in this genus have their mitochondrial genome described, which is highly valuable in phylogenetic and molecular evolution studies. For the present work, eight species from the Neoarius genus were selected: Neoarius utarus, Neoarius midgleyi, Neoarius graeffei, Neoarius leptaspis, Neoarius berenyi, Neoarius paucus, Neoarius pectoralis, and Neoarius aff. graeffei. DNA sequences of the eight species were obtained through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database, and the mitochondrial genomes were assembled using the NOVOplasty tool on the Galaxy platform, subsequently annotated with the MitoAnnotator tool. We then utilized the protein-coding genes from the mitogenomes to estimate the phylogenetic relationships within the group, including seven additional mitogenomes available in the NCBI. In all species, the mitochondrial genomes presented 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and 1 D-loop.},

@article{pinter_functional_2021,
 abstract = {The lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a pivotal role in cellular differentiation by regulating the expression of key developmental genes in concert with different coregulatory proteins. This process is impaired in different cancer types and incompletely understood. To comprehensively identify functional coregulators of LSD1, we established a novel tractable fluorescent reporter system to monitor LSD1 activity in living cells. Combining this reporter system with a state-of-the-art multiplexed RNAi screen, we identify the DEAD-box helicase 19A (DDX19A) as a novel coregulator and demonstrate that suppression of Ddx19a results in an increase of R-loops and reduced LSD1-mediated gene silencing. We further show that DDX19A binds to tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and it regulates gene expression through the removal of transcription promoting R-loops. Our results uncover a novel transcriptional regulatory cascade where the downregulation of genes is dependent on the LSD1 mediated demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). This allows the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to methylate H3K27, which serves as a binding site for DDX19A. Finally, the binding of DDX19A leads to the efficient removal of R-loops at active promoters, which further de-represses LSD1 and PRC2, establishing a positive feedback loop leading to a robust repression of the target gene.},

This enables the web-based analysis of label-free and isobaric labeling proteomics experiments via Galaxy’s graphical user interface on public clouds. MaxQuant and MSstats in Galaxy can be applied in conjunction with thousands of existing Galaxy tools and integrated into standardized, sharable workflows. Galaxy tracks all metadata and intermediate results in analysis histories, which can be shared privately for collaborations or publicly, allowing full reproducibility and transparency of published analysis. To further increase accessibility, we provide detailed hands-on training materials. The integration of MaxQuant and MSstats into the Galaxy framework enables their usage in a reproducible way on accessible large computational infrastructures, hence realizing the foundation for high-throughput proteomics data science for everyone.},

 abstract = {Epidemiological surveillance of animal tuberculosis (TB) based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium bovis has recently gained track due to its high resolution to identify infection sources, characterize the pathogen population structure, and facilitate contact tracing. However, the workflow from bacterial isolation to sequence data analysis has several technical challenges that may severely impact the power to understand the epidemiological scenario and inform outbreak response. While trying to use archived DNA from cultured samples obtained during routine official surveillance of animal TB in Portugal, we struggled against three major challenges: the low amount of M. bovis DNA obtained from routinely processed animal samples; the lack of purity of M. bovis DNA, i.e., high levels of contamination with DNA from other organisms; and the co-occurrence of more than one M. bovis strain per sample (within-host mixed infection). The loss of isolated genomes generates missed links in transmission chain reconstruction, hampering the biological and epidemiological interpretation of data as a whole. Upon identification of these challenges, we implemented an integrated solution framework based on whole genome amplification and a dedicated computational pipeline to minimize their effects and recover as many genomes as possible. With the approaches described herein, we were able to recover 62 out of 100 samples that would have otherwise been lost. Based on these results, we discuss adjustments that should be made in official and research laboratories to facilitate the sequential implementation of bacteriological culture, PCR, downstream genomics, and computational-based methods. All of this in a time frame supporting data-driven intervention.},

Here we present the outcomes of a retrospective observational analysis of the first 100 consecutive cases of personalized BT of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium in 35 hospitals, 29 cities and 12 countries during the period from 1 January 2008 to 30 April 2022. We assessed how often personalized BT produced a positive clinical outcome (general efficacy) and performed a regression analysis to identify functional relationships. The most common indications were lower respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue, and bone infections, and involved combinations of 26 bacteriophages and 6 defined bacteriophage cocktails, individually selected and sometimes pre-adapted to target the causative bacterial pathogens. Clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported for 77.2\% and 61.3\% of infections, respectively. In our dataset of 100 cases, eradication was 70\% less probable when no concomitant antibiotics were used (odds ratio = 0.3; 95\% confidence interval = 0.127–0.749). In vivo selection of bacteriophage resistance and in vitro bacteriophage–antibiotic synergy were documented in 43.8\% (7/16 patients) and 90\% (9/10) of evaluated patients, respectively. We observed a combination of antibiotic re-sensitization and reduced virulence in bacteriophage-resistant bacterial isolates that emerged during BT. Bacteriophage immune neutralization was observed in 38.5\% (5/13) of screened patients. Fifteen adverse events were reported, including seven non-serious adverse drug reactions suspected to be linked to BT. While our analysis is limited by the uncontrolled nature of these data, it indicates that BT can be effective in combination with antibiotics and can inform the design of future controlled clinical trials.

@article{pitt_aquirufa_2025,
 abstract = {Within a citizen science project, 112 freshwater habitats in Austria were sampled to get bacterial cultures belonging to the genus Aquirufa using a strategy for targeted isolation. We focused on these bacteria because they are widespread and represent typical freshwater bacteria and, furthermore, the typic red pigmentation facilitates preselection. Among the 113 obtained Aquirufa strains were HETE-83DT, KTFRIE-69FT, OSTEICH-129VT and PLAD-142S6KT, originating from small ponds and a creek. Phylogenetic reconstructions with 16S rRNA gene sequences and genome-based analyses with amino acid sequences of 501 core genes showed that all four strains belonged to the A. antheringensis branch of the genus Aquirufa. Calculation of whole-genome average nucleotide identity values and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values revealed that they represent in each case a new species. The genome sizes of the four strains were between 2.5 and 2.8 Mbp and the G + C values were between 41.4 and 41.8\%. Like all type strains of the genus Aquirufa, cells were rod-shaped, and liquid cultures and colonies on agar plates were red-pigmented, likely due to carotenoids. All strains except OSTEICH-129VT showed gliding motility on soft agar plates. All strains grew aerobically but only PLAD-142S6KT could grow weakly under anaerobic conditions. We propose here to establish the names Aquirufa esocilacus sp. nov. for strain HETE-83DT (= DSM 118087T = JCM 37094T), Aquirufa originis sp. nov. for KTFRIE-69FT (= DSM 117798T = JCM 37095T), Aquirufa avitistagni for OSTEICH-129VT (= DSM 118088T = JCM 37100T) and Aquirufa echingensis sp. nov. for PLAD-142S6KT (= DSM 117799T = JCM 37096T).},

Strain 1-SAACH-A3T was characterized by a genome size of 3.2 Mbp and a G + C value of 38.4 mol\% and encoded genes predicted for nitrate uptake and nitrous oxide utilization. Strains BAHN-186BT and 2-AUSEE-184A6 were characterized by a genome size of 2.4 Mbp and a G + C value of 42.4 and 42.2 mol\%, respectively, and encoded genes predicted for the light-harvesting rhodopsin system. Calculated whole-genome average nucleotide identity values with Aquirufa type strains resulted in a maximum value of 93.65\% for comparison of strain 1-SAACHT with the type strain of Aquirufa ecclesiirivi, which is slightly under the proposed threshold of species demarcation. The calculated gANI value comparing strains BAHN-186BT and 2-AUSEE-184A6 revealed 95.76\%, thus a value slightly above the threshold. Further analyses revealed that the three new strains represent two new species, proposed here as Aquirufa salirivi sp. nov. with type strain 1-SAACH-A3T (= DSM 117800 T = JCM 37097 T) and Aquirufa novilacunae sp. nov. with type strain BAHN-186BT (= DSM 118143 T = JCM 37099 T). Analyses of 123 publicly available metagenomes and a metagenome of the lake Ausee resulted in no detection of A. salirivi sp. nov. In contrast, A. novilacunae sp. nov. could be detected in 15 water samples of rivers, mainly from Asia, but also from North America and Australia. The analyses suggested that the species occurs in most of these samples in low relative abundance, detections derived from metagenomes of water samples from the river Yangtze in the subtropical zone could be interpreted as occurrence in higher abundances.},

@article{potgieter_metanovo_2023,
 abstract = {Background Microbiome research is providing important new insights into the metabolic interactions of complex microbial ecosystems involved in fields as diverse as the pathogenesis of human diseases, agriculture and climate change. Poor correlations typically observed between RNA and protein expression datasets make it hard to accurately infer microbial protein synthesis from metagenomic data. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic analyses typically rely on focused search sequence databases based on prior knowledge for protein identification that may not represent all the proteins present in a set of samples. Metagenomic 16S rRNA sequencing only targets the bacterial component, while whole genome sequencing is at best an indirect measure of expressed proteomes. Here we describe a novel approach, MetaNovo, that combines existing open-source software tools to perform scalable de novo sequence tag matching with a novel algorithm for probabilistic optimization of the entire UniProt knowledgebase to create tailored sequence databases for target-decoy searches directly at the proteome level, enabling metaproteomic analyses without prior expectation of sample composition or metagenomic data generation and compatible with standard downstream analysis pipelines. Results We compared MetaNovo to published results from the MetaPro-IQ pipeline on 8 human mucosal-luminal interface samples, with comparable numbers of peptide and protein identifications, many shared peptide sequences and a similar bacterial taxonomic distribution compared to that found using a matched metagenome sequence database—but simultaneously identified many more non-bacterial peptides than the previous approaches. MetaNovo was also benchmarked on samples of known microbial composition against matched metagenomic and whole genomic sequence database workflows, yielding many more MS/MS identifications for the expected taxa, with improved taxonomic representation, while also highlighting previously described genome sequencing quality concerns for one of the organisms, and identifying an experimental sample contaminant without prior expectation. Conclusions By estimating taxonomic and peptide level information directly on microbiome samples from tandem mass spectrometry data, MetaNovo enables the simultaneous identification of peptides from all domains of life in metaproteome samples, bypassing the need for curated sequence databases to search. We show that the MetaNovo approach to mass spectrometry metaproteomics is more accurate than current gold standard approaches of tailored or matched genomic sequence database searches, can identify sample contaminants without prior expectation and yields insights into previously unidentified metaproteomic signals, building on the potential for complex mass spectrometry metaproteomic data to speak for itself.},

 abstract = {While prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is produced in human tumor microenvironment (TME), its role therein remains poorly understood. Here, we examine this issue by comparative single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells infiltrating human cancers and syngeneic tumors in female mice. PGE receptors EP4 and EP2 are expressed in lymphocytes and myeloid cells, and their expression is associated with the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and MYC targets, glycolysis and ribosomal proteins (RPs). Mechanistically, CD8+ T cells express EP4 and EP2 upon TCR activation, and PGE2 blocks IL-2-STAT5 signaling by downregulating Il2ra, which downregulates c-Myc and PGC-1 to decrease OXPHOS, glycolysis, and RPs, impairing migration, expansion, survival, and antitumor activity. Similarly, EP4 and EP2 are induced upon macrophage activation, and PGE2 downregulates c-Myc and OXPHOS in M1-like macrophages. These results suggest that PGE2-EP4/EP2 signaling impairs both adaptive and innate immunity in TME by hampering bioenergetics and ribosome biogenesis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.},

 abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae are closely related human pathogens of global concern. The more recently described K. quasipneumoniae shares similar morphological characteristics with K. pneumoniae and is commonly misidentified as this species using traditional laboratory techniques. The vast mobilome in these pathogenic bacteria influences the dissemination of virulence factors in high-risk environments and it is, therefore, critical to monitor strains for developing effective clinical management strategies. Herein, this study utilized Illumina sequencing to characterize the whole genomes of nine clinical K. pneumoniae and one K. quasipneumoniae isolate obtained from patients of 3 major hospitals in Trinidad, West Indies. Reconstruction of the assembled genomes and implementation of several bioinformatic tools revealed unique features such as high pathogenicity islands associated with the isolates. The K. pneumoniae isolates were categorized as classical (n = 3), uropathogenic (n = 5), or hypervirulent (n = 1) strains. In silico multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates were related to several international high-risk genotypes, including sequence types ST11, ST15, ST86, and ST307. Analysis of the virulome and mobilome of these pathogens showed unique and clinically important features including the presence of genes associated with Type 1 and Type 3 fimbriae, the aerobactin and yersiniabactin siderophore systems, the K2 and O1/2, and the O3 and O5 serotypes. These genes were either on or in close proximity to insertion sequence elements, phage sequences, and plasmids. Several secretion systems including the Type VI system and relevant effector proteins were prevalent in the local isolates. This is the first comprehensive study investigating the genomes of clinical K. pneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae isolates from Trinidad, West Indies. The data presented illustrate the diversity of Trinidadian clinical K. pneumoniae isolates as well as significant virulence biomarkers and mobile elements associated with these isolates. Additionally, the genomes of the local isolates will add to global databases and thus can be used in future surveillance or genomic studies in this country and the wider Caribbean region.},

 abstract = {Objectives
Antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is a human pathogen of major global concern due to its ability to cause multiple severe diseases that are often difficult to treat therapeutically. This study aimed to investigate the resistome of local clinical K. pneumoniae isolates.
Methods
Herein, we used a whole genome sequencing approach and bioinformatics tools to reconstruct the resistome of ten clinical K. pneumoniae isolates and one clinical isolate of the closely related Klebsiella quasipneumoniae obtained from patients from three major hospitals in Trinidad, West Indies.
Results
The results of the study revealed the presence of a complex antibiotic-resistant armory among the local isolates with multiple resistance mechanisms involving (i) inactivation of antibiotics, (ii) efflux pumps, (iii) antibiotic target alteration, protection, and replacement against antibiotics, and (iv) altered porin protein that reduced the permeability to antibiotics. Several resistance genes such as blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1B, blaSHV-28, blaKPC-2, oqxA, sul1, tetD, aac(6′)-Ib-cr5, aph(6)-Id, and fosA6, which are known to confer resistance to antibiotics used to treat K. pneumoniae infections. In most cases, the resistance genes were flanked by mobile elements, including insertion sequences and transposons, which facilitate the spread of these genetic features among related organisms.
Conclusion
This is the first comprehensive study to thoroughly investigate the resistome of clinical K. pneumoniae isolates and K. quasipneumoniae from Trinidad, West Indies. These findings suggest that monitoring K. pneumoniae and its genome-wide antibiotic resistance features in clinical strains would be of critical importance for guiding antibiotic stewardship programs and improving regional disease management systems for this pathogen.},

 abstract = {The viral intra-host genetic diversities and interactions with the human genome during decades of persistence remain poorly characterized. In this study, we analyzed the variability and integration sites of persisting viruses in nine organs from thirteen individuals who died suddenly from non-viral causes. The viruses studied included parvovirus B19, six herpesviruses, Merkel cell (MCPyV) and JC polyomaviruses, totaling 127 genomes. The viral sequences across organs were remarkably conserved within each individual, suggesting that persistence stems from single dominant strains. This indicates that intra-host viral evolution, thus far inferred primarily from immunocompromised patients, is likely overestimated in healthy subjects. Indeed, we detected increased viral subpopulations in two individuals with putative reactivations, suggesting that replication status influences diversity. Furthermore, we identified asymmetrical mutation patterns reflecting selective pressures exerted by the host. Strikingly, our analysis revealed non-clonal viral integrations even in individuals without cancer. These included MCPyV integrations and truncations resembling clonally expanded variants in Merkel cell carcinomas, as well as novel junctions between herpesvirus 6B and mitochondrial sequences, the significance of which remains to be evaluated.

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Multicellular organisms coordinate tissue specific response to environmental information via both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. In addition to secreted ligands, secreted small RNAs have recently been reported to regulate gene expression across tissue boundaries. Here we show that the conserved poly-U specific endoribonuclease ENDU-2 is secreted from the soma and taken-up by the germline to ensure germline immortality at elevated temperature in C. elegans. ENDU-2 binds to mature mRNAs and negatively regulates mRNA abundance both in the soma and the germline. While ENDU-2 promotes RNA decay in the soma directly via its endoribonuclease activity, ENDU-2 prevents misexpression of soma-specific genes in the germline and preserves germline immortality independent of its RNA-cleavage activity. In summary, our results suggest that the secreted RNase ENDU-2 transmits environmental information across tissue boundaries and contributes to maintenance of stem cell immortality probably via retaining a stem cell specific program of gene expression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Tanshinone I and tanshinone IIB with anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidative, anti-neoplastic, neuron protective, and heart protective properties are valuable active components in it. However, the biosynthetic pathway of tanshinone IIB and tanshinone I has not been completely elucidated. Here, we identified a tanshinone IIA 19-hydroxylase from S. miltiorrhiza. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that SmCYP71D373 could hydroxylate tanshinone IIA at C-19 position to produce tanshinone IIB. Reaction conditions optimization demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of SmCYP71D373 was the highest using the substrate-feeding method under the following conditions, fed the tanshinone IIA into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing codon-optimized SmCYP71D373 at 28℃ for 24 hours. And the yield of tanshinone IIB was up to 6.38\%. Furthermore, N121 and S210 of SmCYP71D373 were verified as the key amino acid residues responsible for its catalytic activity for tanshinone IIA by molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis. The results not only lay a foundation for the elucidation of tanshinone I synthesis pathway, but also provide the theoretical support to improve the catalytic efficiency of SmCYP71D373 for tanshinone IIB production.},

 abstract = {The discovery of antibiotics has radically changed the treatment of bacterial infections, making the increasing antibiotic resistance one of the top ten greatest threats to the global health. The main focus of antibiotic resistance research has, until recently, been focused on clinical settings and human and veterinary aspects. It has become more evident that the environment plays a vital role in the evolution, dissemination and prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes. Aquatic ecosystems are a known mixing ground for clinical and environmental bacteria and can be a source and reservoir for resistance genes. The transfer of resistance between environmental and clinically important bacteria occurs, and surveillance of the environment is therefore important to better understand this flow of resistance.

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in aquatic environments in Ås and Nordre Follo municipalities in Norway. Water samples were collected from three different locations was filtered and plated out on Brilliance™ ESBL and CRE chromogenic agar plates selecting for Extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing and carbapenem resistant bacteria. Bacterial colonies were isolated, and DNA was extracted, followed by 16S PCR and identification by Sanger sequencing. Multiplex and Singelplex PCR with ESBL-specific primers were utilized to screen for specific ESBL-genes, which were confirmed by sequencing. Selected bacterial strains were chosen for antimicrobial susceptibility testing using five different classes of antibiotics. Illumina MiSeq was utilized for whole genome sequencing (WGS) for three selected bacteria, followed by screening for antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, multidrug efflux pumps and metal resistance genes. Several bacteria genera were detected by selective agar plates and identified by 16S rRNA, including the genera Pseudomonas, Serratia, Herbaspirillum, Aeromonas, Shewanella, Chitinophaga and Pandoraea. The susceptibility testing revealed a high amount of resistance to Penicillins and four different Multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates. The bacteria showing the highest amount of resistance was Pandoraea sp., which demonstrated clinical resistance to five out of seven antibiotics tested. The screening for resistance in the three WGS bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chitinophaga silvatica and Pandoraea sp., revealed several β-lactamases. This included the class D β-lactamases blaOXA-50, blaOXA-158 and two bla genes, and the class C β-lactamases blaPDC-202 and blaPAO. Several genes conferring metal resistance and genes for multidrug efflux pumps were also discovered. Together, the results obtained in this work indicate an occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes, including several blaOXA-variants, in the aquatic environments in Ås and Nordre-Follo municipalities.},

A key aspect to providing care for those with COVID-19 and checking its further spread is early and accurate diagnosis of infection, which has been generally done via methods for amplifying and detecting viral RNA molecules. Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting; many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples. However, evidence suggests that some viral peptides could serve as better indicators of COVID-19 infection status than others, due to potential misidentification of peptides derived from human host proteins, poor spectral quality, high limits of detection etc.},

 abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus thrives at animal-human-environment interfaces. A large-scale work from our group indicated that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in commensal S. aureus strains from wild ungulates is associated with agricultural land cover and livestock farming, raising the hypothesis that AMR genes in wildlife strains may originate from different hosts, namely via exchange of mobile genetic elements (MGE). In this work, we generate the largest available dataset of S. aureus draft genomes from wild ungulates in Portugal and explore their mobilome, which can determine important traits such as AMR, virulence, and host specificity, to understand MGE exchange. Core genome multi-locus sequence typing based on 98 newly generated draft genomes and 101 publicly available genomes from Portugal demonstrated that the genomic relatedness of S. aureus from wild ungulates assigned to livestock-associated sequence types (ST) is greater compared to wild ungulate isolates assigned to human-associated STs. Screening of host specificity determinants disclosed the unexpected presence in wildlife of the immune evasion cluster encoded in φSa3 prophage, described as a human-specific virulence determinant. Additionally, two plasmids, pAVX and pETB, previously associated with avian species and humans, respectively, and the Tn553 transposon were detected. Both pETB and Tn553 encode penicillin resistance through blaZ. Pangenome analysis of wild ungulate isolates shows a core genome fraction of 2133 genes, with isolates assigned to ST72 and ST3224 being distinguished from the remaining by MGEs, although there is no reported role of these in adaptation to wildlife. AMR related gene clusters found in the shell genome are directly linked to resistance against penicillin, macrolides, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides, and they represent mobile ARGs. Altogether, our findings support epidemiological interactions of human and non-human hosts at interfaces, with MGE exchange, including AMR determinants, associated with putative indirect movements of S. aureus among human and wildlife hosts that might be bridged by livestock.},

This paper describes the resource credential, or secrets, management service in Custos that allows science gateways to safely manage security tokens, SSH keys, and passwords on behalf of users. Science gateways such as Galaxy are well-established mechanisms for researchers to access cyberinfrastructure and, increasingly, couple it with other online services, such as user-provided storage or compute resources. To support this use case, science gateways need to operate on behalf of the users to connect, acquire, and release these resources, which are protected by a variety of authentication and access mechanisms. Storing and managing the credentials associated with these access mechanisms must be done using “best of breed” software and established security protocols. The Custos Secrets Service allows science gateways to store and retrieve these credentials using secure protocols and APIs while the data is protected at rest. Here, we provide implementation details for the service, describe the available APIs and SDKs, and discuss integration with Galaxy as a use case.},

 abstract = {Continuous vision loss due to vasoproliferative eye disease still represents an unsolved issue despite anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. The impact of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling on retinal angiogenesis and its potential use as a therapeutic target remain controversial. In vitro, oncostatin M (OSM), as a strong STAT3 activator, possesses robust proangiogenic activity. This study investigated to what extent the proangiogenic effects of OSM translate to the in vivo setting of vasoproliferative eye disease.    The in vitro effect of OSM on endothelial cells was investigated in the spheroid sprouting assay and through RNA sequencing. The mouse model for oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) was used to evaluate the impact of OSM in vivo. Signaling patterns were measured by western blot and retinal cryosections. Primary Müller cell cultures were used to evaluate the effect of OSM on the Müller cell secretome. Murine retinal vascular endothelial cells were isolated from OIR retinas using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and were used for RNA sequencing.    Although OSM induced pro-angiogenic responses in vitro, in the OIR model intravitreal injection of OSM reduced retinal neovascularization by 65.2\% and vaso-obliteration by 45.5\% in Müller cells. Injecting OSM into the vitreous activated the STAT3 signaling pathway in multiple retinal cell types, including Müller cells. In vitro, OSM treatment increased CXCL10 secretion. RNA sequencing of sorted vascular endothelial cells at OIR P17 following OSM treatment indicated downregulation of angiogenesis- and mitosis-associated genes.    In vivo, OSM reveals a beneficial angiomodulatory effect by activating Müller cells and changing their secretome. The data highlight contradictions between cytokine-induced effects in vitro and in vivo depending on the cell types mediating the effect.},

@article{rapp_stat3_2023,
 abstract = {Aberrant angiogenesis is a hallmark of cardiovascular and retinal neovascular disease. The STAT3 signaling pathway represents a potential pharmacological target for these diseases due to its impact on angiogenesis. Surprisingly, some STAT3 activators, such as the IL-6 cytokine family member oncostatin M (OSM), enhance angiogenesis, whereas others, such as ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), reduce it. This study aimed to clarify these conflicting effects. In contrast to the anti-angiogenic cytokine CNTF, the pro-angiogenic cytokine OSM was able to activate intracellular signaling pathways beyond the STAT3 pathway, including the ERK and AKT pathways. These differences translated into transcriptomic and metabolic shifts. siRNA-mediated STAT3 knockdown experiments showed a decrease in VEGF-induced endothelial migration and sprouting, enhancing the pro-angiogenic drive of OSM and switching the CNTF response from anti-angiogenic to pro-angiogenic. These effects correlated with a transcriptomic shift representing enhanced STAT1 and ERK activity following STAT3 knockdown, including a compensatory prolonged phosphorylated STAT1 activity. In conclusion, the angiogenic effect of STAT3 appears to be determined by cytokine-induced STAT3 specificity and simultaneous activity of other intracellular signaling pathways, whereas the STAT3 pathway, predominantly recognized for its pro-angiogenic phenotypes, reveals novel anti-angiogenic potential.},

@article{rasche_training_2020,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Hands-on training, whether it is in Bioinformatics or other scientific domains, requires significant resources and knowledge to setup and run. Trainers must have access to infrastructure that can support the sudden spike in usage, with classes of 30 or more trainees simultaneously running resource-intensive tools. For efficient classes, the jobs must run quickly, without queuing delays, lest they disrupt the timetable set out for the class. Often times this is achieved via running on a private server where there is no contention for the queue, and therefore no or minimal waiting time. However, this requires the teacher or trainer to have the technical knowledge to manage compute infrastructure, in addition to their didactic responsibilities. This presents significant burdens to potential training events, in terms of infrastructure cost, person-hours of preparation, technical knowledge, and available staff to manage such events. Findings: Galaxy Europe has developed Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS) which we provide to the scientific commnuity as a service built on top of the Galaxy Platform. Training event organisers request a training and Galaxy administrators can allocate private queues specifically for the training. Trainees are transparently placed in a private queue where their jobs run without delay. Trainers access the dashboard of the TIaaS Service and can remotely follow the progress of their trainees without in-person interactions. Conclusions: TIaaS on Galaxy Europe provides reusable and fast infrastructure for Galaxy training. The instructor dashboard provides visibility into class progress, making in-person trainings more efficient and remote training possible. In the past 24 months, \$\&gt;110\$ trainings with over 3000 trainees have used this infrastructure for training, across scientific domains, all enjoying the accessibility and reproducibility of Galaxy for training the next generation of bioinformaticians. TIaaS itself is an extension to Galaxy which can be deployed by any Galaxy administrator to provide similar benefits for their users. https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The gut microbiota's composition varies significantly between individuals, influenced by factors such as diet, age, genetics, geographical location, and overall health status. Advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools have facilitated comprehensive profiling of the gut microbiome, enabling researchers to explore the intricate relationships between specific microbial taxa and their functions. The gut microbiota's influence extends beyond the gastrointestinal tract, impacting various physiological processes, including metabolism, neurodevelopment, and even mental health. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition, has been associated with various health conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, diabetes, and allergies. In conclusion, metagenomic analysis of the human gut microbiota has revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world residing within us. This research has paved the way for personalized approaches to healthcare, such as targeted dietary interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation, and the development of novel therapeutics aimed at modulating the gut microbiota to promote health and combat disease.

Here, we identify the transcription factors Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as novel regulators of alveolar macrophages (AMs)?a population that provides the first line of immune defense and executes homeostatic functions in lung alveoli. In the absence of these factors, AMs exhibited decreased proliferation that resulted in a severe disadvantage of knockout AMs in a competitive setting. Gene expression analyses revealed a broad cell-intrinsic footprint of Bhlhe40/Bhlhe41 deficiency manifested by a downregulation of AM signature genes and induction of signature genes of other macrophage lineages. Genome-wide characterization of Bhlhe40 DNA binding suggested that these transcription factors directly repress the expression of lineage-inappropriate genes in AMs. Taken together, these results identify Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as key regulators of AM self-renewal and guardians of their identity.},

Intriguingly, several key positive regulators of the GC reaction are common for both cell types. Here, we report that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 is a crucial cell-intrinsic negative regulator affecting both the B and T cell sides of the GC reaction. In activated CD4 T cells, Bhlhe40 was required to restrain proliferation thus limiting the number of T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells. In B cells, Bhlhe40 executed its function in the first days after immunization by selectively restricting the generation of the earliest GC B cells but not of early memory B cells or plasmablasts. Conditional Bhlhe40 inactivation confirmed cell-autonomous functions of Bhlhe40 in both GC B and T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells, while the GC phenotype was further enhanced upon loss of Bhlhe40 in both cell types. This negative regulation of the GC reaction by Bhlhe40 was of crucial importance, as Bhlhe40-deficient mice with progressing age succumbed to a B cell lymphoma characterized by accumulation of monoclonal GC B-like cells and polyclonal T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ cells in various tissues.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, a key player in the pathogenesis of CVD has been less successful due to its role in other coexisting diseases. Additionally, it is the only organelle with an agathokakological function that is a remedy and a poison for the cell. In this review, we describe the origins of cardiac mitochondria and the role of heteroplasmy and mitochondrial subpopulations namely the interfibrillar, subsarcolemmal, perinuclear, and intranuclear mitochondria in maintaining cardiac function and in disease-associated remodeling. The cumulative evidence of mitochondrial retrograde communication with the nucleus is addressed, highlighting the need to study the genotype-phenotype relationships of specific organelle functions with CVD by using approaches like genome-wide association study (GWAS). Finally, we discuss the practicality of computational methods combined with single-cell sequencing technologies to address the challenges of genetic screening in the identification of heteroplasmy and contributory genes towards CVD.},

 abstract = {Humane Papillomviren (HPV) infizieren Keratinozyten der Haut- und Schleimhaut. Die Hochrisiko-Typen (HR) der alpha-Gattung verursachen dadurch anogenitalen- und oropharyngalen-Krebs. Vorherrschend dabei ist das Zervixkarzinom, welches zu 70 \% von HPV16 und HPV18 ausgelöst wird. Im Gegensatz dazu sind die onkogenen Eigenschaften der beta-HPV Gattung weniger gut erforscht. Bei Patienten mit der seltenen Erbkrankheit Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV) und Organtransplantatempfängern (OTRs) wird ein Zusammenhang zwischen beta-HPV-Infektionen und der Entstehung von kutanen Plattenepithelkarzinomen vermutet. Bisher wurden die Eigenschaften von beta-HPV vor allem durch retrovirale Expression der E6 und E7 Onkogene in Keratinozyten, durch Transfektion der Osteosarkomzelllinie U2OS mit beta-HPV Genomen und in transgenen Mausmodellen untersucht, aber nicht mit vollständigen viralen Genomen in normalen humanen Keratinozyten (NHK), den natürlichen Zielzellen. Im Rahmen meiner Dissertation konnte ich zeigen, dass HPV8-, 38- und 49-Genome in humanen Keratinozyten mindestens neun Tage lang transkriptionell aktiv sind und replizieren. Durch Inaktivierung des viralen E8{\textasciicircum}E2 Repressors (E8-/E8{\textasciicircum}E2-) erhält das HPV49 Genom die Fähigkeit NHK zu immortalisieren. Die immortalisierten HPV49 E8- Zelllinien enthalten große Mengen an episomalen Virusgenomen und viralen Transkripten und behalten diese in Kultur über einen langen Zeitraum. Nicht nur der Verlust der E6 und E7 Onkogene, sondern auch eine Inaktivierung der E1 oder E2 Replikationsgene verhindern die Immortalisierung. Die E8-/E1- und E8-/E2- Genome zeigen deutlich niedrigere E6 und E7 Transkriptmengen in transienten Experimenten. Dies legt nahe, dass für die Immortalisierung eine starke E6 und E7 Expression von extrachromosomalen Virusgenomen erforderlich ist. Die Notwendigkeit für eine Inaktivierung von E8 im Kontext von intakten E1 und E2 Genen für die Immortalisierung von NHK zeigt, dass E8{\textasciicircum}E2 eine wichtige Rolle bei der Kontrolle der Onkogenität von beta-HPV spielen könnte, und weist auf grundlegende Unterschiede zwischen HPV49 und HR-HPV Genomen hin. 
Durch RNA-Sequenzierung der HPV49 E8- positiven Zelllinien konnten bekannte Spleißverknüpfungen bestätigt, das frühe Polyadenylierungssignal lokalisiert und Hinweise auf unterschiedliche virale Promotoren erhalten werden. Außerdem wurden neue Spleißverbindungen kartiert und ein neuer Spleißdonor im E6 Gen funktionell untersucht. Dieser beeinflusst die Menge an E6 Protein und vermutlich dadurch die Immortalisierung durch das HPV49 E8- Genom. 
Bei HPV8 und 38 konnten auch durch Inaktivierung von E8{\textasciicircum}E2 keine immortalisierten Zelllinien erzeugt werden, obwohl ähnliche Mengen an Transkripten für die E6 und E7 Onkogene wie bei HPV49 E8- Genomen transkribiert wurden. Dies legt nahe, dass beta-HPV Genome unterschiedliche onkogene Eigenschaften besitzen. Die Inaktivierung der Replikationsgene E1 und E2 reduzierte die Transkription aller untersuchten beta-HPV in NHK, was nahelegt, dass auch WT Genome aktiv replizieren. Die Kultivierung von HPV8- oder 38-transfizierten NHKs in organotypischen Modellen, die die Analyse des produktiven Replikationszyklus von HR-HPV ermöglichen, induziert Transkripte für das L1 Kapsidgen, was nahelegt, dass der produktive Lebenszyklus eingeleitet wurde. Außerdem ähnelt das HPV8-Transkriptionsmuster in organotypischen Kulturen dem einer HPV8-positiven EV-Läsion. 
Zusammengefasst bedeutet dies, dass NHK ein physiologisch relevantes System sind, um die Replikation und onkogenen Eigenschaften von beta-HPV zu untersuchen.},

 abstract = {IntroductionTheobroma cacao, the cocoa tree, is a target for pathogens, such as fungi from the genera Phytophthora, Moniliophthora, Colletotrichum, Ceratocystis, among others. Some cacao pathogens are restricted to specific regions of the world, such as the Cacao swollen shoot virus (CSSV) in West African countries, while others are expanding geographically, such as Moniliophthora roreri in the Americas. M. roreri is one of the most threatening cacao pathogens since it directly attacks the cacao pods driving a significant reduction in production, and therefore economic losses. Despite its importance, the knowledge about the microenvironment of this pathogen and the cocoa pods is still poorly characterized.MethodsHerein we performed RNA sequencing of spores in differential stages of culture in a medium supplemented with cacao pod extract and mycelium collected of the susceptible variety ICT 7121 naturally infected by the pathogen to evaluate the diversity and transcriptional activity of microorganisms associated with the in vitro sporulation of M. roreri.ResultsOur data revealed a great variety of fungi and bacteria associated with M. roreri, with an exceptional diversity of individuals from the genus Trichoderma sp. Interestingly, the dynamics of microorganisms from different kingdoms varied proportionally, suggesting they are somehow affected by M. roreri culture time. We also identified three sequences similar to viral genomes from the Narnaviridae family, posteriorly confirmed by phylogenetic analysis as members of the genus Narnavirus. Screening of M. roreri public datasets indicated the virus sequences circulating in samples from Ecuador, suggesting a wide spread of these elements. Of note, we did not identify traces of the viral sequences in the M. roreri genome or DNA sequencing, restricting the possibility of these sequences representing endogenized elements.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of viruses infecting the fungus of the genus Moniliophthora and only the third description of viruses that are able to parasite elements from the Marasmiaceae family.},

The Center for Genomic Epidemiology and Galaxy platforms were used to determine antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence genes, plasmid typing, mobile genetic elements, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pathogenicity prediction. In total, 19 known MLST groups were detected among the 61 isolates. Phylogroup B1 (ST58) and Phylogroup E (ST9583) were the most common sequence types. The six ST10 (serotype O101:H9) isolates carried the most resistance genes, spanning eight antibiotic classes. Overall, 95.1\% of the isolates carried resistance genes from three or more classes. The blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, and blaCTX-M-15 ESBL genes were associated with mobile genetic elements, and all of the E. coli isolates showed a {\textgreater}90\% predicted probability of being a human pathogen. This study provided novel genomic information on environmental multidrug-resistant ESBL-producing E. coli from fresh produce and irrigation water, highlighting the environment as a reservoir for multidrug-resistant strains and emphasizing the need for ongoing pathogen surveillance within a One Health context.},

 abstract = {Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in the development of flies, fish, frogs and mammals depends on pioneer-like transcription factors (TFs). Those TFs create open chromatin regions, promote histone acetylation on enhancers, and activate transcription. Here, we use the panel of single, double and triple mutants for zebrafish genome activators Pou5f3, Sox19b and Nanog, multi-omics and mathematical modeling to investigate the combinatorial mechanisms of genome activation. We show that Pou5f3 and Nanog act differently on synergistic and antagonistic enhancer types. Pou5f3 and Nanog both bind as pioneer-like TFs on synergistic enhancers, promote histone acetylation and activate transcription. Antagonistic enhancers are activated by binding of one of these factors. The other TF binds as non-pioneer-like TF, competes with the activator and blocks all its effects, partially or completely. This activator-blocker mechanism mutually restricts widespread transcriptional activation by Pou5f3 and Nanog and prevents premature expression of late developmental regulators in the early embryo.},

Carbohydrate metabolism was unexpectedly limited, and instead a key activity was metabolism of extractives. Resin acid degradation was principally linked to community diversification with specific bacteria revealed to dominate the process. Metagenome-guided isolation facilitated the recovery of the dominant enrichment strain in pure culture, which represents a new species (Pseudomonas abieticivorans sp. nov.), that can grow on resin acids as a sole carbon source. Our results illuminate key stages in degradation of an abundant renewable resource, and how defensive extractive compounds have major roles in shaping microbiomes.},

This process responds to environmental cues to maintain optimal fertility despite climatic changes.

Combinations of the double and triple bHLH10,89,91 mutants were analysed under normal (200 μmol m–2 s–1) and low (50 μmol m–2 s–1) light conditions to determine the impact on fertility. Transcriptomic analysis of a new conditionally sterile bhlh89,91 double mutant shows differential regulation of genes related to sexual reproduction, hormone signal transduction, and lipid storage and metabolism under low light. Here we have shown that bHLH89 and bHLH91 play a role in regulating fertility in response to light, suggesting that they function in mitigating environmental variation to ensure fertility is maintained under environmental stress.},

@article{rodrigues_alves_barbosa_phenotypic_2024,
 abstract = {Essential genes are deemed crucial for survival and/or reproductive success, hence, their loss of function leads to lethality. However, gene essentiality is not static, but dependent on multiple factors, including the genetic background. The genetic background affects gene essentiality through genetic modifiers, second-site variants capable of interacting with the primary variant and altering phenotype. Genetic modifiers can act as suppressors, alleviating the phenotype, or enhancers, exacerbating the phenotype. The plasticity (modification) of gene essentiality caused by genetic modifiers has been shown in multiple species. In Caenorhabditis elegans, recent evidence shows phenotypic variability for knock-down of essential genes in two natural isolates: N2 and CB4856. N2 represents the laboratory-cultivated strain, while CB4856 is one of the strains with most diverse genome in comparison to N2. Much has been explored for these two genetic backgrounds, but little is known about the plasticity of gene essentiality in other C. elegans wild isolates. Thus, I here explore the effect of the genetic background on the plasticity of two genes, known as essential in the N2 background, but potentially dispensable in CB4856: the Metaphase-to-Anaphase Transition Defect gene (mat-1), and the Conserved Germline Helicase (cgh-1). These are involved in cell division and posttranscriptional regulation, respectively. Here, I further investigate the plasticity of mat-1 and cgh-1 in N2 and CB4856 backgrounds, and also include four other wild isolate backgrounds from diverse geographical locations (GXW1, KR314, JU1400, and AB1). Using hatch rate and propagation assays, I explored the phenotype of mat-1 and cgh-1 knockdowns across the six natural isolates using temperature-sensitive alleles and uncovered phenotypic variability for the embryonic lethal phenotype, suggestively due to influence of each genetic background. Next, bioinformatics and genomics tools were utilized for identification of candidate genetic modifiers for mat-1 and cgh-1 and led to prioritization of eight extragenic variants. Out of these, none showed notable modifying activity when studied in isolation. Importantly, this work shows the challenges associated with identifying true genetic modifiers in genomes with substantial variation. Undeniably, understanding more about a gene and its phenotype under different conditions and genetic backgrounds may be fundamental for elucidating fixed and plastic genetic interactions.},

using a Sanger sequencing 16s rRNA metagenomics approach. Adult 
females of Culicoides reevesi were collected by human landing catches 
in the rainy season of 2023 and morphologically identified. They were 
grouped into pools of 25 individuals from which genomic DNA (gDNA) was 
extracted. Sanger sequencing of 16S rRNA was performed for a total of 
4 pools, and the amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region 
was done on Illumina Mseq platform to detect bacterial communities. The 
bioinformatic analysis included quality assessment, taxonomic classification, 
and visualization. The evaluation of the microbial community involved 
assessing taxa abundance and diversity using Mothur and QIIME2 software 
included in Galaxy Tool Shed (https://usegalaxy.eu/). Our study presents, 
for the first time in México and worldwide, an in-depth analysis of the

particularly Proteobacteria, alongside varying abundances of Actinobacteria, 
Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidota, with a notable occurrence 
of Tenericutes. We identified intriguing species of both human and animal 
pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, we observed the absence of unidentified 
bacterial sequences, alongside the presence of other bacterial groups 
associated with the environment or plants. This has implications for both 
healthcare and ecological management, potentially simplifying control 
measures but also posing risks if the dominant species are harmful. This 
research enhances our understanding of the microbiome associated with

 abstract = {Glomerular disease due to podocyte malfunction is a major factor in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease. Identification of podocyte-specific signaling pathways is therefore a prerequisite to characterizing relevant disease pathways and developing novel treatment approaches. Here, we employed loss of function studies for EPB41L5 (Yurt) as a central podocyte gene to generate a cell type-specific disease model. Loss of Yurt in fly nephrocytes caused protein uptake and slit diaphragm defects. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of human EPB41L5 knockout podocytes demonstrated impaired mechanotransduction via the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway. Further analysis of specific inhibition of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcription factor complex by TEADi led to the identification of ARGHAP29 as an EPB41L5 and YAP/TAZ-dependently expressed podocyte RhoGAP. Knockdown of ARHGAP29 caused increased RhoA activation, defective lamellipodia formation, and increased maturation of integrin adhesion complexes, explaining similar phenotypes caused by loss of EPB41L5 and TEADi expression in podocytes. Detection of increased levels of ARHGAP29 in early disease stages of human glomerular disease implies a novel negative feedback loop for mechanotransductive RhoA—YAP/TAZ signaling in podocyte physiology and disease.},

 abstract = {Unintegrated HIV DNA represents between 20\% and 35\% of the total viral DNA in infected patients. Only the linear forms (unintegrated linear DNAs [ULDs]) can be substrates for integration and for the completion of a full viral cycle. In quiescent cells, these ULDs may be responsible for pre-integrative latency. However, their detection remains difficult due to the lack of specificity and sensitivity of existing techniques. We developed an ultra-sensitive, specific, and high-throughput technology for ULD quantification called DUSQ (DNA ultra-sensitive quantification) combining linker-mediated PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) using molecular barcodes. Studying cells with different activity levels, we determined that the ULD half-life goes up to 11 days in resting CD4+ T cells. Finally, we were able to quantify ULDs in samples from patients infected with HIV-1, providing a proof of concept for the use of DUSQ in vivo to track pre-integrative latency. DUSQ can be adapted to the detection of other rare DNA molecules.},

 abstract = {Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is a devastating plant pathogenic fungi known for wilt disease in the tomato plant and secrete cell wall degrading enzymes. These enzymes are collectively known as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), crucial for growth, colonization and pathogenesis. Therefore, the present study was aimed to identify and annotate pathogen CAZymes in the xylem sap of a susceptible tomato variety using downstream proteomics and meta servers. Further, structural elucidation and conformational stability analysis of the selected CAZyme families were done through homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation. Among all the fungal proteins identified, the carbohydrate metabolic process was found to be enriched. Most of the annotated CAZymes belonged to the hydrolase and oxidoreductase families, and 90\% were soluble and extracellular. Moreover, using a publically available interactome database, interactions were observed between the families acting on chitin, hemicellulose and pectin. Subsequently, important catalytic residues were identified in the candidate CAZymes belonging to carbohydrate esterase (CE8) and glycosyl hydrolase (GH18 and GH28). Further, essential dynamics after molecular simulation of 100 ns revealed the overall behavior of these CAZymes with distinct global minima and transition states in CE8. Thus, our study identified some of the CAZyme families that assist in pathogenesis and growth through host cell wall deconstruction with further structural insight into the selected CAZyme families.

 abstract = {Thirteen new freshwater populations of the copepod genus BoeckellaDe Guerne \&amp; Richard, 1889 were found during three expeditions to New Caledonia (‘La Planète Revisitée,’ 2016-2018). The 12 populations from the Plaine des Lacs, which show remarkable genetic diversity among themselves, were identified as B. spinogibbaDefaye, 1998, the only species of its genus known from New Caledonia until now. The sole exception, the population from Mont-Dore 22 km further east, appeared genetically and morphologically distinct from the others and is described herein as a new species. The two species are distinguished from each other by the shapes of the male and female P5, female Th5, and body colour. A previously published key is amended to separate the species. Our concatenated COI+28S phylogeny places the two New Caledonia species as a new branch within Boeckella, distinct from the branches consisting of South American, Antarctic and Australasian species. All 13 Boeckella populations inhabit the extreme south of New Caledonia, an area known for endemism and high heavy metal concentrations in the soil. Extensive mining activity in this metal-rich area, begun in 1873, is now leading to conflict with conservation goals. By using aerial photographs to trace the fate of the pond that is the type locality of B. spinogibba, we confirmed that it disappeared between 2007 and 2014 as a result of the expansion of the Goro nickel mine.},

Yet, for many ubiquitous microbes, there is limited knowledge regarding the identity and function of secreted proteins. Here, we introduce EXCRETE (enhanced exoproteome characterization by mass spectrometry), a workflow that enables comprehensive description of microbial exoproteomes from minimal starting material. Using cyanobacteria as a case study, we benchmark EXCRETE and show a significant increase over current methods in the identification of extracellular proteins. Subsequently, we show that EXCRETE can be miniaturized and adapted to a 96-well high-throughput format. Application of EXCRETE to cyanobacteria from different habitats (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901, and Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102), and in different cultivation conditions, identified up to 85\% of all potentially secreted proteins. Finally, functional analysis reveals that cell envelope maintenance and nutrient acquisition are central functions of the predicted cyanobacterial secretome. Collectively, these findings challenge the general belief that cyanobacteria lack secretory proteins and suggest that multiple functions of the secretome are conserved across freshwater, marine, and terrestrial species.},

@article{sabala_carbapenem_2024,
 abstract = {Background
Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a great public health problem and is associated with many disease outbreaks and high mortality rates. Alarmingly, K. pneumoniae has been isolated from food in several recent studies. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of CRKP in food samples from Egypt.
Methods
A total of 311 food samples (including 116 minced meat, 92 chicken meat, 75 diced meat, and 28 mutton) were collected from local markets in Egypt and were screened for CRKP with the determination of their antimicrobial resistance profiles. The whole genome sequence was done for 23 CRKP isolates to clarify the relationship between CRKP from food and human cases in Egypt using the SNP core genome. The conjugation probability of the blaNDM-5 harboring plasmid was identified using oriTfinder
Results
CRKP was isolated from 11\% (35/311) of the samples, with 45.71\% (16/35) of them showing resistance to colistin, one of the last-resort options for treating CRKP-mediated infections. In addition to the carbapenem and colistin resistance, the CRKP isolates frequently exhibited resistance to multiple antimicrobials including β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol. In addition, most of the CRKP were potentially hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (HvKP) identified as phylogroup Kp1 and of high-risk groups as detected in STs reported in many human outbreaks globally, such as ST383 and ST147. The core-genome phylogeny showed similarities between the isolates from this study and those previously isolated from clinical human samples in Egypt. In addition, analysis of the plasmid on which blaNDM is encoded revealed that several antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaOXA-9, blaCTX-M-15, aac(6′)-Ib, qnrS1, and several virulence genes are encoded on the same plasmid.
Conclusions
This study is significant for food safety and public health and is important to further identify the change in the epidemiology of CRKP infections, especially the consumption of contaminated food products.},

 abstract = {Introduction: MicroRNAs have a significant role in the regulation of the transcriptome. Several miRNAs have been proposed as potential biomarkers in different malignancies. However, contradictory results have been reported on the capability of miRNA biomarkers in cancer detection. The human biological clock involves molecular mechanisms that regulate several genes over time. Therefore, the sampling time becomes one of the significant factors in gene expression studies.Method: In the present study, we have tried to find miRNAs with minimum fluctuation in expression levels at different time points that could be more accurate candidates as diagnostic biomarkers. The small RNA-seq raw data of ten healthy individuals across nine-time points were analyzed to identify miRNAs with stable expression.Results: We have found five oscillation patterns. The stable miRNAs were investigated in 779 small-RNA-seq datasets of eleven cancer types. All miRNAs with the highest differential expression were selected for further analysis. The selected miRNAs were explored for functional pathways. The predominantly enriched pathways were miRNA in cancer and the P53-signaling pathway. Finally, we have found seven miRNAs, including miR-142-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-223-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-148b-3p, miR-340-5p, and miR-421. These miRNAs showed minimum fluctuation in healthy blood and were dysregulated in the blood of eleven cancer types. Conclusion: We have found a signature of seven stable miRNAs which dysregulate in several cancer types and may serve as potential pan-cancer biomarkers.},

@phdthesis{sabrina_statistical_2020,
 abstract = {Protein-RNA interactions play an important role in all post-transcriptional regulatory processes. High throughput detection of protein-RNA interactions has been facilitated by the emerging CLIP-seq (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing) techniques. Enrichments in mapped reads as well as base transitions or deletions at crosslink sites can be used to infer binding regions. Single-nucleotide resolution techniques (iCLIP and eCLIP) have been achieved by capturing high fractions of cDNAs which are truncated at protein-RNA crosslink sites. Increasing numbers of datasets and derivatives of these protocols have been published in recent years, requiring tailored computational analyses. Existing methods unfortunately do not explicitly model the specifics of truncation patterns and possible biases caused by background binding or crosslinking sequence preferences. 
We present PureCLIP, a hidden Markov model based approach, which simultaneously performs peak calling and individual crosslink site detection. It is capable of incorporating external data to correct for non-specific background signals and, for the first time, for the crosslinking biases. We devised a comprehensive evaluation based on three strategies. Firstly, we developed a workflow to simulate iCLIP data, which starts from real RNA-seq data and known binding regions and then mimics the experimental steps of the iCLIP protocol, including the generation of background signals. Secondly, we used experimental iCLIP and eCLIP datasets, using the proteins’ known predominant binding regions. And thirdly, we assessed the agreement of called sites between replicates, assuming target-specific signals are reproducible between replicates. 
On both simulated and real data, PureCLIP is consistently more precise in calling crosslink sites than other state-of-the-art methods. In particular when incorporating input control data and crosslink associated motifs (CL-motifs) PureCLIP is up to 13\% more precise than other methods and we show that it has an up to 20\% higher agreement across replicates. Moreover, our method can optionally merge called crosslink sites to binding regions based on their distance and we show that the resulting regions reflect the known binding regions with high-resolution. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method achieves a high precision robustly over a range of different settings and performs well for proteins with different binding characteristics. Lastly, we extended the method to include individual CLIP replicates and show that this can boost the precision even further. PureCLIP and its documenta- tion are publicly available at https://github.com/skrakau/PureCLIP.},

An IncC plasmid carrying the blaNDM-1 gene also carried the rare rmtC gene, encoding for 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16RMTases), conferring resistance to all aminoglycosides. The global spread of New Delhi metallo (NDM) variants and their association with the 16RMTases among K. pneumoniae complete genomes available in GenBank was studied, and a complete overview of the association of 16RMTases and NDM in K. pneumoniae genomics was produced. NDM is often associated with16RMTases, and both are spreading in K. pneumoniae, conferring resistance to all beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. This analysis suggests that aminoglycosides have a limited future as a second-line treatment against NDM-producing K. pneumoniae.},

Early detection of ER+ and TNBC is crucial in the choice of diagnosis and appropriate treatment strategy. Here we report the key genes associated to ER+ and TNBC using RNA-Seq analysis and machine learning models. Three ER+ and TNBC RNA seq datasets comprising 164 patients in-toto were selected for standard NGS hierarchical data processing and data analyses protocols. Enrichment pathway analysis and network analysis was done and finally top hub genes were identified. To come with a reliable classifier which could distinguish the distinct transcriptome patterns associated to ER+ and TNBC, ML models were built employing Naïve Bayes, SVM and kNN. 1730 common DEG’s exhibiting significant logFC values with 0.05 p-value threshold were identified. A list of top ten hub genes were screened on the basis of maximal clique centrality (MCC) which included CDC20, CDK1, BUB1, AURKA, CDCA8, RRM2, TTK, CENPF, CEP55 and NDC80.These genes were found to be involved in crucial cell cycle pathways. k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) model was observed to be best classifier with accuracy 84\%, specificity 66\% and sensitivity 95\% to differentiate between ER+ and TNBC RNA-Seq transcriptomes. Our screened list of 10 hub genes can thus help unearth novel molecular signatures implicated in ER+ and TNBC onset, prognosis and design of novel protocols for breast cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.},

 abstract = {Shoot growth directly impacts plant productivity. Plants adjust their shoot growth in response to varying environments to maximize resource capture and stress resilience. While several factors controlling shoot growth are known, the complexity of the regulation and the input of the environment are not fully understood. We have investigated shoot growth repression induced by low ambient temperatures in hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana Kro-0 and BG-5 accessions. To continue our previous studies, we confirmed that the Kro-0 allele of DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 3B causes stunted shoot growth in the BG-5 background. We also found that shoot growth repression was most pronounced near the apex at a lower temperature and that the cells in the hybrid stem failed to elongate correctly. Furthermore, we observed that shoot growth repression in hybrids depended on light availability. Global gene expression analysis indicated the involvement of hormones, especially strigolactone, associated with the dwarf phenotype. Altogether, this study enhances our knowledge on the genetic, physiological and environmental factors associated with shoot growth regulation.},

@article{sajulga_survey_2020,
 abstract = {To gain a thorough appreciation of microbiome dynamics, researchers characterize the functional relevance of expressed microbial genes or proteins. This can be accomplished through metaproteomics, which characterizes the protein expression of microbiomes. Several software tools exist for analyzing microbiomes at the functional level by measuring their combined proteome-level response to environmental perturbations. In this survey, we explore the performance of six available tools, to enable researchers to make informed decisions regarding software choice based on their research goals. Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from dental caries plaque samples grown with and without sucrose in paired biofilm reactors were used as representative data for this evaluation. Microbial peptides from one sample pair were identified by the X! tandem search algorithm via SearchGUI and subjected to functional analysis using software tools including eggNOG-mapper, MEGAN5, MetaGOmics, MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA), ProPHAnE, and Unipept to generate functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Among these software tools, notable differences in functional annotation were detected after comparing differentially expressed protein functional groups. Based on the generated GO terms of these tools we performed a peptide-level comparison to evaluate the quality of their functional annotations. A BLAST analysis against the NCBI non-redundant database revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of functional annotation varied between tools. For example, eggNOG-mapper mapped to the most number of GO terms, while Unipept generated more accurate GO terms. Based on our evaluation, metaproteomics researchers can choose the software according to their analytical needs and developers can use the resulting feedback to further optimize their algorithms. To make more of these tools accessible via scalable metaproteomics workflows, eggNOG-mapper and Unipept 4.0 were incorporated into the Galaxy platform.},

positive for DCH. One of the two positive cases had elevated liver enzymes of unknown
etiology, and the other had hepatocellular adenoma. Our study indicated that DCH infection
was observed in domestic cats in the Tokyo area of Japan as well as other reported areas
in the world. Further investigations are needed to define the clinical importance of
DCH.},

 abstract = {Neurodegeneration is the primary driver of disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) resulting in permanent disability, creating an urgent need to discover its underlying mechanisms. Herein, we establish that dysfunction of the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) results in differential of binding to RNA targets causing alternative RNA splicing, which contributes to neurodegeneration in MS and its models. Using RNAseq of MS brains, we discovered differential expression and aberrant splicing of hnRNP A1 target RNAs involved in neuronal function and RNA homeostasis. We confirmed this in vivo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis employing CLIPseq specific for hnRNP A1, where hnRNP A1 differentially binds and regulates RNA, including aberrantly spliced targets identified in human samples. Additionally, dysfunctional hnRNP A1 expression in neurons caused neurite loss and identical changes in splicing, corroborating hnRNP A1 dysfunction as a cause of neurodegeneration. Collectively, these data indicate hnRNP A1 dysfunction causes altered neuronal RNA splicing, resulting in neurodegeneration in MS.},

@article{sanchez-leon_heteroresistance_2023,
 abstract = {Heteroresistance to colistin can be defined as the presence of resistant subpopulations in an isolate that is susceptible to this antibiotic. Colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is more frequently related to chromosomal mutations and insertions. This work aimed to study heteroresistance in nine clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing OXA-48 and to describe genomic changes in mutants with acquired resistance in vitro. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution (BMD) and heteroresistance by population analysis profiling (PAP). The proteins related to colistin resistance were analyzed for the presence of mutations. Additionally, PCR of the mgrB gene was performed to identify the presence of insertions. In the nine parental isolates, the PAP method showed colistin heteroresistance of colonies growing on plates with concentrations of up to 64 mg/L, corresponding to stable mutant subpopulations. The MICs of some mutants from the PAP plate containing 4×MIC of colistin had absolute values of ≤2 mg/L that were higher than the parental MICs and were defined as persistent variants. PCR of the mgrB gene identified an insertion sequence that inactivated the gene in 21 mutants. Other substitutions in the investigated mutants were found in PhoP, PhoQ, PmrB, PmrC, CrrA and CrrB proteins. Colistin heteroresistance in K. pneumoniae isolates was attributed mainly to insertions in the mgrB gene and point mutations in colistin resistance proteins. The results of this study will improve understanding regarding the mechanisms of colistin resistance in mutants of K. pneumoniae producing OXA-48.},

En este trabajo se evalúa la HR a colistina en diversas cepas de Klebsiella pneumoniae con fenotipo silvestre (Kp-WT) y productoras de la carbapenemasa OXA-48 (Kp-OXA48). Para ello, la sensibilidad a colistina se determinó mediante microdilución en caldo (BMD) y la HR mediante análisis de perfil de población (PAP). Los mutantes resistentes se caracterizaron a nivel molecular mediante el análisis del genoma completo y PCR del gen mgrB para identificar la presencia de mutaciones en genes relacionados con la síntesis del lipopolisacárido. La BMD determino que todas las cepas estudiadas fueron sensibles a colistina y el método PAP mostro que las CMIs de algunos mutantes de la placa PAP que contenía 4×MIC de colistina tenían valores absolutos similares a las CMIs parentales y se definieron como variantes persistentes mientras que la HR a colistina de las colonias que crecían en placas con concentraciones de hasta 32-64 mg/L, correspondieron a subpoblaciones mutantes estables. La PCR del gen mgrB identifico diversas secuencias de inserción que inactivaba el gen en 14 mutantes de Kp-WT y en 21 mutantes de Kp-OXA48 pertenecientes principalmente a la familia IS1 (ISKpn14) and IS5 (ISKpn74). En los mutantes de Kp- WT se identificaron mutaciones puntuales en proteínas relacionadas con la síntesis del lipopolisacárido (MgrB, PhoP, PhoQ, PmrB, CrrA y CrrB). En los mutantes de Kp- OXA48 se identificaron también mutaciones puntuales en estas proteínas; la HR a colistina en estos aislados se atribuyó fundamentalmente a las inserciones y mutaciones puntuales detectadas. Los resultados de este estudio podrían mejorar la comprensión de los mecanismos de resistencia a colistina en mutantes de Kp-WT y Kp-OXA48.},

 abstract = {Bacterial key species (BKS) is unique and found only in peat secondary forest, but not in converted peat areas. Its presence helps in biomonitoring of peatland quality. BKS candidates were detected based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence using the Next Generation Sequencing method. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing data were obtained from DNA isolated from peat soil of the secondary forest (SF), acacia plantations (AP), and rubber plantations (RP) in the Giam Siak Kecil - Bukit Batu (GSK-BB) Biosphere Reserve, Riau. The natural vegetation of peat swamp forest dominates the SF, which was relatively heterogeneous with anaerobic conditions and water level at 60-120 cm. The RP locations were planted with 6-7 year old rubber, water level was 20 cm, and the garden was not maintained. The AP locations were planted with A. crassicarpa and peat thickness was 9 m. The peat soil was sampled in August 2019. BKS candidates were selected based on a phylogenetic tree using MEGA 6.06 by observing the grouping of DNA sequences obtained only from secondary forests. Furthermore, the selection was also conducted using BLASTn: Align Two or More Sequence analysis to determine the similarity between selected BKS candidates. Based on the detected BKS candidate, a specific primer was designed to amplify the BKS sequence, and the specificity was tested in silico with FastPCR to detect that the primer was only for the amplification of the BKS target. Two BKS candidates with the same sequence length of 455 bp were discovered in the secondary forests and there were successfully amplified by 2 pairs of specific primers. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two BKS candidates could be used to monitor the peat quality that has been converted into plantation areas molecularly.},

JunB is required for expression of genes controlled by BATF and IRF4 in CD4+ T cell responses, but the role of JunB in CD8+ T cells remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that JunB is essential for cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. JunB expression is transiently induced, depending on T cell receptor (TCR) signal strength. JunB deficiency severely impairs clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells in response to acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Junb-deficient CD8+ T cells fail to control transcription and chromatin accessibility of a specific set of genes regulated by BATF and IRF4, resulting in impaired cell survival, glycolysis, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell differentiation. Furthermore, JunB deficiency enhances expression of coinhibitory receptors, including programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM3) upon activation of naïve CD8+ T cells. These results indicate that JunB, in collaboration with BATF and IRF4, promotes multiple key events in the early stage of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses.},

In the context of epithelial ovarian cancer, a highly heterogeneous disease with diverse subtypes, it is paramount to study a wide panel of models in order to draw a representative picture of the disease. As this lethal gynaecological malignancy has seen little improvement in overall survival in the last decade, it is all the more pressing to support future research with robust and diverse study models. Here, we describe ten novel spontaneously immortalized patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines, detailing their respective mutational profiles and gene/biomarker expression patterns, as well as their in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics. Eight of the cell lines were classified as high-grade serous, while two were determined to be of the rarer mucinous and clear cell subtypes, respectively. Each of the ten cell lines presents a panel of characteristics reflective of diverse clinically relevant phenomena, including chemotherapeutic resistance, metastatic potential, and subtype-associated mutations and gene/protein expression profiles. Importantly, four cell lines formed subcutaneous tumors in mice, a key characteristic for pre-clinical drug testing. Our work thus contributes significantly to the available models for the study of ovarian cancer, supplying additional tools to better understand this complex disease.},

 abstract = {RNA-RNA intra- and intermolecular interactions are fundamental for numerous biological processes. While there are reasonable approaches to map RNA secondary structures genome-wide, understanding how different RNAs interact to carry out their regulatory functions requires mapping of intermolecular base pairs. RNA-RNA interaction prediction algorithms alone are not capable to consider all biological factors, thus, they suffer from low accuracy. Recently, different strategies to detect RNA-RNA duplexes in living cells, so called direct duplex detection (DDD) methods, have been developed. Common to all is the psoralen-mediated in vivo RNA crosslinking followed by RNA Proximity Ligation to join the two interacting RNA strands. Sequencing of the RNA via classical RNA-Seq and subsequent specialised bioinformatic analyses, which results in the prediction of intra- and intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. Existing approaches adapt standard RNA-seq analysis pipelines but often neglect inherent features of RNA-RNA interactions that are useful for filtering and statistical assessment. In this work, RNAnue is presented, a general pipeline for the inference of RNA-RNA interactions from DDD experiments that takes into account hybridisation potential and statistical significance to improve prediction accuracy. RNAnue was applied to data from different DDD studies, and the results were compared to those of the original methods. This showed that RNAnue performs better in terms of prediction quantity and quality.},

@article{schafer_practical_2024,
 abstract = {Generating complete, high-quality genome assemblies is key for any downstream analysis, such as comparative genomics. For bacterial genome assembly, various algorithms and fully automated pipelines exist, which are free-of-charge and easily accessible. However, these assembly tools often cannot unambiguously resolve a bacterial genome, for example due to the presence of sequence repeat structures on the chromosome or on plasmids. Then, a more sophisticated approach and/or manual curation is needed. Such modifications can be challenging, especially for non-bioinformaticians, because they are generally not considered as a straightforward process. In this study, we propose a standardized approach for manual genome completion focusing on the popular hybrid assembly pipeline Unicycler. The provided Galaxy workflow addresses two weaknesses in Unicycler’s hybrid assemblies: (i) collapse of inter-plasmidic repeats and (ii) false loss of single-copy sequences. To demonstrate and validate how to detect and resolve these assembly errors, we use two genomes from the Bacillus cereus group. By applying the proposed pipeline following an automated assembly, the genome sequence quality can be significantly improved.},

@article{schildhauer_glycation_2023,
 abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor that often utilizes aerobic glycolysis for energy production (Warburg effect), resulting in increased methylglyoxal (MGO) production. MGO, a reactive dicarbonyl compound, causes protein alterations and cellular dysfunction via glycation. In this study, we investigated the effect of glycation on sialylation, a common post-translational modification implicated in cancer. Our experiments using glioma cell lines, human astrocytes (hA), and primary glioma samples revealed different gene expressions of sialyltransferases among cells, highlighting the complexity of the system. Glycation has a differential effect on sialyltransferase expression, upregulating ST8SIA4 in the LN229 and U251 cell lines and decreasing the expression in normal hA. Subsequently, polysialylation increased in the LN229 and U251 cell lines and decreased in hA. This increase in polysialylation could lead to a more aggressive phenotype due to its involvement in cancer hallmark processes such as immune evasion, resistance to apoptosis, and enhancing invasion. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying GBM aggressiveness and suggest that targeting glycation and sialylation could be a potential therapeutic strategy.},

Therefore, this study used CNV and control specimens which had been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded immediately after surgical extraction and analyzed them using a 3’ RNA sequencing approach. Transcriptome profiles were analyzed and used to estimate content of immune and stromal cells and to define disease-associated gene signatures using statistical and bioinformatic methods. We identified 158 differentially-expressed genes (DEG) that were significantly increased in CNV compared to control tissue. Cell type enrichment analysis revealed a diverse cellular landscape with an enrichment of immune and stroma cell types in CNV including endothelial cells, macrophages, T cells and NKT cells. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that DEG contributed to Blood Vessel Development, Extracellular Structure Organization, Response to Wounding and several immune-related terms. The S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) and S100A9 emerged among the top DEG, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry on CNV tissue and protein analysis of vitreous samples. This study provides a high-resolution RNA-sequencing-based transcriptional signature of human CNV, characterizes its compositional pattern of immune and stromal cells and reveals S100A8/A9 as a novel biomarker and promising target for AMD-directed therapeutics and diagnostics.},

 abstract = {Bioimage data are generated in diverse research fields throughout the life and biomedical sciences. Its potential for advancing scientific progress via modern, data-driven discovery approaches reaches beyond disciplinary borders. To fully exploit this potential, it is necessary to make bioimaging data, in general, multidimensional microscopy images and image series, FAIR, that is, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. These FAIR principles for research data management are now widely accepted in the scientific community and have been adopted by funding agencies, policymakers and publishers. To remain competitive and at the forefront of research, implementing the FAIR principles into daily routines is an essential but challenging task for researchers and research infrastructures. Imaging core facilities, well-established providers of access to imaging equipment and expertise, are in an excellent position to lead this transformation in bioimaging research data management. They are positioned at the intersection of research groups, IT infrastructure providers, the institution´s administration, and microscope vendors. In the frame of German BioImaging – Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis (GerBI-GMB), cross-institutional working groups and third-party funded projects were initiated in recent years to advance the bioimaging community's capability and capacity for FAIR bioimage data management. Here, we provide an imaging-core-facility-centric perspective outlining the experience and current strategies in Germany to facilitate the practical adoption of the FAIR principles closely aligned with the international bioimaging community. We highlight which tools and services are ready to be implemented and what the future directions for FAIR bioimage data have to offer.},

Rearrangements of the KMT2A gene drive epigenetic changes that lead to aberrant gene expression profiles that strongly favor leukemia development. Apart from this genetic lesion, the mutational landscape of KMT2A-rearranged ALL is remarkably silent, providing limited insights for the development of targeted therapy. Consequently, identifying potential therapeutic targets often relies on differential gene expression, yet the inhibition of these genes has rarely translated into successful therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out screens to search for genetic dependencies in KMT2A-rearranged ALL. We utilized small-guide RNA libraries directed against the entire human epigenome and kinome in various KMT2A-rearranged ALL, as well as wild-type KMT2A ALL cell line models. This screening approach led to the discovery of the epigenetic regulators ARID4B and MBD3, as well as the receptor kinase BMPR2 as novel molecular vulnerabilities and attractive therapeutic targets in KMT2A-rearranged ALL.},

To gain insights into tumorigenesis and molecular profiles of these tumors, and to ultimately suggest alternative treatment options, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model by breeding hGFAP-cre::Trp53Fl/Fl::lsl-MYCN mice. All mice developed aggressive forebrain tumors early in their lifetime that mimic human HGG-MYCN regarding histology, DNA methylation, and gene expression. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a high intratumoral heterogeneity with neuronal and oligodendroglial lineage signatures. High-throughput drug screening using both mouse and human tumor cells finally indicated high efficacy of Doxorubicin, Irinotecan, and Etoposide as possible therapy options that children with HGG-MYCN might benefit from.},

Because of their critical roles, G4s are potential antiviral targets, yet their function remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize the formation and functions of a conserved G4 within the polymerase coding region of orthoflaviviruses of the Flaviviridae family. Using yellow fever virus, we determine that this G4 promotes viral replication and suppresses host stress responses via interactions with hnRNPH1, a host nuclear protein involved in RNA processing. G4 binding to hnRNPH1 causes its cytoplasmic retention with subsequent impacts on G4-containing tRNA fragments (tiRNAs) involved in stress-mediated reductions in translation. As a result, these host stress responses and associated antiviral effects are impaired. These data reveal that the interplay between hnRNPH1 and both host and viral G4 targets controls the integrated stress response and viral replication.},

@phdthesis{schulze_identification_2023,
 abstract = {The ”virosphere” refers to the entire realm of viruses that exist on Earth. It includes all types of viruses, but up until recently, research has been mainly focused on those that directly affect humans and other animal or plant species of economic relevance.Yet, the virosphere is estimated to be incredibly vast, with millions of different viral species, and it is believed that many more viruses are yet to be discovered. The study of the virosphere is crucial for understanding the diversity, evolution, and ecology of viruses and their interactions with their hosts. It is also important for identifying potential threats to human and animal health, such as emerging infectious diseases, and for developing strategies to prevent and control viral infections. One part of the virosphere are arboviruses, or arthropod-borne viruses, a group of viruses that are transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and sandflies. Arboviral diseases, including dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika fever, West Nile fever, and yellow fever, have a significant impact on global public health. The emergence and re-emergence of arboviral diseases have become a major concern worldwide due to their increasing incidence and geographic spread. While discovery and description of arboviruses primarily emanated from ’classical’ virological research, the discovery of new virus species, and even whole families, is now often due to the proliferation of advanced sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools. Another part of the virosphere, that is of some relevance to arboviruses, are insect- or mosquito-specific viruses. These are a group of viruses that have co-evolved with their insect hosts, particularly mosquitoes, and do not infect vertebrates. These viruses have recently received increasing attention due to their potential as a tool for controlling mosquito-borne diseases. Research on insect- or mosquitospecific viruses is essential to understand their biology, evolution, and ecology as well as characterizing their potential to reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. The presented study is a combined approach, using both sequencing and bioinformatical analysis as well as ’classical’ virological and molecular techniques, to investigate the relationships of mosquito-specific viruses, arboviruses and the mosquito immune-system. Next-generation sequencing techniques were used to identify viral species from field samples. Small RNA sequencing was used to further analyse the interactions of the discovered viruses with the mosquito antiviral RNA interference machinery. Further, experiments were performed to analyse the influence of key effector proteins, Dicer and Argonaute, on the replication of these viruses. Finally, experiments on the interactions of mosquito-specific viruses with arboviruses, focused on viral replication and regulation of the host RNA interference system, were performed. In conclusion, the aggregated data expands our knowledge on the complex virus-virus-host interactions and supplements further approaches in studying mosquito-specific viruses as tools for arbovirus transmission control.},

When we mimicked an early systemic viral infection or applied murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) systemically in neonatal female and male mice, only male adolescent mice presented behavioral deficits, including reduced social behavior and cognition. This was paralleled by an increased amount of infiltrating T cells in the brain parenchyma, enhanced interferon-γ (IFNγ) signaling, and epigenetic reprogramming of microglial cells. These microglial cells showed increased phagocytic activity, which resulted in abnormal loss of excitatory synapses within the hippocampal brain region. None of these alterations were seen in female adolescent mice. Our findings underscore the early postnatal period’s susceptibility to cause sex-dependent long-term CNS deficiencies following infections.},

Several members such as PRDM1, PRDM14 and PRDM9, have been implicated in germ cell specification and homoeostasis and are essential to fertility-related processes. Others, such as PRDM14, PRDM15 and PRDM10 play a role in early embryogenesis and embryonic stem cell maintenance. Here, we describe the first PRDM family member with a maternal effect. Absence of maternal Prdm10 results in catastrophic failure of oocyte-to-embryo transition and complete arrest at the 2-cell stage. We describe multiple defects in oocytes, zygotes and 2-cell stage embryos relating to the failure to accumulate PRDM10 target gene transcripts in the egg. Transcriptomic analysis and integration of genome-wide chromatin-binding data reveals new and essential PRDM10 targets, including the cytoskeletal protein encoding gene Septin11. We demonstrate that the failure to express maternal Septin11, in the absence of maternal PRDM10, disrupts Septin-complex assembly at the polar body extrusion site in MII oocytes. Our study sheds light into the essentiality of maternal PRDM10, the requirement of the maternal Septin-complex and the likely evolutionary conservation of this regulatory axis in human female germ cells.},

Although the interactions of some plant hormones (abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, and ethylene) with the glutathione s-transferase (GST) enzyme, which is one of the antioxidant enzymes, have already been reported, the influence of gibberellic acid (GA3) on this enzyme under saline conditions has not yet been reported. Plant material for the experiments was obtained from M14G144 cultivar of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown as a soil culture in growth chambers at 22 °C, 65–70\% moisture, 16-h light/8-h dark conditions, and with full strength Hoagland solution for 8 days under controlled growth conditions. Then, the plants were exposed to salt stress (350 mM NaCl and 100, 300, and 500 ppm GA3) simultaneously. In maize leaves, GA3 treatment alleviated the physiological parameters under salt stress. Specifically, the treatments with 100 and 500 ppm of GA3 were able to trigger GST enzyme and isoenzyme activities as well as hydrogen sulfide accumulation and anthocyanin content, although the lowest malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide radical content were under the treatment of 300 ppm of GA3. Besides this, GST gene expression levels were found to be upregulated between 1.5 and fourfold higher in all the plants treated with GA3 at different concentrations in proportion to salt stress. These results first indicated that the reason for the changes in GA3-treated plants was the stimulating role of this hormone to maintain GST regulation in maize plants.},

The inefficacy of traditional antibiotic drugs could be surmounted through the exploitation of natural bioactive compounds of which medicinal plants are a great reservoir. The finding that bacteria living inside plant tissues, (i.e., the endophytic bacterial microbiome) can influence the synthesis of the aforementioned compounds leads to the necessity of unraveling the mechanisms involved in the determination of this symbiotic relationship. Here, we report the genome sequence of four endophytic bacterial strains isolated from the medicinal plant Origanum vulgare L. and able to antagonize the growth of opportunistic pathogens of cystic fibrosis patients. The in silico analysis revealed the presence of gene clusters involved in the production of antimicrobial compounds, such as paeninodin, paenilarvins, polymyxin, and paenicidin A. Endophytes’ adaptation to the plant microenvironment was evaluated through the analysis of the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the four genomes. The diesel fuel degrading potential was also tested. Strains grew in minimum media supplemented with diesel fuel, but no n-alkanes degradation genes were found in their genomes, suggesting that diesel fuel degradation might occur through other steps involving enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of aromatic compounds.},

However, members of their microbiota can also synthesize bioactive molecules. Among these, strains belonging to the genera Arthrobacter are commonly found associated with the plant’s microenvironments, showing plant growth-promoting (PGP) activity and bioremediation properties. However, their role as antimicrobial secondary metabolite producers has not been fully explored. The aim of this work was to characterize the Arthrobacter sp. OVS8 endophytic strain, isolated from the medicinal plant Origanum vulgare L., from molecular and phenotypic viewpoints to evaluate its adaptation and influence on the plant internal microenvironments and its potential as a producer of antibacterial volatile molecules (VOCs). Results obtained from the phenotypic and genomic characterization highlight its ability to produce volatile antimicrobials effective against multidrug-resistant (MDR) human pathogens and its putative PGP role as a producer of siderophores and degrader of organic and inorganic pollutants. The outcomes presented in this work identify Arthrobacter sp. OVS8 as an excellent starting point toward the exploitation of bacterial endophytes as antibiotics sources.},

@article{shaikh_stcdf1_2024,
 abstract = {Transcription factors of the CYCLING DOF FACTOR (CDF) family activate in potato the SP6A FT tuberization signal in leaves. In modern cultivars, truncated StCDF1.2 alleles override strict SD control by stabilizing the StCDF1 protein, which leads to StCOL1 suppression and impaired activation of the antagonic SP5G paralog. By using DAP-seq and RNA-seq studies, we here show that StCDF1 not only acts as an upstream regulator of the day length pathway but also directly regulates several N assimilation and transport genes. StCDF1 directly represses expression of NITRATE REDUCTASE (NR/NIA), which catalyses the first reduction step in nitrate assimilation, and is encoded by a single potato locus. StCDF1 knock-down lines performed better in N-limiting conditions, and this phenotype correlated with derepressed StNR expression. Also, deletion of the StNR DAP-seq region abolished repression by StCDF1, while it did not affect NLP7-dependent activation of the StNR promoter. We identified multiple nucleotide polymorphisms in the DAP-seq region in potato cultivars with early StCDF1 alleles, suggesting that this genetic variation was selected as compensatory mechanism to the negative impact of StCDF1 stabilization. Thereby, directed modification of the StCDF1-recognition elements emerges as a promising strategy to enhance limiting StNR activity in potato.},

 abstract = {Tea, a widely consumed aromatic beverage, is often adulterated with dyes such as Bismarck brown Y (C.I. 21000) (BBY), Prussian blue, and Plumbago, which pose potential health risks. The objective of this study is to analyze how the food dye BBY interacts with serum protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). This study investigated the BBY-BSA interaction at the molecular level. Fluorescence spectroscopy results showed that the quenching of BSA by BBY is carried out by dynamic quenching mechanism. The displacement assay and molecular docking studies revealed that BBY binds at the flavanone binding site of BSA with hydrophobic interactions. Circular Dichroism results indicate the structural stability of the protein upon BBY binding. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of the complex in a dynamic solvent system, and quantum mechanics calculations showed slight conformational changes of the diaminophenyl ring due to increased hydrophobic interaction. The energetics of gas phase optimized and stable MD structures of BBY indicated similar values which further confirmed that the conformational changes were minor, and it also exhibited a moderate binding with BSA as shown by the MM/PBSA results. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular-level interactions between BBY and BSA, emphasizing the critical role of hydrophobic interactions.},

 abstract = {The oomycete Pythium oligandrum is a potential biocontrol agent to control a wide range of fungal and oomycete-caused diseases, such as Pythium myriotylum-caused rhizome rot in ginger, leading to reduced yields and compromised quality. Previously, P. oligandrum has been studied for its plant growth-promoting potential by auxin production and induction of disease resistance by elicitors such as oligandrin. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play beneficial roles in sustainable agriculture by enhancing plant growth and resistance. We investigated the contribution of P. oligandrum-produced VOCs on plant growth and disease suppression by initially using Nicotiana benthamiana plants for screening. P. oligandrum VOCs significantly enhanced tobacco seedling and plant biomass contents. Screening of the individual VOCs showed that 3-octanone and hexadecane promoted the growth of tobacco seedlings. The total VOCs from P. oligandrum also enhanced the shoot and root growth of ginger plants. Transcriptomic analysis showed a higher expression of genes related to plant growth hormones and stress responses in the leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. The concentrations of plant growth hormones such as auxin, zeatin, and gibberellic acid were higher in the leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. In a ginger disease biocontrol assay, the VOC-exposed ginger plants infected with P. myriotylum had lower levels of disease severity. We conclude that this study contributes to understanding the growth-promoting mechanisms of P. oligandrum on ginger and tobacco, priming of ginger plants against various stresses, and the mechanisms of action of P. oligandrum as a biocontrol agent.
IMPORTANCE Plant growth promotion plays a vital role in enhancing production of agricultural crops, and Pythium oligandrum is known for its plant growth-promoting potential through production of auxins and induction of resistance by elicitors. This study highlights the significance of P. oligandrum-produced VOCs in plant growth promotion and disease resistance. Transcriptomic analyses of leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs revealed the upregulation of genes involved in plant growth hormone signaling and stress responses. Moreover, the concentration of growth hormones significantly increased in P. oligandrum VOC-exposed ginger plants. Additionally, the disease severity was reduced in P. myriotylum-infected ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. In ginger, P. myriotylum-caused rhizome rot disease results in severe losses, and biocontrol has a role as part of an integrated pest management strategy for rhizome rot disease. Overall, growth enhancement and disease reduction in plants exposed to P. oligandrum-produced VOCs contribute to its role as a biocontrol agent.},

 abstract = {Background
Ischemia of the bile duct is a common feature in liver disease and transplantation, which represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially after liver transplantation. Detailed knowledge of its pathogenesis remains incomplete due to the lack of appropriate in vitro models.
Methods
To recapitulate biliary damage induced by ischemia and reperfusion in vitro, human intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ICOs) were grown at low oxygen levels of 1\% up to 72 h, followed by re-oxygenation at normal levels.
Findings
ICOs stressed by ischemia and subsequent re-oxygenation represented the dynamic change in biliary cell proliferation, upregulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated markers, and the evocation of phase-dependent cell death programs similar to what is described in patients. Clinical-grade alpha-1 antitrypsin was identified as a potent inhibitor of both ischemia-induced apoptosis and necroptosis.
Interpretation
These findings demonstrate that ICOs recapitulate ischemic cholangiopathy in vitro and enable drug assessment studies for the discovery of new therapeutics for ischemic cholangiopathies.

 abstract = {Fusarium wilt of banana, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is a serious disease that threatens banana production worldwide. It is a long-standing problem in Hawaii, but previously, there was little knowledge of the causal pathogen. We isolated a strain of Foc, named Foc-UH, from a field experiencing the disease epidemic in Hawaii. Infection assays of a diverse panel of 26 banana clones, including varieties used for differentiating pathogen races and fruit production, revealed that Foc-UH has a race 1 pathogenic phenotype with an intermediate race 2 virulence and revealed the differential resistance of varieties to infection. Separate phylogenetic analyses using the barcoding regions of three nuclear genes, seven complete nuclear genes, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms within conserved whole-genome protein coding sequences placed Foc-UH into recently proposed taxonomic frameworks relevant to Foc and the F. oxysporum species complex. Screening of the 99.7\% complete draft genome identified five secreted in xylem (SIX) gene homologs: SIX1d, SIX1f, SIX9a, SIX9b, and SIX13a. This profile is similar to that of several race 1 isolates except for the absence of SIX4 and SIX6. Foc-UH was morphologically dissimilar to the nearest related isolates. Altogether, this study identified a unique isolate that causes banana Fusarium wilt, which represents the first characterization of the causal pathogen in Hawaii. The findings and genomic resources generated in this study are expected to guide banana breeding and cultivar deployment in Hawaii and beyond and contribute to further understanding of the pathogenicity and evolutionary systematics of Foc.},

 abstract = {The single curative measure for heart failure patients is a heart transplantation, which is limited due to a shortage of donors, the need for immunosuppression and economic costs. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for identifying cell populations capable of cardiac regeneration that we will be able to trace and monitor. Injury to the adult mammalian cardiac muscle, often leads to a heart attack through the irreversible loss of a large number of cardiomyocytes, due to an idle regenerative capability. Recent reports in zebrafish indicate that Tbx5a is a vital transcription factor for cardiomyocyte regeneration. Preclinical data underscore the cardioprotective role of Tbx5 upon heart failure. Data from our earlier murine developmental studies have identified a prominent unipotent Tbx5-expressing embryonic cardiac precursor cell population able to form cardiomyocytes, in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo. Using a developmental approach to an adult heart injury model and by employing a lineage-tracing mouse model as well as the use of single-cell RNA-seq technology, we identify a Tbx5-expressing ventricular cardiomyocyte-like precursor population, in the injured adult mammalian heart. The transcriptional profile of that precursor cell population is closer to that of neonatal than embryonic cardiomyocyte precursors. Tbx5, a cardinal cardiac development transcription factor, lies in the center of a ventricular adult precursor cell population, which seems to be affected by neurohormonal spatiotemporal cues. The identification of a Tbx5-specific cardiomyocyte precursor-like cell population, which is capable of dedifferentiating and potentially deploying a cardiomyocyte regenerative program, provides a clear target cell population for translationally-relevant heart interventional studies.},

 abstract = {We explored the metabolic integration of Blattella germanica and its obligate endosymbiont Blattabacterium cuenoti by the transcriptomic analysis of the fat body of quasi-aposymbiotic cockroaches, where the endosymbionts were almost entirely removed with rifampicin. Fat bodies from quasi-aposymbiotic insects displayed large differences in gene expression compared to controls. In quasi-aposymbionts, the metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine involved in cuticle sclerotization and pigmentation increased drastically to compensate for the deficiency in the biosynthesis of these amino acids by the endosymbionts. On the other hand, the uricolytic pathway and the biosynthesis of uric acid were severely decreased, probably because the reduced population of endosymbionts was unable to metabolize urea to ammonia. Metabolite transporters that could be involved in the endosymbiosis process were identified. Immune system and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression was also reduced in quasi-aposymbionts, genes encoding peptidoglycan-recognition proteins, which may provide clues for the maintenance of the symbiotic relationship, as well as three AMP genes whose involvement in the symbiotic relationship will require additional analysis. Finally, a search for AMP-like factors that could be involved in controlling the endosymbiont identified two orphan genes encoding proteins smaller than 200 amino acids underexpressed in quasi-aposymbionts, suggesting a role in the host–endosymbiont relationship.},

 abstract = {Macrophages (MΦ), known for immunological roles such as phagocytosis and antigen presentation, have been found to electrotonically couple to cardiomyocytes (CM) of the atrio-ventricular node via Cx43, affecting cardiac conduction in isolated mouse hearts. Here, we characterise passive and active electrophysiological properties of murine cardiac resident MΦ, and model their potential electrophysiological relevance for CM.We combined classic electrophysiological approaches with 3 D florescence imaging, RNA-sequencing, pharmacological interventions and computer simulations. We used Cx3cr1eYFP/+ mice wherein cardiac MΦ were fluorescently labelled. FACS-purified fluorescent MΦ from mouse hearts were studied by whole-cell patch-clamp. MΦ electrophysiological properties include: membrane resistance 2.2 ± 0.1 GΩ (all data mean±SEM), capacitance 18.3 ± 0.1 pF, resting membrane potential -39.6 ± 0.3 mV, and several voltage-activated, outward or inwardly-rectifying potassium currents. Using ion channel blockers (barium, TEA, 4-AP, margatoxin, XEN-D0103, DIDS), flow cytometry, immuno-staining and RNA-sequencing, we identified Kv1.3, Kv1.5 and Kir2.1 as channels contributing to observed ion currents. MΦ displayed four patterns for outward and two for inward-rectifier potassium currents. Additionally, MΦ showed surface expression of Cx43, a prerequisite for homo- and/or heterotypic electrotonic coupling. Experimental results fed into development of an original computational model to describe cardiac MΦ electrophysiology. Computer simulations to quantitatively assess plausible effects of MΦ on electrotonically coupled CM showed that MΦ can depolarise resting CM, shorten early and prolong late action potential duration, with effects depending on coupling strength and individual MΦ electrophysiological properties, in particular resting membrane potential and presence/absence of Kir2.1.Our results provide a first electrophysiological characterisation of cardiac resident MΦ, and a computational model to quantitatively explore their relevance in the heterocellular heart. Future work will be focussed at distinguishing electrophysiological effects of MΦ–CM coupling on both cell types during steady-state and in patho-physiological remodelling, when immune cells change their phenotype, proliferate, and/or invade from external sources.Cardiac tissue contains resident macrophages (MΦ) which, beyond immunological and housekeeping roles, have been found to electrotonically couple via connexins to cardiomyocytes (CM), stabilising atrio-ventricular conduction at high excitation rates. Here, we characterise structure and electrophysiological function of murine cardiac MΦ and provide a computational model to quantitatively probe the potential relevance of MΦ-CM coupling for cardiac electrophysiology. We find that MΦ are unlikely to have major electrophysiological effects in normal tissue, where they would hasten early and slow late CM-repolarisation. Further work will address potential arrhythmogenicity of MΦ in patho-physiologically remodelled tissue containing elevated MΦ-numbers, incl. non-resident recruited cells.},

 abstract = {Tetramethrin (TMT) is a commonly used insecticide and has a carcinogenic and neurodegenerative effect on humans. The binding mechanism and toxicological implications of TMT to human serum albumin (HSA) were examined in this study employing a combination of biophysical and computational methods indicating moderate binding affinity and potential hepato and renal toxicity. Fluorescence quenching experiments showed that TMT binds to HSA with a moderate affinity, and the binding process was spontaneous and predominantly enthalpy-driven. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that TMT binding did not induce any significant conformational changes in HSA, resulting in no changes in its alpha-helix content. The binding site and modalities of TMT interactions with HSA as computed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that it binds to Sudlow site II of HSA via hydrophobic interactions through its dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate methyl propanyl group. The structural dynamics of TMT induce proper fit into the binding site creating increased and stabilizing interactions. Additionally, molecular mechanics–Poisson Boltzmann surface area calculations also indicated that non-polar and van der Waals were found to be the major contributors to the high binding free energy of the complex. Quantum mechanics (QM) revealed the conformational energies of the binding confirmation and the degree of deviation from the global minimum energy conformation of TMT. The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the binding mechanism of TMT with HSA, which is important for evaluating the toxicity of this insecticide in humans.},

 abstract = {Aminocarb (AMC), a carbamate pesticide, due to its prevalent usage exhibits increased accumulation in the environment affecting both insects and humans. It enters the human body via food grains and be transported through bloodstream. AMC's chemical structure, containing specific molecular frameworks and functional groups, enables it to bind with proteins like albumin and hemoglobin. Given that molecules with similar architecture are known to bind with hemoglobin, we aimed to explore Aminocarb's binding capability and the potential mechanism or mode of its interaction with hemoglobin. Hb being a tetramer with a profound interface between amino acid chains offers multiple binding sites. It is therefore important to investigate the structural aspects of binding of AMC by employing various spectroscopic and in-silico methods. The surface of the α1 chain near the α1β2 interface emerges as the preferred binding site for AMC, primarily due to its conformational restrictions. In its bound state, AMC tends to maintain a relaxed conformation, closely resembling its globally optimized geometry, and resides in close proximity to the α1 chain via multiple hydrophobic contacts and water bridge as observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Fluorescence quenching experiments showed moderate binding strength (7.7×10⁴ L M⁻1 at 288 K, 7.8×10⁴ L M⁻1 at 298 K, 7.9×10⁴ L M⁻1 at 308 K) and spontaneous binding, driven by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions, as indicated by enthalpy (0.80 – 0.91 kJ mol⁻1), entropy (0.0970 – 0.0974 kJ mol⁻1), and Gibbs free energy (-27.13 to - 29.08 kJ mol⁻1). Circular dichroism experiments reveal no major structural changes in Hb. Quantum chemical calculations and MD simulations reveal conformation-dependent energy differences, enhancing our understanding of AMC's binding mechanism to Hb.},

Approximately, 10\% of the world population is facing the challenge of food allergy in direct or indirect way. In this study, a genome-wide identification and annotation of the novel putative allergen from Almond is performed. Initially, the whole proteome of Almond (31,000 proteins) was scanned by Allergenonline, a publically available database of already reported allergens from different sources. The detailed analysis suggests that there are 430 putative allergens which reduced to 45 on motif-based screening using AllFam database. These predicted allergens are annotated for their function by using PFAM, GO databases and orthology analysis. To validate our prediction, we have used structural insights of allergen and antibody interactions for one of the predicted putative allergen protein, homologous to Pru ar 3.0101allergen from Apricot. The structure of putative allergen was modeled and molecular docking studies were performed against the antibody. The best docked conformation was subjected to molecular simulation studies to confirm the stable binding of these two molecules. This detailed analysis suggests that the identified allergen will show cross reactivity similar to Pru ar 3.0101 allergen from Apricot. This is one of the first report of identifying and annotating the homologous of Pru ar 3.0101 allergen in Almond.},

 abstract = {Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are major components of eukaryotic genomes. The extensive body of evidence suggests that although they were once considered “genomic parasites”, transposons and their transcripts perform specific functions, such as regulation of early embryo development. Understanding the role of TEs in such parasites as trematodes is becoming critically important. Fasciola hepatica, a parasite affecting humans and livestock, undergoes a complex life cycle in diverse environments and hosts, and knowledge about its life cycle regulation is scarce so far. Methods: We summarized the data regarding the repetitive elements in F. hepatica and conducted bulk RNA-seq analysis across its life cycle stages. TE expression profiles were analyzed, focusing on differential expression and potential homology with previously described long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Results: Differential expression analysis revealed stage-specific TE transcription patterns, notably peaking during egg and metacercariae stages. Some TEs showed homology with known lncRNAs and contained putative transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, TE transcription levels were highest in eggs and metacercariae compared to adults, suggesting regulatory roles in trematode life cycle transitions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that TEs may play roles in regulating trematode life cycle transitions. Moreover, TE homology with lncRNAs underscores their significance in gene regulation.},

However, its application requires careful evaluation of safety traits associated with probiotic pathogenesis, including the transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes, the presence of virulence and pathogenicity factors, and the potential disruptions of the gut microbiome and immune system. In this study, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of L. paracasei FMT2 isolated from fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) capsules and performed genome annotation to assess its probiotic and safety attributes. Our comparative genomic analysis assessed this novel strain's genetic attributes and functional diversity and unraveled its evolutionary relationships with other L. paracasei strains. The assembly yielded three contigs: one corresponding to the chromosome and two corresponding to plasmids. Genome annotation revealed the presence of 2,838 DNA-coding sequences (CDS), 78 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 60 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), three non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and 126 pseudogenes. The strain lacked antibiotic resistance genes and pathogenicity factors. Two intact prophages, one Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) region, and three antimicrobial peptide gene clusters were identified, highlighting the genomic stability and antimicrobial potential of the strain. Furthermore, genes linked to probiotic functions, such as mucosal colonization, stress resistance, and biofilm formation, were characterized. The pan-genome analysis identified 3,358 orthologous clusters, including 1,775 single-copy clusters, across all L. paracasei strains. Notably, L. paracasei FMT2 contained many unique singleton genes, potentially contributing to its distinctive probiotic properties. Our findings confirm the potential of L. paracasei FMT2 for food and therapeutic applications based on its probiotic profile and safety.},

 abstract = {Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) cell use is an innovative approach for single-cell proteins (SCP) production. Coupling MES with the valorization of CO2 from anaerobic digestion and nitrogen from livestock effluents has beneficial environmental effects, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen overloading. In addition, the reducing power needed can come from surplus renewable energy. In this study, MES with a biochar-functionalized cathode was tested at varying polarizations, i.e. non polarized, -0.6 V and -1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl, and biogas-derived CO2 and recovered ammonia from pig slurry was supplied. Negative polarization switched the microbial community from heterotrophic, typical of unpolarized MES, to a mix of both heterotrophic and autotrophic/electrotrophic communities at -0.6 V and to mainly autotrophic/electrotrophic at -1.0 V. The more negative polarization allowed the highest CO2 and N capture, i.e. 39 ± 2 \% of the supplied CO2, and 6.7 ± 0.8 \% supplied N. Microbial biomass characterization indicated a protein content on dry matter basis of 33.1 ± 1.3 \% (unpolarized), 43.2 ± 0.6 \% (-0.6 V) and 69.1 ± 1.0 \% (-1.0 V). The amino acids profiles investigated showed a high nutritional value of the produced biomass, not far from those of conventional protein sources used for producing feed/food.},

 abstract = {The emerging heteropathotype shigatoxigenic (STEC) and extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) O80:H2 has been the second leading cause of pediatric HUS in France since the mid-2010s. In contrast with other highly pathogenic STEC serotypes, for which ruminants have clearly been identified as the main human infection source, this heteropathotype’s reservoir remains unknown. In this context, we describe for the first time the isolation of seven STEC O80:H2 strains from healthy cattle on a single cattle farm in France. This study aimed at (i) characterizing the genome and (ii) investigating the phylogenetic positions of these O80:H2 STEC strains. The virulomes, resistomes, and phylogenetic positions of the seven bovine isolates were investigated using in silico typing tools, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and cgMLST analysis after short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS). One representative isolate (A13P112V1) was also subjected to long-read sequencing. The seven isolates possessed ExPEC-related virulence genes on a pR444\_A-like mosaic plasmid, previously described in strain RDEx444 and known to confer multi-drug resistance. All isolates were clonally related and clustered with human clinical strains from France and Switzerland with a range of locus differences of only one to five. In conclusion, our findings suggest that healthy cattle in France could potentially act as a reservoir of the STEC-ExPEC O80:H2 pathotype.},

We are pleased to announce our 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Data Science (ICBDS – 2022) and 9th International Conference on Public Mental Health and Neurosciences (ICPMN – 2022) which was a unique conference where we connectted Biological Function through Computational Genomics to the world of integrated medicine and therapeutics. Functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. This science aims to understand the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype on a global (genome-wide) scale of different biological processes. Most researchers now study genes or regions on a “genome-wide” scale (i.e. all or multiple genes/regions at the same time), with the hope of narrowing them down to a list of candidate genes or regions to analyze in more detail. There are several specific functional genomics approaches depending on what we are focused on DNA level (genomics and epigenomics), RNA level (transcriptomics), protein level (proteomics), metabolite level (metabolomics) and phenotype level (phenomics). The recent trends in gene and genome editing technologies, promising genomic information can be modulated in the areas of medicine, agriculture and environment. Big data is a promising in many research areas, but still it is computationally challenging and non-availability of experts to handle big-data with reduced speed and cost. With the increasing use of advanced technology and the exploding amount of big-data in, it is imperative to introduce effective and efficient methods to handle big data using computing technologies. The big data analytics technique is required to solve the problems in bioinformatics such as the storage of vast information generated by analyzing the big-data. Big data analytics can examine large data sets, analyze and correlate genomic and proteomic information. Big data research finds a huge application in Neuroscience and Brain research. Our unique conference connects genomics to the world of genomics to integrated medicine including yogic sciences.},

However, bolting affects quality, gives it a bitter taste, and as a result makes it inedible. Bolting is an event induced by the coordinated effects of various environmental factors and endogenous genetic components. Although bolting/flowering responsive genes have been identified in most sensitive and non-sensitive species, non-coding RNA molecules like long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have not been investigated in lettuce. Hence, in this study, potential long non-coding RNAs that regulate flowering /bolting were investigated in two lettuce strains S24 (resistant strain) and S39 (susceptible strain) in different flowering times to better understand the regulation of lettuce bolting mechanism. For this purpose, we used two RNA-seq datasets to discover the lncRNA transcriptome profile during the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase.},

Next-generation sequencing has transformed the diagnosis of IEM, leading to its proposed use as a second-tier technology for confirming cases detected by clinical/biochemical studies or newborn screening. The diagnosis rate is, however, still not 100\%. This paper reports the use of a personalized multi-omics (metabolomic, genomic and transcriptomic) pipeline plus functional genomics to aid in the genetic diagnosis of six unsolved cases, with a clinical and/or biochemical diagnosis of galactosemia, mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), citrullinemia, or urea cycle deficiency. Eight novel variants in six genes were identified: six (four of them deep intronic) located in GALE, IDUA, PTS, ASS1 and OTC, all affecting the splicing process, and two located in the promoters of IDUA and PTS, thus affecting these genes’ expression. All the new variants were subjected to functional analysis to verify their pathogenic effects. This work underscores how the combination of different omics technologies and functional analysis can solve elusive cases in clinical practice.},

 abstract = {The last few decades have seen a massive use of antibiotics worldwide, in all from human health care and veterinary use to agriculture and aquaculture. This has led to a rise in emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), where bacteria harbouring genes for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenem resistance are of particular concern. Infectious diseases caused by these bacteria can be very challenging to treat, and a staggering number of deaths every year result directly or indirectly from antibiotic resistance. With no measurements taken to stop the ARB spread, this problem will only keep on growing. 

This study aimed to investigate the existence of ARBs in six different water habitats from the southwestern and southeastern part of Norway. By the help of ESBL and CRE agar screening plates, ARB were isolated from all water sites. The DNA from a total of 20 bacterial isolate was extracted, and identified through Sanger sequencing. Multiplex and singleplex PCR were performed, using primer pairs of known ESBLs and carbapenemases, to identify the presence of these genes. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on 13 of the isolates, out of which three were chosen for whole genome sequencing.

Eight different bacterial genera were identified, namely Caulobacter, Chonella, Chromobacterium, Herbaspirillum, Novosphingobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Stenotrophomonas. The WGS results revealed two certain, and three putative β-lactamase genes present in the three bacteria that were sequenced. These were a class A β-lactamase gene in Caulobacter, blaFONA-8 and blaSFDC in Serratia, and blaL1 and blaL2 in Stenotrophomonas. This revealed that β-lactam resistant bacteria can be found in various water habitats in the southern part of Norway.},

 abstract = {Amidst the current biodiversity crisis, the availability of genomic resources for declining species can provide important insights into the factors driving population decline. In the early 1990s, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a pelagic gull widely distributed across the arctic, subarctic, and temperate zones, suffered a steep population decline following an abrupt warming of sea surface temperature across its distribution range and is currently listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Kittiwakes have long been the focus for field studies of physiology, ecology, and ecotoxicology and are primary indicators of fluctuating ecological conditions in arctic and subarctic marine ecosystems. We present a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome and annotation for the black-legged kittiwake using a combination of Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing, Bionano optical maps, Hi-C reads, and RNA-Seq data. The final assembly spans 1.35 Gb across 32 chromosomes, with a scaffold N50 of 88.21 Mb and a BUSCO completeness of 97.4\%. This genome assembly substantially improves the quality of a previous draft genome, showing an approximately 5× increase in contiguity and a more complete annotation. Using this new chromosome-level reference genome and three more chromosome-level assemblies of Charadriiformes, we uncover several lineage-specific chromosome fusions and fissions, but find no shared rearrangements, suggesting that interchromosomal rearrangements have been commonplace throughout the diversification of Charadriiformes. This new high-quality genome assembly will enable population genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotype–genotype association studies in a widely studied sentinel species, which may provide important insights into the impacts of global change on marine systems.},

 abstract = {Globe artichoke ecotypes sanitized from plant pathogen infections are characterized by high vegetative vigor, productivity, and quality of capitula. The recent availability on the market of these plants has renewed the interest of farmers and pharmaceutical industries in the crop. Globe artichoke exhibits interesting nutraceutical properties due to the high content of health-promoting bioactive compounds (BACs), such as polyphenols, that could be extracted from waste biomass. The production of BACs depends on several factors including the plant portion considered, the globe artichoke variety/ecotype, and the physiological status of the plants, linked to biotic and abiotic stresses. We investigated the influence of viral infections on polyphenol accumulation in two Apulian late-flowering ecotypes “Locale di Mola tardivo” and “Troianella”, comparing sanitized virus-free material (S) vs. naturally virus-infected (non-sanitized, NS) plants. Transcriptome analysis of the two ecotypes highlighted that differentially expressed genes (DEGs), in the two tested conditions, were mainly involved in primary metabolism and processing of genetic/environmental information. The up-regulation of the genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and the analysis of peroxidase activity suggested that their modulation is influenced by the phytosanitary status of the plant and is ecotype-dependent. Conversely, the phytochemical analysis showed a remarkable decrease in polyphenols and lignin accumulation in S artichokes compared to NS plants. This unique study analyzes the potential of growing vigorous, sanitized plants, in order to have high amounts of ‘soft and clean’ biomass, finalized for BAC extraction for nutraceutical purposes. This, in turn, opens new perspectives for a circular economy of sanitized artichokes, in line with the current phytosanitary standards and sustainable development goals.},

 abstract = {Plant tissue in vitro culture is increasingly used in agriculture to improve crop production, nutritional quality, and commercial value. In plant virology, the technique is used as sanitation protocol to produce virus-free plants. Sanitized (S) artichokes show increased vigour compared to their non-sanitized (NS) counterparts, because viral infections lead to a decline of growth and development. To investigate mechanisms that control the complex traits related to morphology, growth, and yield in S artichokes compared to NS plants, RNAseq analysis and phenotyping by imaging were used. The role of peroxidases (POD) was also investigated to understand their involvement in sanitized plant development. Results showed that virus infection affected regulation of cell cycle, gene expression and signal transduction modulating cellular response to stimulus/stress. Moreover, primary metabolism and photosynthesis were also influenced, contributing to explain the main morphological differences observed between S and NS artichokes. Sanitized artichokes are also characterized by higher POD activity, probably associated with increased plant growth, rather than strengthening of cell walls. Overall, results show that the differences in development of S artichokes may be derived from the in vitro culture stressor, as well as through pathogen elimination, which, in turn, improve qualitative and quantitative artichoke production.},

 abstract = {Globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus L. subsp. scolymus) is an important crop of the Mediterranean basin characterized by many properties, like hepatoprotective, anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, antibacterial, and beneficial to human health. The high bioactive compounds (BACs) content, as polyphenols, has attracted the research interest in artichoke extracts. We analysed the changes in polyphenol transcriptome profile between sanitized (S) virus-free and non-sanitized (NS) artichoke plants, focusing on genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway and flavonoid biosynthesis. A total of 2458 upregulated and 2154 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were functionally characterized. Among them, 31 and 35 KEGG orthology entries characterized by upregulated and downregulated DEGs, respectively, were involved in the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. A downregulation of PAL, C4H, 4CL, HST/HQT, C3′H, CCoAMT, CCR1, and F5H, was observed in S artichoke compared to NS one, whereas the CSE, CHS, and CHI genes were upregulated in S samples. Transcriptome results were compared to the polyphenols accumulation in S and NS artichoke leaves. A higher content of total polyphenols was observed in older leaves of NS samples, compared to extracts obtained from young leaves or from S plants, and this result was associated with the presence of viral infections in NS plants. In all the conditions tested, the most represented compound was chlorogenic acid, followed by luteolin-7-O-glucoside. The different composition of each extract was evaluated by a polyphenol dose–response treatment on the rodent hepatoma FaO cell line to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A significant reduction in ROS content ranging between −40\% and −48\% was observed when 10–20 mg/L of polyphenols from NS or S plants were used, characterized by a specific profile of compounds. To reduce MetOH residues in polyphenol extracts, a supercritical fluid CO2 extraction was evaluated to propose a sustainable green extraction.},

 abstract = {This work monitored the effect of a municipal and a village wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) technology on the fate of beta-lactam resistance genes in bacterial populations in different phases of the wastewater treatment process. In case of the municipal WWTP1, the bacteria possessing a high ampicillin resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 20 mg/mL) accumulated in the sedimentation tank, which was accompanied with a higher concentration of ampicillin in the wastewater samples (28.09 ng/L) and an increase in the relative abundance of the blaTEM gene in the bacterial population. However, an opposite trend was revealed with the blaNDM-1 gene, making the sedimentation processes of WWTP1 crucial only for the accumulation of the blaTEM gene. Similarly, the comparison with the WWTP2 showed that the accumulation of the ampicillin resistance in bacterial population probably depended on the WWTP technology and wastewater composition. Out of the four tested resistance genes (blaTEM, blaKPC, blaNDM-1, and blaOXA-48), blaTEM and blaNDM-1 genes were the only two detected in this study. According to NGS analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene, Gammaproteobacteria dominated the ampicillin-resistant bacteria of the WWTP sedimentation tanks. Their relative abundance in the bacterial population also increased during the sedimentation processes in WWTP1. It could indicate the role of the bacterial taxon in ampicillin resistance accumulation in this WWTP and show that only 9.29\% of the original bacterial population from the nitrification tank is involved in the documented shifts in beta-lactam resistance of the bacterial population.},

 abstract = {The genus Topiris Walker, 1863 is revised. This genus, previously neglected or deemed unrecognisable, comprised only Walker’s damaged and misrepaired type specimen of Topiris candidella Walker, 1863. Evidence is provided that this specimen was collected by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1855–56 in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. The mitogenome of this specimen was assembled using low coverage whole genome sequencing (genome skimming). The COI-5P portion of this mitogenome (658 bp) differs by 1–3 bp from two haplotypes sequenced from early 1990’s Brunei specimens. Another specimen recently discovered at NHMUK with an identical label to that of the type perfectly matches the Brunei specimens in its genitalia. Based on these four specimens, we present a fuller description of the morphology of T. candidella. Topiris includes the following additional species authored by Sterling and Lees: Topiris albidella sp. nov., T. albogrisella sp. nov., T. cinderella sp. nov., T. digiticosta sp. nov., T. lacteella sp. nov., T. madonna sp. nov., T. meyricki sp. nov., T. ochrotincta sp. nov., T. schneeweissella sp. nov., T. sericella sp. nov., and T. thunbergella sp. nov. The following new combinations are also established: T. salva (Meyrick, 1932), comb. nov. and T. sampitella (Lvovsky, 2014), comb. nov. The type of Athrypsiastis salva Meyrick is confirmed as lost and so a neotype and paraneotype of this species are designated. A published mitogenome of “Linoclostis gonatias” is shown to be correctly identified as T. salva, and references to L. gonatias, identified in some literature as a pest of Theaceae, are likely misidentified. The genus Topiris is divided into three groups, the candidella group, the salva group, and the albidella group, based on characters in the male genitalia. The candidella group and albidella group are supported sub-clades of Topiris. The phylogenetic placement of Topiris and Athrypsiastis within ‘core’ Xyloryctidae (as subtended by its type species, X. luteotactella) is confirmed by analysis of COI and seven nuclear genes, whereas the genera Eumenodora Meyrick, 1906 and Izatha Walker, 1864 do not fall within this clade. The morphology of Athrypsiastis phaeoleuca Meyrick, 1910 (the type species of Athrypsiastis; Xyloryctidae) is more fully described. The following new species authored by Sterling and Lees are described: Athrypsiastis cheesmanae sp. nov., A. edelweissella sp. nov., and A. penumbrella sp. nov. Two taxa are newly combined: Athrypsiastis halmaherella (Lvovsky, 2014), comb. nov. and Paralecta rosiflora (Meyrick, 1930), comb. nov.},

@article{stillger_neoadjuvant_2024,
 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer, often diagnosed at stages that dis-qualify for surgical resection. Neoadjuvant therapies offer potential tumor regression and improved resectability. Although features of the tumor biology (e.g., molecular markers) may guide adjuvant therapy, biological alterations after neoadjuvant therapy remain largely unexplored. We performed mass spectrometry to characterize the proteomes of 67 PDAC resection specimens of patients who received either neoadjuvant chemo (NCT) or chemo-radiation (NCRT) therapy. We employed data-independent acquisition (DIA), yielding a proteome coverage in excess of 3500 proteins. Moreover, we successfully integrated two publicly available proteome datasets of treatment-naïve PDAC to unravel proteome alterations in response to neoadjuvant therapy, highlighting the feasibility of this approach. We found highly distinguishable proteome profiles. Treatment-naïve PDAC was characterized by enrichment of immunoglobulins, complement and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Post-NCT and post-NCRT PDAC presented high abundance of ribosomal and metabolic proteins as compared to treatment-naïve PDAC. Further analyses on patient survival and protein expression identified treatment-specific prognostic candidates. We present the first proteomic characterization of the residual PDAC mass after NCT and NCRT, and potential protein candidate markers associated with overall survival. We conclude that residual PDAC exhibits fundamentally different proteome profiles as compared to treatment-naïve PDAC, influenced by the type of neoadjuvant treatment. These findings may impact adjuvant or targeted therapy options.},

@article{stojkovic_targeted_2024,
 abstract = {Detrimental molecular processes in multiple sclerosis (MS) lead to the cellular accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and iron in the CNS, which represents the main driving force for ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, with proposed roles in neurodegeneration, oligodendrocyte loss and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of MS. Ferroptosis-related gene expression signature and molecular markers, which could reflect MS severity and progression, are currently understudied in humans. To tackle these challenges, we have applied a curated approach to create and experimentally analyze a comprehensive panel of ferroptosis-related genes covering a wide range of biological processes associated with ferroptosis. We performed the first ferroptosis-related targeted RNAseq on PBMCs from highly distinctive MS phenotype groups: mild relapsing–remitting (RR) (n = 24) and severe secondary progressive (SP) (n = 24), along with protein detection of GPX4 and products of lipid peroxidation (MDA and 4-HNE). Out of 138 genes, 26 were differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicating changes in both pro- and anti-ferroptotic genes, representing a molecular signature associated with MS severity. The top three DEGs, as non-core ferroptosis genes, CDKN1A, MAP1B and EGLN2, were replicated by qPCR to validate findings in independent patient groups (16 RR and 16 SP MS). Co-expression and interactions of DEGs were presented as additional valuable assets for deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and key targets related to MS severity. Our study integrates a wide genetic signature and biochemical markers related to ferroptosis in easily obtainable PBMCs of MS patients with clinical data and disease severity, thus providing novel molecular markers which can complement disease-related changes in the brain and undergo further research as potential therapeutic targets.},

 abstract = {Abstract The present study aimed to explore the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of biofilm formation in Bulgarian nosocomial Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates (n = 221) during the period 2011–2022, by screening for the presence of biofilm-associated genes (BAG) (spgM, rmlA and rpfF), their mutational variability, and assessment of the adherent growth on a polystyrene surface. The methodology included: PCR amplification, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and crystal violet microtiter plate assay for biofilm quantification. The overall incidence of BAG was: spgM 98.6\%, rmlA 86\%, and rpfF 66.5\%. The most prevalent genotype was spgM+/rmlA+/rpfF+ (56.1\%), followed by spgM+/rmlA+/rpfF- (28.5\%), and spgM+/rmlA-/rpfF+ (9.5\%), with their significant predominance in lower respiratory tract isolates compared to those with other origin (P {\textless} 0.001). All strains examined were characterized as strong biofilm producers (OD550 from 0.224 ± 0.049 to 2.065 ± 0.023) with a single exception that showed a weak biofilm-forming ability (0.177 ± 0.024). No significant differences were observed in the biofilm formation according to the isolation source, as well as among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 isolates (1.256 ± 0.028 vs. 1.348 ± 0.128, respectively). Also, no correlation was found between the biofilm amounts and the corresponding genotypes. WGS showed that the rmlA accumulated a larger number of variants (0.0086 per base) compared to the other BAG, suggesting no critical role of its product to the biofilm formation. Additionally, two of the isolates were found to harbour class 1 integrons (7-kb and 2.6-kb sized, respectively) containing sul1 in their 3′ conservative ends, which confers sulfonamide resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on S. maltophilia biofilm formation in Bulgaria, which also identifies novel sequence types (ST819, ST820 and ST826). It demonstrates the complex nature of this adaptive mechanism in the multifactorial pathogenesis of biofilm-associated infections.},

 abstract = {Abstract Cefiderocol (CFDC) is a first-in-class siderophore cephalosporin with potent activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The present study aimed to explore the CFDC resistance mechanisms of an extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate from Bulgaria. The A. baumannii Aba52 strain (designated Aba52) was obtained in 2018 from a blood sample of a critically ill patient. The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenomic analysis. The isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to CFDC (MIC = 64 mg L−1), resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tigecycline, as well as susceptibility only to colistin. WGS-based resistome analysis revealed the existence of blaOXA-23, blaOXA-66 and blaADC-73. Seven non-conservative missense mutations affecting iron transport-related genes were detected: exbD4 (p.Ser61Pro), tonB2 (p.Ala268Val), bauA (p.Thr61Ala), ftsI (p.Ala515Val), piuA (p.Gly216Val), and feoB (p.Ser429Pro and p.Thr595Ala). A variety of virulence factors associated with adherence, biofilm formation, enzyme production, immune invasion, iron uptake, quorum sensing, and two-component regulatory systems were identified, suggesting a significant pathogenic potential of Aba52. The performed RT-qPCR analysis showed diminished (0.17) and absent expression of the pirA and piuA genes, respectively, encoding TonB-dependent siderophore receptors. Aba52 belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence type ST2 (Pasteur scheme). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of CFDC-resistant A. baumannii in Bulgaria even though, CFDC has never been applied in our country. The emerging resistance highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance targeting the implementation of novel antibiotics.},

The present study aimed to explore the linezolid resistance mechanisms and genomic characteristics of two vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis isolates from Bulgaria. The strains designated Efs2503-bg (inpatient from Pleven) and Efs966-bg (outpatient from Varna) were recovered from wounds in 2018 and 2023, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenomic analysis based on 332 linezolid-resistant E. faecalis genomes were performed. Efs2503-bg was high-level resistant to linezolid (MIC {\textgreater} 256 mg/L) and displayed the G2576T mutation affecting three of the four 23S rDNA loci. Efs966-bg (MIC = 8 mg/L) carried a plasmid-located optrA determinant surrounded by fexA and ermA. No mutations in the genes encoding for ribosomal proteins L3, L4, and L22 were detected. The isolates belonged to the sequence types ST6 (Efs2503-bg) and ST1102 (Efs966-bg). Phylogenomic analysis revealed that Efs2503-bg and Efs966-bg are genetically distinct, with a difference of 12,051 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To our knowledge, this is the first report of linezolid-resistant enterococci in Bulgaria. Although the global incidence of linezolid-resistant enterococci is still low, their emergence is alarming and poses a growing clinical threat to public health.},

The present study aimed to explore the genomic characteristics of two Vietnamese extended-spectrum β-lactamase-9 (VEB-9)-producing XDR-PA isolates from Bulgaria in comparison to all blaVEB-9-positive strains with available genomes. The isolates designated Pae51 and Pae52 were obtained from tracheobronchial aspirates of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, RT-qPCR, and phylogenomic analysis were performed. Pae51 and Pae52 were resistant to most antipseudomonal β-lactams including carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones but remained susceptible to colistin and cefiderocol. Numerous resistance determinants were detected: blaVEB-9, blaPDC-3, blaOXA-10, blaOXA-50, aac(6′)-II, ant(2″)-Ia, ant(3″)-IIa, aph(3′)-IIb, cprP, catB7, dfrB2, sul1, fosA, and tet(A). Both isolates carried complex integrons with blaVEB-9 and tet(A) embedded next to the conservative 3′ end sequences. A variety of virulence factors were also identified, including the type III secretion system exotoxin U. Pae51 and Pae52 differed by only four SNPs and belonged to the high-risk clone ST357. To our knowledge, this is the first report of blaVEB-9-positive XDR-PA isolates in Bulgaria presenting a detailed genomic analysis. The development of novel antimicrobial strategies for such pathogens should be an essential part of infection control stewardship practices in ICU wards.},

PCR amplification, enzymatic assays, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and biofilm quantification on a polystyrene plate were performed. The incidence of virulence determinants was as follows: stmPr1 (encoding for the major extracellular protease StmPr1) 87.3\%, stmPr2 (minor extracellular protease StmPr2) 99.1\%, Smlt3773 locus (outer membrane esterase) 98.2\%, plcN1 (non-hemolytic phospholipase C) 99.1\%, and smf-1 (type-1 fimbriae, biofilm-related gene) 96.4\%. The 1621-bp allele of stmPr1 was most frequently found (61.1\%), followed by the combined allelic variant (17.6\%), stmPr1-negative genotype (12.7\%), and 868-bp allele (8.6\%). Protease, esterase, and lecithinase activity was observed in 95\%, 98.2\%, and 17.2\% of the isolates, respectively. The WGS-subjected isolates (n = 9) formed two groups. Five isolates possessed only the 1621-bp variant of stmPr1, higher biofilm formation ability (Optical Density at λ = 550 nm (OD550): 1.253–1.789), as well as a low number of mutations in the protease genes and smf-1. Three other isolates had only the 868-bp variant, weaker biofilm production (OD550: 0.788–1.108), and higher number of mutations within these genes. The only weak biofilm producer (OD550 = 0.177) had no stmPr1 alleles. In conclusion, the similar PCR detection rates did not allow differentiation of the isolates. In contrast, WGS permitted stmPr1 alleles-based differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Bulgarian study presenting genotypic and phenotypic insights into virulence factors of S. maltophilia isolates.},

The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenomic analysis. The resistance rates were as follows: imipenem, 100\%; meropenem, 100\%; amikacin, 98.6\%; gentamicin, 89\%; tobramycin, 86.3\%; levofloxacin, 100\%; trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, 75.3\%; tigecycline, 86.3\%; colistin, 0\%; and ampicillin–sulbactam, 13.7\%. All isolates harbored blaOXA-51-like genes.

Various insertion sequencies, such as ISAba24, ISAba31, ISAba125, ISVsa3, IS17, and IS6100, were also detected, providing increased ability for horizontal transfer of ARGs. The isolates belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence types ST2 (n = 2) and ST636 (n = 1) (Pasteur scheme).

 abstract = {The circulation of Omicron BA.1 led to the rapid increase in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in South Africa in November 2021, which warranted the use of more rapid detection methods. We, therefore, assessed the ability to detect Omicron BA.1 using genotyping assays to identify specific mutations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, Gauteng province, South Africa. The TaqPath™ COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was performed on all samples selected to identify spike gene target failure (SGTF). SARS-CoV-2 genotyping assays were used for the detection of del69/70 and K417N mutation. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on a subset of genotyped samples to confirm these findings. Of the positive samples received, 11.0\% (175/1589) were randomly selected to assess if SGTF and genotyping assays, that detect del69/70 and K417N mutations, could identify Omicron BA.1. We identified SGTF in 98.9\% (173/175) of samples, of which 88.0\% (154/175) had both the del69/70 and K417N mutation. The genotyped samples (45.7\%; 80/175) that were sequenced confirmed Omicron BA.1 (97.5\%; 78/80). Our data show that genotyping for the detection of the del69/70 and K417N coupled with SGTF is efficient to exclude Alpha and Beta variants and rapidly detect Omicron BA.1. However, we still require assays for the detection of unique mutations that will allow for the differentiation between other Omicron sublineages. Therefore, the use of genotyping assays to detect new dominant or emerging lineages of SARS-CoV-2 will be beneficial in limited-resource settings.},

 abstract = {Intra-host diversity studies are used to characterise the mutational heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in order to understand the impact of virus-host adaptations. This study investigated the frequency and diversity of the spike (S) protein mutations within SARS-CoV-2 infected South African individuals. The study included SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples, from individuals of all ages, received at the National Health Laboratory Service at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic hospital, Gauteng, South Africa, from June 2020 to May 2022. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays and whole genome sequencing were performed on a random selection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The allele frequency (AF) was determined using TaqMan Genotyper software for SNP PCR analysis and galaxy.eu for analysis of FASTQ reads from sequencing. The SNP assays identified 5.3\% (50/948) of Delta cases with heterogeneity at delY144 (4\%; 2/50), E484Q (6\%; 3/50), N501Y (2\%; 1/50) and P681H (88\%; 44/50), however only heterogeneity for E484Q and delY144 were confirmed by sequencing. From sequencing we identified 9\% (210/2381) of cases with Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, BA.2.15, and BA.4 lineages that had heterogeneity in the S protein. Heterogeneity was primarily identified at positions 19 (1.4\%) with T19IR (AF 0.2–0.7), 371 (92.3\%) with S371FP (AF 0.1–1.0), and 484 (1.9\%) with E484AK (0.2–0.7), E484AQ (AF 0.4–0.5) and E484KQ (AF 0.1–0.4). Mutations at heterozygous amino acid positions 19, 371 and 484 are known antibody escape mutations, however the impact of the combination of multiple substitutions identified at the same position is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesise that intra-host SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with heterogeneity in the S protein facilitate competitive advantage of variants that can completely/partially evade host’s natural and vaccine-induced immune responses.},

In this study, through in-silico transcriptome analysis of drug-treated M. tuberculosis samples, novel drug targets for the treatment of drug resistance in tuberculosis were identified. Gene expression datasets of tuberculosis patients samples treated with different antibiotics (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Bedaquiline and Linezolid) were considered in this study. DESeq2 was used to identify the differentially regulated genes. Novel genes which were up-regulated during antibiotic treatment were identified which could be antibiotic resistance factors. Further, to understand the resistance mechanism of the novel genes, we performed gene ontology and gene network analysis for the differentially up-regulated genes. Thus, the in-silico transcriptome analysis paves way for a deeper understanding of the antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis.},

Their epidemic and pandemic clones often accumulate useful accessory genes in their genomes, such as AMR genes (ARGs) and virulence factor genes (VFGs). This process is facilitated by horizontal gene transfer among microbial communities via mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids and phages. Nanopore long-read sequencing allows easy and inexpensive analysis of complex bacterial genome structures, although some aspects of sequencing data calculation and genome analysis methods are not systematically understood. Here we describe the latest and most recommended experimental and bioinformatics methods available for the construction of complete bacterial genomes from nanopore sequencing data and the detection and classification of genotypes of bacterial chromosomes, ARGs, VFGs, plasmids, and other MGEs based on their genomic sequences for genomic epidemiological analysis of AMR bacteria.},

In 2017, a higher quality genome assembly for apple was released and is now considered to be the reference genome. Moreover, as in several other species, the identified TCP genes were named based on the relative position of the genes on the chromosomes. The present work consists of an update of the TCP gene family based on the latest genome assembly of M. × domestica. Compared to the previous classification, the number of TCP genes decreased from 52 to 40 as a result of the addition of three sequences and the deduction of 15. An analysis of the intragenic identity led to the identification of 15 pairs of orthologs, shedding light on the forces that shaped the evolution of this gene family. Furthermore, a revised nomenclature system is proposed that is based both on the intragenic identity and the homology with Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) TCPs in an effort to set a common standard for the TCP classification that will facilitate any future interspecific analysis.},

 abstract = {Vibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly associated with mackerel poisoning. A bacteriophage that specifically targets and lyses this bacterium could be employed as a biocontrol agent for treating the bacterial infection or improving the shelf-life of mackerel products. However, only a few well-characterized V. alginolyticus phages have been reported in the literature. In this study, a novel lytic phage, named ΦImVa-1, specifically infecting V. alginolyticus strain ATCC 17749, was isolated from Indian mackerel. The phage has a short latent period of 15 min and a burst size of approximately 66 particles per infected bacterium. ΦImVa-1 remained stable for 2 h at a wide temperature (27–75 °C) and within a pH range of 5 to 10. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that ΦImVa-1 has an icosahedral head of approximately 60 nm in diameter with a short tail, resembling those in the Schitoviridae family. High throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis elucidated that ΦImVa-1 has a linear dsDNA genome of 77,479 base pairs (bp), with a G + C content of {\textasciitilde} 38.72\% and 110 predicted gene coding regions (106 open reading frames and four tRNAs). The genome contains an extremely large virion-associated RNA polymerase gene and two smaller non-virion-associated RNA polymerase genes, which are hallmarks of schitoviruses. No antibiotic genes were found in the ΦImVa-1 genome. This is the first paper describing the biological properties, morphology, and the complete genome of a V. alginolyticus-infecting schitovirus. When raw mackerel fish flesh slices were treated with ΦImVa-1, the pathogen loads reduced significantly, demonstrating the potential of the phage as a biocontrol agent for V. alginolyticus strain ATCC 17749 in the food.},

 abstract = {Tempe, a fermented soybean product, plays a significant role in Indonesian dietary culture. Currently, there have been no studies that classify tempe as a functional food using up-to-date genomic data. This research used an Illumina-based meta-transcriptomic method to explore the microbial communities that mainly contribute to tempe fermentation and their functions related to its health benefits. The analysis revealed 8 phyla, 19 families, 20 genera, and 28 species of both bacteria and fungi. The dominant species found were Klebsiella africana, followed by Rhizopus microsporus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhizopus oligosporus, Propionibacterium humerusii, and Lactobacillus brevis. Klebsiella and Propionibacterium are involved in vitamin B12 production, while Rhizopus is associated with GABA production and isoflavones like genistein and daidzein, along with spermidine, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acid. Lactobacillus contributes proteases, GABA, and beta-glucosidase. The study also strengthened the link between microbes and health benefits by identifying certain microbial genes and their expression levels in the samples. Changes in gene expression reveal how fermentation environments affect diversity and functionality. Overall, finding a variety of bioactive compounds and their genetic backgrounds supports tempe’s position as a functional superfood that could gain global popularity through further research and development.},

 abstract = {Abstract The essential splicing factor U2AF65 is known to help anchoring U2 snRNP at the branch site. Its C-terminal UHM domain interacts with ULM motifs of SF3b155, an U2 snRNP protein. Here, we report a cooperative binding of U2AF65 and the related protein CAPERα to the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. In addition, we show that the RS domain of U2AF65 drives a liquid?liquid phase separation that is amplified by intronic RNA with repeated pyrimidine tracts. In cells, knockdown of either U2AF65 or CAPERα improves the inclusion of cassette exons that are preceded by such repeated pyrimidine-rich motifs. These results support a model in which liquid-like assemblies of U2AF65 and CAPERα on repetitive pyrimidine-rich RNA sequences are driven by their RS domains, and facilitate the recruitment of the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. We anticipate that posttranslational modifications and proteins recruited in dynamical U2AF65 and CAPERα condensates may further contribute to the complex mechanisms leading to specific splice site choice that occurs in cells.},

 abstract = {The WHIRLY (WHY) family of DNA/RNA binding proteins fulfil multiple but poorly characterised functions in plants. We analysed WHY protein functions in the Arabidopsis Atwhy1, Atwhy3, Atwhy1why3 single and double mutants and wild type controls. The Atwhy3 and Atwhy1why3 double mutants showed a significant delay in flowering, having more siliques per plant but with fewer seeds per silique than the wild type. While germination was similar in the unaged high-quality seeds of all lines, significant decreases in vigour and viability were observed in the aged mutant seeds compared with the wild type. Imbibition of unaged high-quality seeds was characterised by large increases in transcripts that encode proteins involved in oxygen sensing and responses to hypoxia. Seed aging resulted in a disruption of the imbibition-induced transcriptome profile such that transcripts encoding RNA metabolism and processing became the most abundant components of the imbibition signature. The imbibition-related profile of the Atwhy1why3 mutant seeds, was characterised by decreased expression of hypoxia-related and oxygen metabolism genes even in the absence of aging. Seed aging further decreased the abundance of hypoxia-related and oxygen metabolism transcripts relative to the wild type. These findings suggest that the WHY1 and WHY3 proteins regulate the imbibition-induced responses to oxygen availability and hypoxia. Loss of WHY1 and WHY3 functions decreases the ability of Arabidopsis seeds to resist the adverse effects of seed aging.},

UHCC 0315, a species occurring not only in freshwater environments but also in brackish water. Comparative genomics analyses revealed a close association with Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0090 isolated from a lake in Finland. The genome closure of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315 unraveled a mixture of two subtypes in the original culture, and subtypes exhibited distinct buoyancy phenotypes. Salinity less than 3 g L−1 NaCl enabled proper growth of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, whereas growth was arrested at moderate salinity (6 g L−1 NaCl). The concentrations of toxins, microcystins, increased at moderate salinity, whereas RNA sequencing data implied that Dolichospermum remodeled its primary metabolism in unfavorable high salinity. Based on our results, the predicted salinity decrease in the Baltic Sea may favor toxic blooms of Dolichospermum spp.},

 abstract = {The vast ecosystem of single-cell RNA-sequencing tools has until recently been plagued by an excess of diverging analysis strategies, inconsistent file formats, and compatibility issues between different software suites. The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing requirements and the statistically driven methods needed to process and understand these ever-growing datasets.Here we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for single-cell RNA-sequencing, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal.The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms. The tutorials from the Galaxy Training Network along with the frequent training workshops hosted by the Galaxy community provide a means for users to learn, publish, and teach single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis.},

 abstract = {The mitochondrial genomes of apicomplexans comprise merely three protein-coding genes, alongside a set of thirty to forty genes encoding small RNAs (sRNAs), many of which exhibit homologies to rRNA from E. coli. The expression status and integration of these short RNAs into ribosomes remains unclear and direct evidence for active ribosomes within apicomplexan mitochondria is still lacking. In this study, we conducted small RNA sequencing on the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii to investigate the occurrence and function of mitochondrial sRNAs. To enhance the analysis of sRNA sequencing outcomes, we also re-sequenced the T. gondii mitochondrial genome using an improved organelle enrichment protocol and Nanopore sequencing. It has been established previously that the T. gondii genome comprises 21 sequence blocks that undergo recombination among themselves but that their order is not entirely random. The enhanced coverage of the mitochondrial genome allowed us to characterize block combinations at increased resolution. Employing this refined genome for sRNA mapping, we find that many small RNAs originated from the junction sites between protein-coding blocks and rRNA sequence blocks. Surprisingly, such block border sRNAs were incorporated into polysomes together with canonical rRNA fragments and mRNAs. In conclusion, apicomplexan ribosomes are active within polysomes and are indeed assembled through the integration of sRNAs, including previously undetected sRNAs with merged mRNA-rRNA sequences. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that T. gondii’s block-based genome organization enables the dual utilization of mitochondrial sequences as both messenger RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, potentially establishing a link between the regulation of rRNA and mRNA expression.},

 abstract = {Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study investigates transcriptomic alterations in rodent models of ICH and severe ICH to shed light on the genetic pathways involved in hemorrhagic brain injury. We performed principal component analysis, revealing distinct principal component segments of normal rats compared to ICH and severe ICH rats. We employed heatmaps and volcano plots to identify differentially expressed genes and utilized bar plots and KEGG pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular pathways involved. We identified a multitude of differentially expressed genes in both the ICH and severe ICH models. Our results revealed 5679 common genes among the normal, ICH, and severe ICH groups in the upregulated genes group, and 1196 common genes in the downregulated genes, respectively. A volcano plot comparing these groups further highlighted common genes, including PDPN, TIMP1, SERPINE1, TUBB6, and CD44. These findings underscore the complex interplay of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis uncovered key signaling pathways, including the TNF signaling pathway, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, MAPK signaling pathway, and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, implicated in the pathogenesis of ICH.},

In this study, the efficacy of anaerobic fungal consortia (AFC) from five different inocula, including Bubalus bubalis rumen fluid (RU), in degrading filter paper, microcrystalline cellulose, and rice straw (RS), was screened. The AFC from RU performed best in lignocellulosic material degradation and methane production; thus, RU was selected for further experiments. Consecutive batch subculturing (CBS) was performed in RU to enrich and stabilize the dominant and key microorganisms categorized as anaerobic fungi, using the addition of antibacterial agents to suppress the growth of untargeted bacteria. After the CBS, subculture E19 proved the most efficient, with RS degradation of 84\% and a methane yield of 310 mL/g VSadded, representing 1.83- and 2.25-fold increases compared to the initial seed, respectively. The microbial community of E19 consisted of anaerobic fungi (uncultured Neocallimastigales, Anaeromyces sp., Orpinomyces sp., and Feramyces sp.) coexisting with anaerobic bacteria (streptomycin resistant Proteiniphilum acetatigenes), and methanogens. The E19 consortium was able to use various carbon sources (87.5\%) and contained potential genes encoding enzymes involved in RS degradation. The microbial community of E19 was highly stable, making it a promising inoculum for biomass degradation, especially for anaerobic digestion to produce biogas.},

Previous work has shown that myelin debris can overwhelm the metabolic capacity of microglia, thereby impeding tissue regeneration in aging, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In a model of demyelination, we found that a substantial number of genes that were not effectively activated in aged myeloid cells displayed epigenetic modifications associated with restricted chromatin accessibility. Ablation of two class I histone deacetylases in microglia was sufficient to restore the capacity of aged mice to remyelinate lesioned tissue. We used Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a live-attenuated vaccine, to train the innate immune system and detected epigenetic reprogramming of brain-resident myeloid cells and functional restoration of myelin debris clearance and lesion recovery. Our results provide insight into aging-associated decline in myeloid function and how this decay can be prevented by innate immune reprogramming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Subtle modifications in such early events are likely to have major impacts in later morphogenesis, bringing along morphological diversification. Here, comparing the blind cave and the surface morphotypes of Astyanax mexicanus fish, we found heterochronies during gastrulation that produce organizer and axial mesoderm tissues with different properties (including differences in the expression of dkk1b) that may have contributed to cavefish brain evolution. These variations observed during gastrulation depend fully on maternal factors. The developmental evolution of retinal morphogenesis and hypothalamic patterning are among those traits that retained significant maternal influence at larval stages. Transcriptomic analysis of fertilized eggs from both morphotypes and reciprocal F1 hybrids showed a strong and specific maternal signature. Our work strongly suggests that maternal effect genes and developmental heterochronies that occur during gastrulation have impacted morphological brain change during cavefish evolution.},

 abstract = {Phytoplasmas are linked to diseases in hundreds of economically important crops, including carrots. In carrots, phytoplasmosis is associated with leaf chlorosis and necrosis, coupled with inhibited root system development, ultimately leading to significant economic losses. During a field study conducted in Baden-Württemberg (Germany), two strains of the provisional taxon ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’ were identified within a carrot plot. For further analysis, strains M8 and M33 underwent shotgun sequencing, utilising single-molecule-real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing and sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) paired-end short-read sequencing techniques. Hybrid assemblies resulted in complete de novo assemblies of two genomes harboring circular chromosomes and two plasmids. Analyses, including average nucleotide identity and sequence comparisons of established marker genes, confirmed the phylogenetic divergence of ‘Ca. P. asteris’ and a different assignment of strains to the 16S rRNA subgroup I-A for M33 and I-B for M8. These groups exhibited unique features, encompassing virulence factors and genes, associated with the mobilome. In contrast, pan-genome analysis revealed a highly conserved gene set related to metabolism across these strains. This analysis of the Aster Yellows (AY) group reaffirms the perception of phytoplasmas as bacteria that have undergone extensive genome reduction during their co-evolution with the host and an increase of genome size by mobilome.},

A total of 30 C2/H30Rx and 33 C1-M27 ST131 isolates were selected for Illumina MiSeq sequencing and 30 isolates for MinION sequencing, followed by hybrid de novo assembly. Five C2/H30Rx and one C1-M27 cluster were identified. C1-M27 isolates harbored the F1:A2:B20 plasmid in 93.9\% of cases. Long-read sequencing revealed that blaCTX-M-27 was on plasmids. Among the C2/H30Rx isolates, only six isolates carried the C2-associated F2:A1:B- plasmid type. Of 19 hybrid-assembled C2/H30Rx genomes, the blaCTX-M-15 gene was located on plasmid only in one isolate, while in the other isolates, ISEcp1 or IS26-mediated chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M-15 was detected in unique variations. In one isolate a part of F2:A1:B- plasmid integrated into the chromosome. These results suggest that CTX-M-15-producing C2/H30Rx and CTX-M-27-producing C1-M27 subclades may have emerged and spread in different ways in Hungary. While blaCTX-M-27 was carried mainly on the C1/H30R-associated F1:A2:B20 plasmid, the IncF-like plasmids of C2/H30Rx or its composite transposons have been incorporated into the chromosome through convergent evolutionary processes.},

 abstract = {Sexual differentiation of inflorescences and flowers is important for reproduction and affects crop plant productivity. We report here on a molecular study of the process of sexual differentiation in the immature inflorescence of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). This species is monoecious and exhibits gender diphasy, producing male and female inflorescences separately on the same plant in alternation. Three main approaches were used: small RNA-seq to characterise and study the expression of miRNA genes; RNA-seq to monitor mRNA accumulation patterns; hormone quantification to assess the role of cytokinins and auxins in inflorescence differentiation. Our study allowed the characterisation of 30 previously unreported palm MIRNA genes. In differential gene and miRNA expression studies, we identified a number of key developmental genes and miRNA-mRNA target modules previously described in relation to their developmental regulatory role in the cereal panicle, notably the miR156/529/535-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) gene regulatory module. Gene enrichment analysis highlighted the importance of hormone-related genes, and this observation was corroborated by the detection of much higher levels of cytokinins in the female inflorescence. Our data illustrate the importance of branching regulation within the developmental window studied, during which the female inflorescence, unlike its male counterpart, produces flower clusters on new successive axes by sympodial growth.},

The interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the human host, the infection ranges from asymptomatic to lethal, and differences in the degree of disease severity are important examples.Methods In this retrospective study, 24 nasopharyngeal swabs from 21 out of 457 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were analysed by whole-genome sequencing. The principal selection criteria were the duration of infection and disease severity.Results Two co-occurring rare mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 M gene were detected in six samples. Three of these samples were collected from an immunocompromised patient with fatal outcome, two from an immunocompetent patient, and one from a patient with severe disease and fatal outcome, all with a prolonged course of infection.Conclusions Although this interesting finding was demonstrated in a small number of patients, the results increase the knowledge regarding the significance of mutations in the M gene of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of persistent infection and viral escape mechanisms.},

In this retrospective study, we examined the intra-host viral evolution in an immunocompromised patient with B-cell lymphoma, severe COVID-19, and a two-stage, long-lasting in-hospital period with lethal outcome. The whole-genome sequencing profile demonstrated a dynamic accumulation of new viral mutations in the entire viral genome, mainly in S1-RBD and Nsp12, against the background of antiviral treatment and convalescent plasma transfusion. Long range-PCR and nanopore sequencing of ACE2, TLR7, TLR8, TLR4, DDX58, and IFIH1 genes revealed single nucleotide substitutions in the ACE2, TLR4, DDX58, IFIH1, and TLR7 receptors, negatively affecting the disease course from the onset. Our results demonstrate that genetic variations in host innate immunity and impaired adaptive immunity facilitate the accumulation of viral mutations that overcome antiviral treatment and passive antibody transfer, affecting the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

The aim ofthis study was to assess the antifibrotic effects of anti-S100A4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in murine models of SScand in precision cut skin slices of patients with SSc.Methods.The effects of anti-S100A4 mAbs were evaluated in a bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis model and inTsk-1 mice with a therapeutic dosing regimen. In addition, the effects of anti-S100A4 mAbs on precision cut SSc skinslices were analyzed by RNA sequencing.Results.Inhibition of S100A4 was effective in the treatment of pre-established bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis andin regression of pre-establishedfibrosis with reduced dermal thickening, myofibroblast counts, and collagen accumu-lation. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated targeting of multiple profibrotic and proinflammatory processes relevantto the pathogenesis of SSc on targeted S100A4 inhibition in a bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis model. Moreover, tar-geted S100A4 inhibition also modulated inflammation- andfibrosis-relevant gene sets in precision cut SSc skin slicesin an ex vivo trial approach. Selected downstream targets of S100A4, such as AMP-activated protein kinase,calsequestrin-1, and phosphorylated STAT3, were validated on the protein level, and STAT3 inhibition was shown toprevent the profibrotic effects of S100A4 onfibroblasts in human skin.Conclusion.Inhibition of S100A4 confers dual targeting of inflammatory andfibrotic pathways in complementarymouse models offibrosis and in SSc skin.

 abstract = {RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of peripheral blood can be a valuable source of information for investigating the status and mechanism of diseases. However, blood contains 50–80\% unwanted hemoglobin (Hb) transcripts. Lexogen’s QuantSeq mRNA-Seq-Kit for Illumina RNA-Seq features a ‘Globin Block’ (GB) module that depletes Hb cDNAs during library preparation. Here, we aimed to assess GB’s effectiveness and checked for technical biases attributable to GB. Using whole blood total RNA samples of 91 healthy individuals, we sequenced 91 pairs of GB and non-blocked samples (noGB) on Illumina HiSeq2500 and 8 pairs of GB/noGB technical replicates on HiSeq4000. GB reduced the fraction of Hb transcripts from 43\% (s.d. 14\%) to 8.0\% (s.d. 4.3\%). From GB samples we detected 1,397 more expressed genes at approximately 11 million reads per RNA-isolate. Enrichment and differential expression analyses did not reveal significant differences for GB and noGB samples with respect to molecular function. In contrast to results from studies that have examined the performance of GB during RNA isolation, we were able to assign GB to corresponding noGB samples (from multiple sequencing runs on HiSeq2500) with at least 89.8\% accuracy from the complete correlation matrix of all GB/GB, noGB/noGB and GB/noGB pairs. However, the use of different sequencers (HiSeq2500 vs HiSeq4000) impaired assignment of technical replicates, whereas assignment of GB to corresponding noGB samples worked perfectly when sequencing on one lane on HiSeq4000. Lexogen’s GB RNA-Seq module is a valuable addition during mRNA-Seq library preparation which works even with low amounts of input total RNA (50 ng per sample). GB facilitated the detection of low abundant transcripts and yielded more non-hemoglobin reads, while preserving biological information. We observed that differences in sequencing run and platform have a far greater effect on technical variation than the use of GB.},

 abstract = {Parsley is a commonly cultivated Apiaceae species of culinary and medicinal importance. Parsley has several recognized health benefits and the species has been utilized in traditional medicine since ancient times. Although parsley is among the most commonly cultivated members of Apiaceae, no systematic genomic research has been conducted on parsley. In the present work, parsley genome was sequenced using the long-read HiFi (high fidelity) sequencing technology and a draft contig assembly of 1.57 Gb that represents 80.9\% of the estimated genome size was produced. The assembly was highly repeat-rich with a repetitive DNA content of 81\%. The assembly was phased into a primary and alternate assembly in order to minimize redundant contigs. Scaffolds were constructed with the primary assembly contigs, which were used for the identification of AMP (antimicrobial peptide) genes. Characteristic AMP domains and 3D structures were used to detect and verify antimicrobial peptides. As a result, 23 genes (PcAMP1-23) representing defensin, snakin, thionin, lipid transfer protein and vicilin-like AMP classes were identified. Bioinformatic analyses for the characterization of peptide physicochemical properties indicated that parsley AMPs are extracellular peptides, therefore, plausibly exert their antimicrobial effects through the most commonly described AMP action mechanism of membrane attack. AMPs are attracting increasing attention since they display their fast antimicrobial effects in small doses on both plant and animal pathogens with a significantly reduced risk of resistance development. Therefore, identification and characterization of AMPs is important for their incorporation into plant disease management protocols as well as medicinal research for the treatment of multi-drug resistant infections.},

Comparative transcriptome profiling provides insights into the molecular and physiological functions between species and tissues. Total RNA from young cladodes and developing fruits of O. ficus-indica, O. robusta and O. joconostle was purified and sequenced by Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends technology, an RNA-seq variant. A total of 8383, 7890, and 5300 transcripts and GC content of 40.1, 39.9 and 40.1\% were obtained for the de novo assembly of O. ficus-indica, O. robusta and O. joconostle, respectively. For annotations, about 22.2–23.7\% of transcripts had matches in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database. Moreover, the enriched 21 COG categories, 282 KEGG pathways and 2793 GO terms revealed that the transcriptomes obtained included functionally diverse genes in Opuntia. Differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between fruit and cladode resulted in the enrichment of 13 significant KEGG pathways and 80 GO terms, where some genes viz. FULL, CYP75B1, and CMB1 were upregulated in the fruits of the three species. Between species, the most enriched GOs fell into the category of “Cellular Components”, which would explain the morphological and physiological differences between the three species. Moreover, DETs comparisons between fruit types and between cladodes were also reported.

From the de novo assembly of A. angustifolia, a total of 358,170 transcripts with average length of 1117 bp, N50 of 858 bp, and GC mean content of 43.5\% were obtained. About 48.7\% of the transcripts had open reading frame (ORF). Hence, 63.4\% and 42.7\% of the ORFs were annotated using Blastp and Blastx against UniProtKB database, respectively, uncovering the presence of at least 29,273 genes in the A. angustifolia transcriptome. The six pairwise comparisons between plant tissues resulted in the identification of 123,181 differentially expressed transcripts (23,978 were upregulated and 79,203 were downregulated). Several carbohydrate metabolism pathways were significantly enriched from the comparisons between leaves and stems. Thus, genes regulated for the fructan, starch and sucrose biosynthesis were discussed. Furthermore, genes involved in cellulose synthesis were explored being the members of the cellulose synthase genes subfamily were highly expressed in young leaf, while the members of the cellulose synthase-like subfamily were preferentially expressed in mature leaf. Moreover, A. angustifolia transcriptome served for the identification of 30,766 SSR and 21,686 VNTR potential markers. Overall, the transcriptomic data generated in this study provide an invaluable resource to understand the biology of A. angustifolia, offering new insight to understand their physiology and adaptation.},

Although lymphatic cells are in continuous contact with mesenchymal cells during development and in adult tissues, the role of mesenchymal cells in lymphatic vasculature development remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that a subpopulation of mesenchymal cells expressing the transcription factor Osr1 are in close association with migrating LECs and established lymphatic vessels in mice. Lineage tracing experiments revealed that Osr1+ cells precede LEC arrival during lymphatic vasculature assembly in the back of the embryo. Using Osr1-deficient embryos and functional in vitro assays, we show that Osr1 acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner controlling proliferation and early migration of LECs to peripheral tissues. Thereby, mesenchymal Osr1+ cells control, in a bimodal manner, the production of extracellular matrix scaffold components and signal ligands crucial for lymphatic vessel formation.},

@article{valsecchi_rna_2021,
 abstract = {Confinement of the X chromosome to a territory for dosage compensation is a prime example of how subnuclear compartmentalization is used to regulate transcription at the megabase scale. In Drosophila melanogaster, two sex-specific non-coding RNAs (roX1 and roX2) are transcribed from the X chromosome. They associate with the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex1, which acetylates histone H4 lysine 16 and thereby induces an approximately twofold increase in expression of male X-linked genes2,3. Current models suggest that X-over-autosome specificity is achieved by the recognition of cis-regulatory DNA high-affinity sites (HAS) by the MSL2 subunit4,5. However, HAS motifs are also found on autosomes, indicating that additional factors must stabilize the association of the MSL complex with the X chromosome. Here we show that the low-complexity C-terminal domain (CTD) of MSL2 renders its recruitment to the X chromosome sensitive to roX non-coding RNAs. roX non-coding RNAs and the MSL2 CTD form a stably condensed state, and functional analyses in Drosophila and mammalian cells show that their interactions are crucial for dosage compensation in vivo. Replacing the CTD of mammalian MSL2 with that from Drosophila and expressing roX in cis is sufficient to nucleate ectopic dosage compensation in mammalian cells. Thus, the condensing nature of roX–MSL2CTD is the primary determinant for specific compartmentalization of the X chromosome in Drosophila.},

 abstract = {The epigenetic features of defined chromosomal domains condition their biochemical and functional properties. Therefore, there is considerable interest in studying the epigenetic marks present at relevant chromosomal loci. Telomeric regions, which include telomeres and subtelomeres, have been traditionally considered heterochromatic. However, whereas the heterochromatic nature of subtelomeres has been widely accepted, the epigenetic status of telomeres remains controversial. Here, we studied the epigenetic features of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) telomeres by analyzing multiple genome-wide ChIP-seq experiments. Our analyses revealed that Arabidopsis telomeres are not significantly enriched either in euchromatic marks like H3K4me2, H3K9ac, and H3K27me3 or in heterochromatic marks such as H3K27me1 and H3K9me2. Thus, telomeric regions in Arabidopsis have a bimodal chromatin organization with telomeres lacking significant levels of canonical euchromatic and heterochromatic marks followed by heterochromatic subtelomeres. Since heterochromatin is known to influence telomere function, the heterochromatic modifications present at Arabidopsis subtelomeres could play a relevant role in telomere biology.},

 abstract = {Ramazzottius is a widespread genus of tardigrades with extreme cryptobiotic capabilities. Thanks to its ability to survive desiccation and freezing, this genus is usually recorded from harsh habitats such as exposed mosses and lichens and rock pools. In the last years, research focused on both describing Ramazzottius diversity and revealing the molecular mechanisms behind their cryptobiotic capabilities. Despite the research efforts in these fields, much still remains to be discovered. Here we describe a new Ramazzottius species from an Italian rock pool by means of integrative taxonomy (morphology, morphometry, and DNA sequencing) and sequenced its genome with Nanopore technology to provide an assembled mitogenome and annotate its Temperature and Desiccation Resistance Proteins (TDPR) repertoire. The new gonochoric species is phylogenetically close to the parthenogenetic R. varieornatus, a strain of which (YOKOZUNA-1) has been adopted as model organism for the study of cryptobiosis. The mitogenome of the new species shows perfect synteny with R. varieornatus and shares with it most of the TDPR genes. The relative genetic similarity of the new species to the model R. varieornatus, combined with unique biological traits (for example the difference in reproductive mode and the unique habitat it colonizes), makes the new species a potential new addition to the range of model tardigrade species.},

The aim of this study was to: 1) gain insight into the gene regulatory networks modulating leaf responses to polluted air, 2) identify possible changes in the leaf microbiome due to particulate matter in the real urban environment. The leaf transcriptome and microbiome were analyzed for Photinia x fraseri L. plants cultivated for three months in pots in two close-by areas under different levels of air PMs (low and high). PCA and heat map analysis showed that 28 differentially expressed genes in common between the three pairwise comparisons were able to clearly discriminate plants under higher PM levels. The pollutants were mainly sensed by plants through a restructuring modification of cell wall and membrane due to the main repression of lipid desaturases. In addition, high PMs showed a clear repression of genes belonging to primary metabolism pathways involved in C assimilation. Microbiome analysis showed no significant changes in taxonomic diversity indexes for the bacterial communities, whereas fungi belonging to the genera Epicoccum and Dioszegia were differently affected by the different exposure to PM levels. A model of transcriptional regulation to air PMs in plants has been proposed.},

@article{videm_chira_2021,
 abstract = {With the advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, it is possible to determine RNA-RNA interaction and RNA structure predictions on a genome-wide level. The reads from these experiments usually are chimeric, with each arm generated from one of the interaction partners. Owing to short read lengths, often these sequenced arms ambiguously map to multiple locations. Thus, inferring the origin of these can be quite complicated. Here we present ChiRA, a generic framework for sensitive annotation of these chimeric reads, which in turn can be used to predict the sequenced hybrids.Grouping reference loci on the basis of aligned common reads and quantification improved the handling of the multi-mapped reads in contrast to common strategies such as the selection of the longest hit or a random choice among all hits. On benchmark data ChiRA improved the number of correct alignments to the reference up to 3-fold. It is shown that the genes that belong to the common read loci share the same protein families or similar pathways. In published data, ChiRA could detect 3 times more new interactions compared to existing approaches. In addition, ChiRAViz can be used to visualize and filter large chimeric datasets intuitively.ChiRA tool suite provides a complete analysis and visualization framework along with ready-to-use Galaxy workflows and tutorials for RNA-RNA interactome and structurome datasets. Common read loci built by ChiRA can rescue multi-mapped reads on paralogous genes without requiring any information on gene relations. We showed that ChiRA is sensitive in detecting new RNA-RNA interactions from published RNA-RNA interactome datasets.},

@article{vieira_polymyxin_2024,
 abstract = {Until 2015, polymyxin resistance was primarily attributed to chromosomal mutations. However, with the first report of mobile colistin resistance (mcr-1) in commensal Escherichia coli from food animals in China, the landscape has changed. To evaluate the presence of polymyxin resistance in Salmonella spp., a drop screening test for colistin and polymyxin B was carried out on 1156 isolates of non-human origin (animals, food, and the environment), received in Brazil, between 2016 and 2021. Subsequently, 210 isolates with resistant results in the drop test were subjected to the gold-standard test (broth microdilution) for both colistin and polymyxin B. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 102 resistant isolates was performed for a comprehensive analysis of associated genes. Surprisingly, none of the isolates resistant to colistin in the drop test harbored any of the mcr variants (mcr-1 to mcr-10). WGS identified that the most common mutations were found in pmrA (n= 22; T89S) and pmrB (n = 24; M15T, G73S, V74I, I83A, A111V). Other resistance determinants were also detected, such as the aac(6′)-Iaa gene in 72 isolates, while others carried beta-lactamase genes (blaTEM-1 blaCTX-M-2, blaCMY-2). Additionally, genes associated with fluoroquinolone resistance (qnrB19, qnrS1, oqxA/B) were detected in 11 isolates. Colistin and polymyxin B resistance were identified among Salmonella from non-human sources, but not associated with the mcr genes. Furthermore, the already-described mutations associated with polymyxin resistance were detected in only a small number of isolates, underscoring the need to explore and characterize unknown genes that contribute to resistance.},

 abstract = {Pervasive transcription originating from the ubiquitous activity of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) generates a vast mass of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that represent a potential harm to gene expression. In the compact genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the main genomewide safeguard against pervasive ncRNAs is the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, composed of two RNA-binding proteins (Nrd1 and Nab3) and the helicase Sen1. The NNS complex directs transcription termination of ncRNA genes and promotes the rapid degradation of pervasive transcripts from yeast nuclei through its physical and functional coupling to the nuclear RNA exosome. We have recently shown that inhibition of the exosome in yeast cells leads to the accumulation of ncRNAs complexed with Nab3 and Nrd1, decreasing recycling of these termination factors to sites of transcription and inducing global termination defects at NNS targets. Consistent with the notion that ncRNAs out-titrate Nab3 and Nrd1 termination factors, we have shown that a similar genomewide termination impairment could be achieved by expressing a circular RNA decoy containing a Nab3 binding target [1]. In relation to this previous research article, here we expand our observations on the effect of the circular RNA decoy on NNS termination. We aimed at verifying that the Nab3 binding sequence present on the decoy is indeed efficiently sequestering Nab3 as intended by design, leading to the expected decrease of Nab3 binding on NNS targets. We employed the crosslinking and cDNA analysis protocol (CRAC) on yeast cells expressing the circular ncRNA decoy or a control construct. We present data from high-resolution genomewide RNA binding of Nab3 in three independent biological replicates of these S.cerevisiae cells, normalized by spiked-in S.pombe lysates. These data allow the useful assessment of the extent of co-transcriptional binding decrease of Nab3 by decoy ncRNA titration and will be valuable for further analyses of NNS targeting mechanisms.},

How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance, and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation.},

Endophytes may contribute to the yield and composition of EOs, representing a useful tool for biotechnological applications. In this work, we investigated the genomic basis of this potential contribution. The annotated genomes of four endophytic strains isolated from Origanum vulgare L. were used to obtain KEGG ortholog codes, which were used for the annotation of different pathways in KEGG, and to evaluate whether endophytes might harbor the (complete) gene sets for terpene and/or plant hormone biosynthesis. All strains possessed ortholog genes for the mevalonate-independent pathway (MEP/DOXP), allowing for the production of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) precursors. Ortholog genes for the next steps in terpenoid biosynthesis were scarce. All the strains possess potential plant growth promotion (PGP) ability, as shown by the presence of orthologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of indoleacetic acid. The main contribution of endophytes to the yield and composition of O. vulgare EO very likely resides in their PGP activities and in the biosynthesis of precursors of bioactive compounds.},

 abstract = {In this thesis, comparative genomics was used to demonstrate that geographically-arranged, discrete terpenoid chemotypes in Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) are determined by a supergene comprising tightly clustered terpinene synthase (TPS) loci.  Supergenes are a set of linked genes that are inherited together as a single locus to affect a complex phenotype. They are generally thought to be adaptive and to associate with regions of suppressed recombination due to genome structural variations. The concept of a supergene has been around since the Modern Synthesis, in the early twentieth century, but many questions remain as to their evolutionary significance in adaptation and speciation, and how their genetic architecture and origins contribute to the geographic structure of complex phenotypes in natural populations. {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}Tea tree is an ideal model to study terpenoid genetics within the family of Myrtaceae due to the deep understanding of terpenoid biochemistry, genomic tools and population resources accumulated over the more than 30 years it has been used as a plantation crop for essential oil production in Australia. Tea tree has six recognised chemotypes that are defined by the foliar concentrations of the three key monoterpenoids terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole and terpinolene, but only the high terpinen-4-ol chemotype is grown commercially for its medicinal properties. Chemotypes in natural populations have a distinct geographic arrangement in upland and coastal regions. An adaptive role for chemotypes remains unclear, although recent studies showed a correlation of host preference by insects with terpenoid chemistry. The fundamental steps of terpenoid biosynthesis are well understood, and some TPS and other key enzymes have been identified and characterised in tea tree. Many plants encode a vast array of TPS, each catalysing the synthesis of one or more terpenoid constituents, with some species from the related genus Eucalyptus possessing the largest TPS gene families known in plants. Genome studies have shown that these TPS tend to be organised into gene clusters, due to an evolutionary process involving tandem duplication and subsequent functional specialisation. The resultant gene organisation makes TPS clusters prime candidates for supergene formation. {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}Long-read genome sequencing was carried out to provide a foundation for reliable gene discovery, and study of genomic organisation in tea tree. A draft genome of 362 Mb size was assembled that exceeded the quality (N50 = 1.9 Mb) of any previously available sequence for the taxon. A total of 58 putatively functional full-length TPS genes, and 21 pseudogenes were identified and manually annotated. As in other Myrtaceae, TPS genes tended to occur in tandem arrays. The largest cluster of 13 TPS was located within 400 kb on a single scaffold of 731 kb length. This cluster included four TPS that encoded a sabinene hydrate synthase, producing the precursor of terpinen-4-ol, one terpinolene synthase, and two 1,8-cineole synthases. The observation of a tight clustering of four structural genes, previously shown to influence the levels of the key monoterpenoids defining chemotypes in tea tree, satisfied the first part of the supergene concept. {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was then used to associate marker genotypes with terpenoid chemotypes in tea tree. A set of 148 geographically diverse individuals spanning the upland and coastal ecotypes, and all of the six known chemotypes, were selected for genotyping, and approximately 22,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The GWAS found SNPs significantly associated with variations in 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, and terpinolene concentrations. Large proportions of their variation were explained by five SNPs near the previously identified TPS cluster, with some individual SNPs explaining 19-30\% of phenotypic variance. Closer examination uncovered the presence of chemotype-dependent null alleles at a further three SNPs located within the TPS cluster, suggesting one or more structural variants in this region, which may contribute to reduced recombination, and thus provides a possible basis for the strong linkage disequilibrium observed on this scaffold. Confirmation of SNP allele associations with terpenoid phenotypes was found in a separate domesticated population subject to artificial selection for a single chemotype, where all SNP alleles surrounding the TPS cluster were fixed.  {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}These observations strongly suggest a supergene, where multiple physically proximal TPS genes behaving as a single linkage block account for the discrete chemotypes in tea tree. TPS supergenes are likely facilitated by tandem duplication and subsequent specialisation, leading to gene clusters with related functionality. Multiple adaptive alleles at neighbouring loci could then be captured as haplotypes, if structural variation arises that impedes recombination between TPS in this region. The shared biochemical origins of the terpenoid components and their interdependence are likely key to the concerted changes in discrete chemotypes and this mode of supergene evolution. Such supergenes, where relatively few alleles from several TPS loci are tied together in a limited number of haplotype blocks, may allow concerted, saltatory changes in complex terpenoid phenotypes in tea tree and other plants. This thesis argues that a genetic model with three haplotypes, encompassing the four characterised TPS genes, and invoking substrate competition for a common precursor, could account for all six chemotypes in M. alternifolia, and is consistent with the available bi-parental cross segregation data.},

 abstract = {Terpene synthases (TPS) are responsible for the terminal biosynthetic step of terpenoid production. They are encoded by a highly diverse gene family believed to evolve by tandem duplication in response to adaptive pressures. Taxa in the Myrtaceae family are renowned for their diversity of terpenoid-rich essential oils, and among them, the tribe Eucalypteae has the largest TPS gene family found in any plant ({\textgreater} 100 TPS). In this study, comparative analysis of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree), from the related tribe Melaleuceae, revealed some Myrtaceae have smaller TPS families, as a total of 58 putatively functional full-length TPS genes, and 21 pseudogenes were identified by manual annotation of a newly released long-read assembly of the genome. The TPS-a and TPS-b2 subfamilies that synthesise secondary compounds often mediating plant-environment interactions were more diminutive than those in eucalypts, probably reflecting key differences in the evolutionary histories of the two lineages. Of the putatively functional TPS-b1, 13 clustered into a region of around 400 kb on one scaffold. The organisation of these TPS suggested that tandem duplication was instrumental in the evolution and diversity of terpene chemistry in Melaleuca. Four TPS-b1 likely to catalyse the synthesis of the three monoterpenoid components that are used to classify tea tree chemotypes were encoded within a single small region of 87 kb in the larger cluster of TPS-b1, raising the possibility that coregulation and linkage may lead to their behaviour as a single locus, providing an explanation for the categorical inheritance of complex multiple-component chemotypes in the taxon.},

The study presents a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of the impact of ionising radiation (IR) on barley seedlings, intending to identify candidate pathways for creating radiation-resilient barley plants. We found that different IR treatments (gamma, electron, proton, neutron) increased the intensity of protein catabolism and led to the attenuation of translation. The impact of IRs on protein synthesis and degradation was accompanied by rearrangements in energy metabolism and reallocation of nitrogen, probably due to enhanced protein catabolism. At least partially, those changes seem to fuel secondary metabolites production, including riboflavin, various phytoalexins, phytosiderophores, ferulic and sinapic acids, kaempferol, quercetin, nictoflorin, gallate, and podophyllotoxin. Many of these compounds have antioxidant or radioprotective properties. To focus on possible targets for gene editing, we identified genes differentially regulated after all types of IR exposure and potential transcription factors regulating secondary metabolism, including AP2/ERF, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, MYB, and NAC families.},

Insulator-binding proteins (IBPs) play a critical role in genome architecture by forming and maintaining contact domains. While the involvement of several IBPs in organising chromatin architecture in
Drosophila
has been described, the specific contribution of the Suppressor of Hairy wings (Su(Hw)) IBP to genome topology remains unclear. In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of long-range interactions (LRIs) between Su(Hw) and Combgap ChIP-Seq peaks, reflected in the indirect binding of these proteins to chromatin in ChIP experiments. Loss of Su(Hw) binding results in the disappearance of Su(Hw)-Combgap LRIs and a decrease in spatial self-interactions among a subset of Su(Hw) sites. Our findings suggest that Su(Hw)-Combgap LRIs are associated with active chromatin rather than Polycomb-directed repression. Furthermore, we observe that the majority of transcription start sites that are down-regulated upon loss of Su(Hw) binding to chromatin are located within 2 kb of Combgap peaks and exhibit Su(Hw)-dependent changes in Combgap and transcriptional regulators’ binding.},

The present work evaluates for the first time, the impact of secondary pions on central nervous system functionality. The fractional pion dose emanating from thicker shielded spacecraft regions could contribute up to 10\% of the total absorbed radiation dose. New results from the Paul Scherrer Institute have revealed that low dose exposures to 150 MeV positive and negative pions, akin to a Mars mission, result in significant, long-lasting cognitive impairments.

To comprehend the origin, transmission routes and discover the mutations that alter the virus’s transmissibility and pathogenicity, full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes have to be molecularly characterized. Focusing on a two-year time frame (2020-2021), we provide an in-depth virologic and epidemiological overview of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Republic of North Macedonia by assessing the frequency and distribution of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis we shed light on the molecular evolution of the virus as well as test for a possible connection between specific SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes and the severity of the clinical symptoms. Our results show that one fifth (21.51\%) of the tested respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. A noticeable trend in the incidence and severity of the COVID-19 infections was observed in the 60+ age group between males and females. Of the total number of positive cases, the highest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was noticed in 60+ males (4,170.4/100,000), with a statistically significant (0,0001) difference between the two sexes. Additionally, a 1.8x increase in male mortality and consequentially significantly higher number of death cases was observed compared to females of the same age group (0.001). A total of 327 samples were sequenced in the period March 2020 - August 2021, showing the temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in North Macedonia. The phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the viral genomes were closely related and clustered in four distinctive lineages, B.1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2. A statistically significant difference was observed in the 2C\_1 haplotype (p=0.0013), where 10.5\% of the patients were hospitalized due to severe clinical condition. By employing genetic sequencing, coupled with epidemiological investigations, we investigated viral distribution patterns, identified emerging variants and detected vaccine breakthrough infections. The present work is the first molecular study giving a comprehensive overview of the genetic landscape of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses in North Macedonia in a period of two years.},

 abstract = {Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium found in the normal gut microbiota of diverse species, including vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as being common in the environment. It is also an opportunistic pathogen with a broad host range. One of the hosts E. faecalis can infect is the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila immune response is distinct from that of humans and interacts with E. faecalis differently. To study this interaction we carried out experimental evolution via serial passage of E. faecalis in Drosophila. We generated E. faecalis strains with much-enhanced ability to survive and proliferate within this host. Strains selected in this way are specifically resistant to the Toll-induced Bomanin family of effector peptides, resulting not only in higher E. faecalis numbers but also in a significant increase in pathogenicity. Many of these Drosophila-selected strains also exhibit marked increases or decreases in antimicrobial resistance. Whole genome sequencing showed that most selected strains carried single mutations and that many of these mutations were in genes encoding proteins known to be involved in bacterial surface characteristics and antimicrobial resistance (mprF\_2, liaF, yxdM, croS, bgsA). To test if Drosophila antimicrobial peptides kill E. faecalis using mechanisms similar to antibiotics we generated E. faecalis strains that were resistant to daptomycin. Some of these daptomycin-adapted strains also acquired resistance to the Drosophila immune response. Daptomycin-adapted E. faecalis strains have mutations in the same genes or the same regulatory systems as were observed in Drosophila-adapted strains. As common genetic mechanisms underlie the resistance of E. faecalis to daptomycin and the Drosophila immune response, these results indicate these two systems target the same conserved bacterial properties in E. faecalis. They also demonstrate that the selection and emergence of antibiotic resistance in vivo does not require antibiotic exposure.},

 abstract = {VEZF1 is a highly conserved vertebrate transcription factor that has ubiquitous expression in vertebrates. VEZF1 is essential for the barrier activity of the chicken ẞ globin HS4 insulator, where it prevents de novo DNA methylation. Knock-out of VEZF1 results in lethal haemorrhaging and edema in murine embryos, indicating a role for VEZF1 in the maintenance of vascular integrity.

In this study, the CUT\&Tag method, previously reported to be an improvement on CUT\&RUN and ChIP-seq, was utilised to map VEZF1 binding sites in K562 cells. The binding sites identified by CUT\&Tag are similar to those previously identified using ChIP-seq, but the data generated from CUT\&Tag shows significant advantages of lower background and higher peaks. Peak analysis indicates that most of the VEZF1 peaks are associated with promoters or enhancers, and there is strong co-localisation of the binding of VEZF1 and GATA2. VEZF1 tends to recognize and bind to GGGNGGGG motifs, but no difference is found between GGGNGGGG motifs discovered at VEZF1-associated promoters and enhancers. Furthermore, co-localisation of GATA2 does not affect the sequence of the GGGGNGGGG motifs enriched at VEZF1 peaks. Sequence analysis also revealed other motifs that are recognized by a variety of transcription factors, which may act alongside VEZF1 to regulate gene expression in K562 cells. 

Our study shows that CUT\&Tag is an efficient method for mapping and analyzing the binding sites of transcription factors, and provides new opportunities for research on the interactions between VEZF1 and other transcription factors.},

Advances in DNA-sequencing technologies have not only reduced the cost of sequencing but, with the advent of highly accurate long-read methods, have also enabled facile genome assembly even using mixed genomic input, thereby allowing us to more easily assess the contribution of symbionts to their insect hosts. In this study, genomic data recently generated from Peregrinus maidis was used to assemble the genome of a bacterial symbiont, Pm Arsenophonus sp. This {\textasciitilde}4.9-Mb assembly is one of the largest Arsenophonus genomes reported to date. The Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) result indicates that this Pm Arsenophonus assembly has a high degree of completeness, with 96\% of the single-copy Enterobacterales orthologs found. The identity of the Pm Arsenophonus sp. was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicates a major contribution by Pm Arsenophonus sp. to the biosynthesis of B vitamins and essential amino acids in P. maidis, where threonine and lysine production is carried out solely by Pm Arsenophonus sp. This study not only provides deeper insights into the evolutionary relationships between symbionts and their insect hosts, but also adds to our understanding of insect biology, potentially guiding the development of novel pest control methods.},

 abstract = {The regulation of plant biomass degradation by fungi is critical to the carbon cycle, and applications in bioproducts and biocontrol. Trichoderma harzianum is an important plant biomass degrader, enzyme producer, and biocontrol agent, but few putative major transcriptional regulators have been deleted in this species. The T. harzianum ortholog of the transcriptional activator XYR1/XlnR/XLR-1 was deleted, and the mutant strains were analyzed through growth profiling, enzymatic activities, and transcriptomics on cellulose. From plate cultures, the Δxyr1 mutant had reduced growth on D-xylose, xylan, and cellulose, and from shake-flask cultures with cellulose, the Δxyr1 mutant had {\textasciitilde}90\% lower β-glucosidase activity, and no detectable β-xylosidase or cellulase activity. The comparison of the transcriptomes from 18 h shake-flask cultures on D-fructose, without a carbon source, and cellulose, showed major effects of XYR1 deletion whereby the Δxyr1 mutant on cellulose was transcriptionally most similar to the cultures without a carbon source. The cellulose induced 43 plant biomass-degrading CAZymes including xylanases as well as cellulases, and most of these had massively lower expression in the Δxyr1 mutant. The expression of a subset of carbon catabolic enzymes, other transcription factors, and sugar transporters was also lower in the Δxyr1 mutant on cellulose. In summary, T. harzianum XYR1 is the master regulator of cellulases and xylanases, as well as regulating carbon catabolic enzymes.},

@article{wang_systems-level_2023,
 abstract = {Chemical modifications of transcripts with a 5′ cap occur in all organisms and function in many aspects of RNA metabolism. To facilitate analysis of RNA caps, we developed a systems-level mass spectrometry-based technique, CapQuant, for accurate and sensitive quantification of the cap epitranscriptome. The protocol includes the addition of stable isotope-labeled cap nucleotides (CNs) to RNA, enzymatic hydrolysis of endogenous RNA to release CNs, and off-line enrichment of CNs by ion-pairing high-pressure liquid chromatography, followed by a 17 min chromatography-coupled tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry run for the identification and quantification of individual CNs. The total time required for the protocol can be up to 7 d. In this approach, 26 CNs can be quantified in eukaryotic poly(A)-tailed RNA, bacterial total RNA and viral RNA. This protocol can be modified to analyze other types of RNA and RNA from in vitro sources. CapQuant stands out from other methods in terms of superior specificity, sensitivity and accuracy, and it is not limited to individual caps nor does it require radiolabeling. Thanks to its unique capability of accurately and sensitively quantifying RNA caps on a systems level, CapQuant can reveal both the RNA cap landscape and the transcription start site distribution of capped RNA in a broad range of settings.},

 abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a rapidly advancing field enabling the characterisation of heterogeneous gene expression profiles within a population. The cell cycle phase is a major contributor to gene expression variance between cells and computational analysis tools have been developed to assign cell cycle phases to cells within scRNAseq datasets. Whilst these tools can be extremely useful, all have the drawback that they classify cells as only G1, S or G2/M. Existing discrete cell phase assignment tools are unable to differentiate between G2 and M and continuous-phase-assignment tools are unable to identify a region corresponding specifically to mitosis in a pseudo-timeline for continuous assignment along the cell cycle. In this study, bulk RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes between mitotic and interphase cells isolated based on phospho-histone H3 expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These gene lists were used to develop a methodology which can distinguish G2 and M phase cells in scRNAseq datasets. The phase assignment tools present in Seurat were modified to allow for cell cycle phase assignment of all stages of the cell cycle to identify a mitotic-specific cell population.},

@article{weber_histone_2023,
 abstract = {The lysine acetyltransferase KAT6A (MOZ, MYST3) belongs to the MYST family of chromatin regulators, facilitating histone acetylation. Dysregulation of KAT6A has been implicated in developmental syndromes and the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous work suggests that KAT6A is recruited to its genomic targets by a combinatorial function of histone binding PHD fingers, transcription factors and chromatin binding interaction partners. Here, we demonstrate that a winged helix (WH) domain at the very N-terminus of KAT6A specifically interacts with unmethylated CpG motifs. This DNA binding function leads to the association of KAT6A with unmethylated CpG islands (CGIs) genome-wide. Mutation of the essential amino acids for DNA binding completely abrogates the enrichment of KAT6A at CGIs. In contrast, deletion of a second WH domain or the histone tail binding PHD fingers only subtly influences the binding of KAT6A to CGIs. Overexpression of a KAT6A WH1 mutant has a dominant negative effect on H3K9 histone acetylation, which is comparable to the effects upon overexpression of a KAT6A HAT domain mutant. Taken together, our work revealed a previously unrecognized chromatin recruitment mechanism of KAT6A, offering a new perspective on the role of KAT6A in gene regulation and human diseases.},

@article{weise_foxg1_2018,
 abstract = {Rett syndrome is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is mainly caused by mutations in MECP2. However, mutations in FOXG1 cause a less frequent form of atypical Rett syndrome, called FOXG1 syndrome. FOXG1 is a key transcription factor crucial for forebrain development, where it maintains the balance between progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Using genome-wide small RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics, we identified that FOXG1 affects the biogenesis of miR200b/a/429 and interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, DDX5/p68. Both FOXG1 and DDX5 associate with the microprocessor complex, whereby DDX5 recruits FOXG1 to DROSHA. RNA-Seq analyses of Foxg1cre/+ hippocampi and N2a cells overexpressing miR200 family members identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR2B) as a target of miR200 in neural cells. PRKAR2B inhibits postsynaptic functions by attenuating protein kinase A (PKA) activity; thus, increased PRKAR2B levels may contribute to neuronal dysfunctions in FOXG1 syndrome. Our data suggest that FOXG1 regulates PRKAR2B expression both on transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.},

 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies worldwide with an urgent need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. One major risk factor for PDAC is the pre-indication of chronic pancreatitis (CP), which represents highly inflammatory pancreatic tissue. Kallikreins (KLKs) are secreted serine proteases that play an important role in various cancers as components of the tumor microenvironment. Previous studies of KLKs in solid tumors largely relied on either transcriptomics or immunodetection. We present one of the first targeted mass spectrometry profiling of kallikrein proteases in PDAC, CP, and normal pancreas. We show that KLK6 and KLK10 are significantly upregulated in PDAC (n=14) but not in CP (n=7) when compared to normal pancreas (n=16), highlighting their specific intertwining with malignancy. Additional explorative proteome profiling identified 5936 proteins in our pancreatic cohort and observed disease-specific proteome rearrangements in PDAC and CP. As such, PDAC features an enriched proteome motif for extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion while there is depletion of mitochondrial energy metabolism proteins, reminiscent of the Warburg effect. Although often regarded as a PDAC hallmark, the ECM fingerprint was also observed in CP, alongside with a prototypical inflammatory proteome motif as well as with an increased wound healing process and proteolytic activity, thereby possibly illustrating tissue autolysis. Proteogenomic analysis based on publicly accessible data sources identified 112 PDAC-specific and 32 CP-specific single amino acid variants, which among others affect KRAS and ANKHD1. Our study emphasizes the diagnostic potential of kallikreins and provides novel insights into proteomic characteristics of PDAC and CP.},

In this study, we assessed the duration of rectal ESBL- producing E. coli colonisation in the residents, and compare duration of colonisation for ESBL-ST131 versus ESBL-non-ST131.MethodsRectal or faecal samples were obtained from residents of nursing home A between 2013 and 2019 and nursing home B between 2017 and 2019, with repeated point prevalence surveys at intervals of three to six months. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of E. coli were identified on selective culture and selective\&amp;nbsp;enrichment\&amp;nbsp;broth, and examined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In nursing home A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and cluster analyse was performed by respectively O25:ST131-specific PCR and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). In nursing home B whole genome sequencing data were used to determine MLST and to perform a cluster analyse. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed to calculate the median time of rectal colonisation of ESBL-EC with a Log-Rank analysis to test for differences between ESBL-ST131 and ESBL-non-ST131.ResultsA total of 144 residents were included: 84 residents (58\%) with ESBL-ST131 rectal colonisation and 60 residents (42\%) with ESBL-non-ST131 rectal colonisation. Survival analysis showed a median colonisation length of 13 months for ESBL-ST131 (95\%CI: 7,2 – 18,7) versus 8,3 months (95\%CI: 2,8 – 13,8) for ESBL-non-ST131 (p = 0,028). Remarkably, in the subgroup ST131 the median colonisation length was significantly longer in female than in males: 25,7 months versus 8,1 months (p = 0,013).ConclusionHere we found a prolonged colonisation duration of ESBL-ST131 compared to ESBL-non-ST131 in residents of Dutch nursing homes. Prolonged colonisation duration complicates the controlling and ending an ESBL-ST131 outbreak, especially in long stay settings such as nursing homes.\&amp;nbsp;},

Broader adoption of eDNA analysis will produce many well-recognized benefits for pathogen surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, endangered and invasive species detection, and population genetics. Here we show that deep-sequencing-based eDNA approaches capture genomic information from humans (Homo sapiens) just as readily as that from the intended target species. We term this phenomenon human genetic bycatch (HGB). Additionally, high-quality human eDNA could be intentionally recovered from environmental substrates (water, sand and air), holding promise for beneficial medical, forensic and environmental applications. However, this also raises ethical dilemmas, from consent, privacy and surveillance to data ownership, requiring further consideration and potentially novel regulation. We present evidence that human eDNA is readily detectable from ‘wildlife’ environmental samples as human genetic bycatch, demonstrate that identifiable human DNA can be intentionally recovered from human-focused environmental sampling and discuss the translational and ethical implications of such findings.},

 abstract = {Rafflesiaceae is a family of endangered plants whose members are solely parasitic to the tropical grape vine Tetrastigma (Vitaceae). Currently, the genetics of their crosstalk with the host remains unexplored. In this study, we use homology-based in silico approaches to characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs) expressed by Sapria himalayana and Rafflesia cantleyi from published omics data. Derived from secondary structures or hairpins, miRNAs are small regulators of gene expression. We found that some plant-conserved miRNA still exists in Rafflesiaceae. Out of 9 highly conserved miRNA families in plants, 7 families (156/157, 159/319, 160, 165/166, 171, 172, 390) were identified with a total of 22 variants across Rafflesiaceae. Some miRNAs were missing endogenous targets and may have evolved to target host miRNA, though this requires experimental verification. Rafflesiaceae miRNA promoters are mostly inducible by ethylene that mediates stress response in the host but could be perceived by the parasites as a signal for growth. This study provides evidence that certain miRNAs with ancient origins in land plants still exist in Rafflesiaceae, though some may have been coopted by parasites to target host genes.},

H3K18ac, H4K8ac and total lysine acetylation are increased in the outer rim of the disc. This acetylation pattern is controlled by nuclear position, whereby nuclei continuously move from apical to basal locations within the epithelium and exhibit high levels of H3K18ac when they are in proximity to the tissue surface. These surface nuclei have increased levels of acetyl-CoA synthase, which generates the acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation. The carbon source for histone acetylation in the rim is fatty acid β-oxidation, which is also increased in the rim. Inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation causes H3K18ac levels to decrease in the genomic proximity of genes involved in disc development. In summary, there is a physical mark of the outer rim of the wing and other imaginal epithelia in Drosophila that affects gene expression.},

@article{winkler_contrast_2020,
 abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables the unbiased characterization of surfaces with respect to their chemical composition. In biological MSI, zones with differentialmass profiles hint towards localized physiological processes, such as the tissue-specific accumulation of secondary metabolites, or diseases, such as cancer. Thus, the efficientdiscovery of ‘regions of interest’ (ROI) is of utmost importance in MSI. However, often the discovery of ROIs is hampered by high background noise and artifact signals. Especially in ambient ionization MSI, unmasking biologically relevant information from crude data sets is challenging. Therefore, we implemented a Threshold Intensity Quantization (TrIQ) algorithm for augmenting the contrast in MSI data visualizations. The simple algorithm reduces the impact of extreme values (‘outliers’) and rescales the dynamic range of mass signals. We provide an R script for post-processing MSI data in the imzML community format (https://bitbucket.org/lababi/msi.r) and implemented the TrIQ in our open-source imaging software RmsiGUI (https://bitbucket.org/lababi/rmsigui/). Applying these programs to different biological MSI data sets demonstrated the universal applicability of TrIQ for improving the contrast in the MSI data visualization. We show that TrIQ improves a subsequent detection of ROIs by sectioning. In addition, the adjustment of the dynamic signal intensity range makes MSI data sets comparable.},

Identification of the core microbiome by metagenome analysis and prediction of functional characteristics are essential to make microalgal feedstock more sustainable and economically feasible. Biogas production from photoautotrophically grown Chlorella vulgaris (Ch. vulgaris) biomass (240 mL CH4 g oTS-1) and co-fermentation with maize silage (330 mL CH4 g oTS-1) has been studied in semi continuous laboratory biogas fermenters. Maize silage control yielded 310 mL CH4 g oTS-1. The microbial community and the read-based functional profiles, derived from these data, were examined during the process by using next-generation metagenome Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The read-based core microbiome consisted of 92 genera from which 60 abundant taxa were directly associated with the microbial methane producing food chain. The data-set was also analyzed in a genome-based approach. 65 bins were assembled, 52 of them belonged in the core biogas producing genera identified by the read-based metagenomes. The read-based and genome-based approaches complemented and verified each other. The functional profiles indicated a variety of glycoside hydrolases. Substantial rearrangements of the methanogen functions have also been observed. Co-fermentation of algal biomass and plant biomass can be carried out for an extended period of time without process failure. The microbial members of the inoculum are well conserved, feedstock composition cause relative abundance changes in the core microbiome.},

The use of liquid wastes as nutrient clearly improves the sustainability of microalgal biofuel production. Microalgae and bacteria have an ecological inter-kingdom relationship. This microenvironment called phycosphere has a major role in the ecosystem productivity and can be utilized both in bioremediation and biomass production. However, knowledge on the effects of indigenous bacteria on microalgal growth and the characteristics of bacterial communities associated with microalgae are limited. In this study municipal, industrial and agricultural liquid waste derivatives were used as cultivation media. Chlorella vulgaris green microalgae and its bacterial partners efficiently metabolized the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content available in these wastes. The read-based metagenomics approach revealed a diverse microbial composition at the start point of cultivations in the different types of liquid wastes. The relative abundance of the observed taxa significantly changed over the cultivation period. The genome-centric reconstruction of phycospheric bacteria further explained the observed correlations between the taxonomic composition and biomass yield of the various waste-based biodegradation systems. Functional profile investigation of the reconstructed microbes revealed a variety of relevant biological processes like organic acid oxidation and vitamin B synthesis. Thus, liquid wastes were shown to serve as valuable resources of nutrients as well as of growth promoting bacteria enabling increased microalgal biomass production.},

 abstract = {IntroductionChronic heart failure is associated with adverse remodeling of the heart that is typically characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This requires the formation of new capillaries to maintain oxygen supply. Insufficient angiogenesis promotes the transition from compensated hypertrophy into heart failure. The aim of the present study was to identify angiogenesis-related gene networks and corresponding regulatory hubs in endothelial cells from failing human hearts.Methods and resultsWe isolated left ventricular endothelial cells from patients with advanced heart failure undergoing left ventricular assist device surgery (n = 15) and healthy organ donors (n = 2) and performed RNA sequencing. Subgroup analysis revealed no impact of co-morbidities on gene expression. In a weighted coexpression network analysis, we found 26 gene clusters, of which nine clusters showed a significant positive or negative correlation with the presence of heart failure. We identified the transcription factors CASZ1 (castor zinc finger 1), ZNF523 (zinc finger protein 523), and NFE2L1 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1) as hub genes of a cluster related to angiogenesis. Knock-down of CASZ1, ZNF523, or NFE2L1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells led to a downregulation of genes from the respective cluster, including CD34 and platelet derived growth factor β, confirming their regulatory function.ConclusionIn conclusion, we assessed gene networks in endothelial cells and identified transcription factors CASZ1, ZNF532, and NFE2L1 as potential regulators of angiogenesis in failing human hearts. Our study provides insights into the transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis beyond the classical vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway.},

 abstract = {The malaria parasite replicates asexually in the red blood cells of its vertebrate host employing epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression in response to changes in its environment. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing in conjunction with RNA sequencing to create an epigenomic and transcriptomic map of the developmental transition from asexual blood stages to male and female gametocytes and to ookinetes in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Across the developmental stages examined, heterochromatin protein 1 associates with variantly expressed gene families localised at subtelomeric regions and variant gene expression based on heterochromatic silencing is observed only in some genes. Conversely, the euchromatin mark histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) is abundant in non-heterochromatic regions across all developmental stages. H3K9ac presents a distinct pattern of enrichment around the start codon of ribosomal protein genes in all stages but male gametocytes. Additionally, H3K9ac occupancy positively correlates with transcript abundance in all stages but female gametocytes suggesting that transcription in this stage is independent of H3K9ac levels. This finding together with known mRNA repression in female gametocytes suggests a multilayered mechanism operating in female gametocytes in preparation for fertilization and zygote development, coinciding with parasite transition from host to vector.},

 abstract = {Microglia are the tissue-resident macrophages of the retina and brain, being critically involved in organ development, tissue homeostasis, and response to cellular damage. Until now, little is known about the molecular signature of human retinal microglia and how it differs from the one of brain microglia and peripheral monocytes. In addition, it is not yet clear to what extent murine retinal microglia resemble those of humans, which represents an important prerequisite for translational research. The present study applies fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate human retinal microglia from enucleated eyes and compares their transcriptional profile with the one of whole retinal tissue, human brain microglia as well as classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Finally, human retinal microglia are compared to murine retinal microglia, isolated from Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice. Whereas human retinal microglia exhibited a high grade of similarity in comparison to their counterparts in the brain, several enriched genes were identified in retinal microglia when compared to whole retinal tissue, as well as classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes. In relation to whole retina sequencing, several risk genes associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) were preferentially expressed in retinal microglia, indicating their potential pathophysiological involvement. Although a high degree of similarity was observed between human and murine retinal microglia, several species-specific genes were identified, which should be kept in mind when employing mouse models to investigate retinal microglia biology. In summary, this study provides detailed insights into the molecular profile of human retinal microglia, identifies a plethora of tissue-specific and species-specific genes in comparison to human brain microglia and murine retinal microglia, and thus highlights the significance of retinal microglia in human retinal diseases and for translational research approaches.},

@article{wolf_corneal_2020,
 abstract = {Purpose
Immune reactions following corneal transplantation are the most common cause of transplant failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of corneal graft rejection are not yet fully understood but increasing evidence points to a crucial role of the innate immune system in this context. Using a human in vitro model, we aimed to assess the response of human macrophages to stimulation with human corneal tissue and whether corneal endothelial cells (CEC) have immune-modulating properties.
Methods
Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). A standardized protocol was used for disaggregation of human corneas into fragments of defined sizes. MDMs were stimulated using processed corneal material with or without CEC. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-gamma (IFNγ) served as controls. RNA sequencing was applied to analyze the impact of differential stimulation of MDMs on their transcriptional profile. RNA sequencing results were validated using digital PCR.
Results
The transcriptional profile of MDMs was significantly modulated by the type of stimulus used for MDM activation as well as by the individual MDM donor. LPS- or IFNγ-stimulation resulted in distinct transcriptional alterations compared to unstimulated MDMs including an upregulation of various cytokines such as CCL3, 4, 5, 19 or CXCL9. Corneal tissue induced the differential expression of 45 genes when compared to unstimulated MDMs, with several metallothioneins (MTs) among the upregulated factors (MT1A, MT1E, MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, MT1L, MT1M, MT1X, MT2A). This effect was independent of the presence or absence of CEC. PCR validation confirmed induction of 3 different metallothioneins (MT1G, MT1H and MT2A) in MDMs stimulated by corneal tissue.
Conclusions
The MDM in vitro model proved to be a robust tool to study the effects of LPS, IFNγ and corneal tissue homogenates on the transcriptional activity of MDM. Human macrophages showed a distinct upregulation of various MTs when challenged with human corneal allogen with or without corneal endothelium, which might have an immune-modulatory effect. As a general observation, it appears that in MDM-based studies a significant donor-dependent effect on the transcriptional profile of MDMs needs to be considered and adjusted before downstream analysis.},

 abstract = {Hyalocytes are the tissue-resident innate immune cell population of the vitreous body with important functions in health and vitreoretinal disease. The purpose of this study is to gain new insights into the biology and function of human hyalocytes in comparison to other innate immune cells.    The present study applies fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptional profiles of human hyalocytes, retinal microglia (rMG) and classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes isolated from the same patients. Immunohistochemistry was applied for morphological characterization of human hyalocytes.    Pairwise analysis indicates distinct differences between hyalocytes and monocytes, whereas a high degree of similarity to rMG is apparent, with comparable expression levels of established microglia markers, such as TREM2, P2RY12, and TMEM119. Among the top expressed genes in hyalocytes, SPP1, CD74, and C3, were significantly upregulated when compared with monocytes. Despite the high level of similarity of hyalocytes and rMG, ten highly expressed genes in hyalocytes compared to microglia were identified, among them FOS, DUSP1, and EGR2.    This study reveals a high degree of similarity between hyalocytes and retinal microglia. Nevertheless, hyalocytes exhibit some expression differences that may adapt them to the specific needs of the vitreous and provide the basis for deciphering the multiple roles of this fascinating cell population in health and vitreoretinal diseases.},

Eight healthy conjunctival specimens served as controls. The TME of CM, as determined by bioinformatic cell type enrichment analysis, was characterized by the enrichment of melanocytes, pericytes and especially various immune cell types, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, B cells and mast cells. Differentially expressed genes between CM and control were mainly involved in inhibition of apoptosis, proteolysis and response to growth factors. POU3F3, BIRC5 and 7 were among the top expressed genes associated with inhibition of apoptosis. 20 genes, among them CENPK, INHA, USP33, CASP3, SNORA73B, AAR2, SNRNP48 and GPN1, were identified as prognostically relevant factors reaching high classification accuracy (area under the curve: 1.0). The present study provides new insights into the TME and the transcriptional profile of CM and additionally identifies new prognostic biomarkers. These results add new diagnostic tools and may lead to new options of targeted therapy for CM.},

Ten formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded conjunctival EMZL and eight healthy conjunctival specimens were analyzed by Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. The 3417 upregulated genes in conjunctival EMZL were involved in processes such as B cell proliferation and Rac protein signaling, whereas the 1188 downregulated genes contributed most significantly to oxidative phosphorylation and UV protection. The tumor microenvironment, as determined by deconvolution analysis, was mainly composed of multiple B cell subtypes which reflects the tumor’s B cell lineage. However, several T cell types, including T helper 2 cells and regulatory T cells, as well as innate immune cell types, such as anti-inflammatory macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, were also strongly enriched in conjunctival EMZL. A 13-biomarker prognostic panel, including S100A8 and S100A9, classified ocular and extraocular tumor recurrence, exceeded prognostic accuracy of Ann Arbor and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging, and demonstrated prognostic value for patient survival in 21 different cancer types in a database of 12,332 tumor patients. These findings may lead to new options of targeted therapy and may improve prognostic prediction for conjunctival EMZL.},

Worldwide research efforts have identified numerous ncRNAs and multiple RNA subtypes, which are attributed to diverse functionalities known to interact with different functional layers, from DNA and RNA to proteins. This makes the prediction of functions for newly identified ncRNAs challenging. Current bioinformatics and systems biology approaches show promising results to facilitate an identification of these diverse ncRNA functionalities. Here, we review (a) current experimental protocols, i.e., for Next Generation Sequencing, for a successful identification of ncRNAs; (b) sequencing data analysis workflows as well as available computational environments; and (c) state-of-the-art approaches to functionally characterize ncRNAs, e.g., by means of transcriptome-wide association studies, molecular network analyses, or artificial intelligence guided prediction. In addition, we present a strategy to cover the identification and functional characterization of unknown transcripts by using connective workflows.},

Implementation of such methods into routine diagnostic of highly dangerous pathogens, like Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Ebola virus, MERS, Lassa virus etc. would be very helpful. The best diagnostic strategy would be the metagenomic sequencing directly from the clinical sample. Implementation of majority of currently available WGS platforms inside the BSL-3 or 4 laboratory is impractical because of the size of the equipment and time consuming wet lab part (e.g. library preparation).

 abstract = {In the present study, we characterise a strain isolated from the wastewater aeration lagoon of a sugar processing plant in Schleswig (Northern Germany) by Heinz Schlesner. As a pioneer in planctomycetal research, he isolated numerous strains belonging to the phylum Planctomycetota from aquatic habitats around the world. Phylogenetic analyses show that strain SH412T belongs to the family Planctomycetaceae and shares with 91.6\% the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Planctopirus limnophila DSM 3776T. Its genome has a length of 7.3 Mb and a G + C content of 63.6\%. Optimal growth of strain SH412T occurs at pH 7.0–7.5 and 28 °C with its pigmentation depending on sunlight exposure. Strain SH412T reproduces by polar asymmetric division (“budding”) and forms ovoid cells. The cell size determination was performed using a semi-automatic pipeline, which we first evaluated with the model species P. limnophila and then applied to strain SH412T. Furthermore, the data acquired during time-lapse analyses suggests a lifestyle switch from flagellated daughter cells to non-flagellated mother cells in the subsequent cycle. Based on our data, we suggest that strain SH412T represents a novel species within a novel genus, for which we propose the name Planctoellipticum variicoloris gen. nov., sp. nov., with strain SH412T (= CECT 30430T = STH00996T, the STH number refers to the Jena Microbial Resource Collection JMRC) as the type strain of the new species.},

 abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important uropathogen that increasingly harbors broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance determinants. Evidence suggests that some same-strain recurrences in women with frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) may emanate from a persistent intravesicular reservoir. Our objective was to analyze K. pneumoniae isolates collected over weeks from multiple body sites of a single patient with recurrent UTI in order to track ordered strain progression across body sites, as has been employed across patients in outbreak settings. Whole-genome sequencing of 26 K. pneumoniae isolates was performed utilizing the Illumina platform. PacBio sequencing was used to create a refined reference genome of the original urinary isolate (TOP52). Sequence variation was evaluated by comparing the 26 isolate sequences to the reference genome sequence. Whole-genome sequencing of the K. pneumoniae isolates from six different body sites of this patient with recurrent UTI demonstrated 100\% chromosomal sequence identity of the isolates, with only a small P2 plasmid deletion in a minority of isolates. No single nucleotide variants were detected. The complete absence of single-nucleotide variants from 26 K. pneumoniae isolates from multiple body sites collected over weeks from a patient with recurrent UTI suggests that, unlike in an outbreak situation with strains collected from numerous patients, other methods are necessary to discern strain progression within a single host over a relatively short time frame.},

Indirect disruption of the electron transport chain by gene editing of SLC25A mitochondrial membrane transporters as well as direct genetic and pharmacological disruption of either complexes I, III, or the copper-containing complex IV of the electron transport chain elicited upregulation of APOE transcript, protein, and secretion, up to 49-fold. These APOE phenotypes were robustly expressed in diverse cell types and iPSC-derived human astrocytes as part of an inflammatory gene expression program. Moreover, age- and genotype-dependent decline in brain levels of respiratory complex I preceded an increase in APOE in the 5xFAD mouse model. We propose that mitochondria act as novel upstream regulators of APOE-dependent cellular processes in health and disease.},

@article{yan_diet-like_2023,
 abstract = {Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) has been demonstrated to be an efficient type of mutualism in methanogenesis. However, few studies have reported its presence in mixed microbial communities and its trigger mechanism in the natural environment and engineered systems. Here, we reported DIET-like mutualism of Geobacter and methanogens in the planktonic microbiome for the first time in anaerobic electrochemical digestion (AED) fed with propionate, potentially triggered by excessive cathodic hydrogen (56 times higher than the lowest) under the electrochemical condition. In contrast with model prediction without DIET, the highest current density and hydrogen and methane production were concurrently observed at −0.2 V where an abundance of Geobacter (49\%) and extracellular electron transfer genes were identified in the planktonic microbiome via metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic assembly genomes annotated to Geobacter anodireducens were identified alongside two methanogens, Methanothrix harundinacea and Methanosarcina mazei, which were previously identified to participate in DIET. This discovery revealed that DIET-like mutualism could be triggered without external conductive materials, highlighting its potentially ubiquitous presence. Such mutualism simultaneously boosted methane and hydrogen production, thereby demonstrating the potential of AED in engineering applications.},

@article{yanta_cryptogenotyper_2021,
 abstract = {Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that is transmitted to both humans and animals through zoonotic or anthroponotic means. When a host is infected with this parasite, it causes a gastrointestinal disease known as cryptosporidiosis. To understand the transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium, the small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA and gp60 genes are commonly studied through PCR analysis and conventional Sanger sequencing. However, analyzing sequence chromatograms manually is both time consuming and prone to human error, especially in the presence of poorly resolved, heterozygous peaks and the absence of a validated database. For this study, we developed a Cryptosporidium genotyping tool, called CryptoGenotyper, which has the capability to read raw Sanger sequencing data for the two common Cryptosporidium gene targets (SSU rRNA and gp60) and classify the sequence data into standard nomenclature. The CryptoGenotyper has the capacity to perform quality control and properly classify sequences using a high quality, manually curated reference database, saving users' time and removing bias during data analysis. The incorporated heterozygous base calling algorithms for the SSU rRNA gene target resolves double peaks, therefore recovering data previously classified as inconclusive. The CryptoGenotyper successfully genotyped 99.3\% (428/431) and 95.1\% (154/162) of SSU rRNA chromatograms containing single and mixed sequences, respectively, and correctly subtyped 95.6\% (947/991) of gp60 chromatograms without manual intervention. This new, user-friendly tool can provide both fast and reproducible analyses of Sanger sequencing data for the two most common Cryptosporidium gene targets.},

 abstract = {The biodegradation of lignite (brown coal) by microorganisms has the potential for bioremediation of contaminated mining sites and to generate alternative ways to valorize lignite, such as by producing humic acids or building block chemicals. Previously, a lignite-degrading strain of Trichoderma was isolated, but the genomic and transcriptomic basis of its lignite-degrading ability remained unknown. Here we report that the sequenced genome of the T. cf. simile WF8 strain encoded for enzymes with roles in the degradation of lignite, and potentially tolerance to lignite-breakdown products. There was only a small number of annotated unique genes in the T. cf. simile WF8 genome compared to other fungi, and likely the expression of gene families shared with other fungi is a key factor in lignite biosolubilization by T. cf. simile. The transcriptomes were analyzed of T. cf. simile cultured at two time-points with the lignite-breakdown model compounds 4-phenoxybenzoic acid (which was growth inhibitory), and phenetole and 9-10-dibutoxyanthracene (neither of which inhibited growth), and showed ∼20\% of genes up-regulated by one or more of these compounds. The analysis highlights candidates for characterization and engineering enzyme over-expressing T. cf. simile strains with potentially improved degradation capacity, e.g., laccases and peroxidases, or tolerance and catabolism of breakdown products, e.g., cytochrome P450s, and ring cleavage dioxygenases.},

 abstract = {Bactrocera (Bulladacus) cinnabaria and B. (Bactrocera) propinqua are tephritid fruit flies of the subfamily Dacinae, tribe Dacini. The whole mitogenomes of these two species (first report for the subgenus Bulladacus) possess 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes – PCGs, 2 rRNA and 22 tRNA genes). The mitogenome of B. cinnabaria (15,225 bp) is shorter than that of B. propinqua (15,927 bp), mainly due to the smaller size of the control region and intergenic spacers in B. cinnabaria. Molecular phylogeny based on mitochondrial genes (mt-genes) reveals two clades of the genus Bactrocera: one comprising the subgenus Bactrocera and the other comprising the subgenera Bulladacus, Daculus, Tetradacus and unassigned Bactrocera sp. ‘yunnanensis’. The subgenera represented by two or more taxa are monophyletic. B. (Bulladacus) cinnabaria forms a sister group with the subgenus Tetradacus (B. minax and B. tsuneonis) and B. sp. ‘yunnanensis’, in a clade containing also the basal sister lineage of the subgenus Daculus (B. oleae and B. biguttula). B. propinqua forms a sister group with B. ritsemai and B. limbifera in a subclade containing also B. umbrosa, B. curvifera and B. moluccensis of the monophyletic subgenus Bactrocera. The present study supports the synonymy of B. ruiliensis with B. thailandica. It also shows a high genetic similarity between (a) B. melastomatos and B. rubigina, (b) B. papayae and B. philippinensis, (c) B. dorsalis and B. invadens, (d) B. tryoni and B. neohumeralis, and (e) B. cheni and B. tuberculata; and B. cheni is distinct from and not a synonym of B. tsuneonis or B. lombokensis.},

Here we show that wastewater sequencing analyses are temporally concordant with clinical genomic surveillance and reveal the presence of multiple lineages not detected by clinical surveillance. We show that wastewater genomics can support SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological investigations by reliably recovering the prevalence of local circulating variants, even when clinical samples are not available. Further, we find that analysis of mutations observed in wastewater can provide a signal of upcoming lineage transitions.

 abstract = {Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are a large and diverse group of fungi, which may switch from a saprotrophic to a predatory livestyle if nematodes are present. Different fungi have developed different trapping devices, ranging from adhesive cells to constricting rings. After trapping, fungal hyphae penetrate the worm, secrete lytic enzymes and form a hyphal network inside the body. We sequenced the genome of Duddingtonia flagrans, a biotechnologically important NTF used to control nematode populations in fields. The 36.64 Mb genome encodes 9,927 putative proteins, among which are more than 638 predicted secreted proteins. Most secreted proteins are lytic enzymes, but more than 200 were classified as small secreted proteins ({\textless} 300 amino acids). 117 putative effector proteins were predicted, suggesting interkingdom communication during the colonization. As a first step to analyze the function of such proteins or other phenomena at the molecular level, we developed a transformation system, established the fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry, adapted an assay to monitor protein secretion, and established gene-deletion protocols using homologous recombination or CRISPR/Cas9. One putative effector protein, PefB, was transcriptionally induced during the interaction. We show that the mature protein is able to be imported into nuclei in C. elegans cells. In addition, we studied trap formation and show that cell-to-cell communication is required for ring closure. The availability of the genome sequence and the establishment of many molecular tools will open new avenues to studying this biotechnologically relevant nematode-trapping fungus.},

However, the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF complexes recognize their target loci in plants are not fully understood. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana bromodomain-containing proteins BRD1, BRD2, and BRD13 are core subunits of SWI/SNF complexes and critical for SWI/SNF genomic targeting. These three BRDs interact directly with multiple SWI/SNF subunits, including the BRAHMA (BRM) catalytic subunit. Phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses of the brd1 brd2 brd13 triple mutant revealed that these BRDs act largely redundantly to control gene expression and developmental processes that are also regulated by BRM. Genome-wide occupancy profiling demonstrated that these three BRDs extensively colocalize with BRM on chromatin. Simultaneous loss of function of three BRD genes results in reduced BRM protein levels and decreased occupancy of BRM on chromatin across the genome. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the bromodomains of BRDs are essential for genomic targeting of the BRD subunits of SWI/SNF complexes to their target sites. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BRD1, BRD2, and BRD13 are core subunits of SWI/SNF complexes and reveal their biological roles in facilitating genomic targeting of BRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes in plants.},

In addition to the website platform, we also provide a Docker version that can be easily deployed on private servers. The source code for GRACE is freely available at (https://github.com/th00516/GRACE). Documentation and video tutorials are accessible from website homepage (http://grace.flowhub.com.cn).

Integrins are repeatedly internalized, routed into the endosomal system and either degraded by the lysosome or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The ubiquitin system dictates whether internalized proteins are degraded or recycled. Here, we use a genetic screen and proximity-dependent biotin identification to identify deubiquitinase(s) that control integrin surface levels. We find that a ternary deubiquitinating complex, comprised of USP12 (or the homologous USP46), WDR48 and WDR20, stabilizes β1 integrin (Itgb1) by preventing ESCRT-mediated lysosomal degradation. Mechanistically, the USP12/46-WDR48-WDR20 complex removes ubiquitin from the cytoplasmic tail of internalized Itgb1 in early endosomes, which in turn prevents ESCRT-mediated sorting and Itgb1 degradation.},

@article{yuan_ezh2_2022,
 abstract = {Inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases, but the epigenetic mechanism controlling its activation remains elusive. Here, we found that the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 mediates the activation of multiple types of inflammasomes in macrophages/microglia independent of its methyltransferase activity and thus promotes inflammasome-related pathologies. Mechanistically, Ezh2 functions through its SANT2 domain to maintain the enrichment of H3K27 acetylation in the promoter region of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Neat1, thereby promoting chromatin accessibility and facilitating p65-mediated transcription of Neat1, which is a critical mediator of inflammasome assembly and activation. In addition, the tumour suppressor protein p53 competes with Ezh2 for the same binding region in the Neat1 promoter and thus antagonises Ezh2-induced Neat1 transcription and inflammasome activation. Therefore, loss of Ezh2 strongly promotes the binding of p53, which recruits the deacetylase SIRT1 for H3K27 deacetylation of the Neat1 promoter and thus suppresses Neat1 transcription and inflammasome activation. Overall, our study demonstrates an epigenetic mechanism involved in modulating inflammasome activation through an Ezh2/p53 competition model and highlights a novel function of Ezh2 in maintaining H3K27 acetylation to support lncRNA Neat1 transcription.},

 abstract = {The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) pathway plays a pivotal role in cancer progression, making it a prime target for anticancer drug development. Scutellaria baicalensis, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, harbors bioactive compounds with promising pharmacological properties, including potential EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition. In this study, we employed a comprehensive approach merging cheminformatics and molecular docking techniques to investigate the glioblastoma multiforme inhibitory potentials of the bioactive compounds from the plant, with a focus against EGFR. Our findings revealed significant binding affinities ranging from −9.010 to −6.427 kcal/mol and intricate molecular interactions between compounds from S. baicalensis and the EGFR. Notably, Ganhuangenin, 5,7,2′,5′-tetrahydroxyflavone, (2R)-2-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromene-5,7-diol, and tenaxin I showed particularly high binding affinities, with scores ranging from −9.010 to −8.649 kcal/mol. These compounds even outperformed erlotinib, a standard ligand with a score of −8.539 kcal/mol. Importantly, they interacted with key amino acid residues (Met769, Glu738, and Thr766) through hydrogen bonding. These interactions were driven by specific structural features, including aromatic rings, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and hydrophobic interactions and the reliability of these results was further confirmed through induced-fit docking, reinforcing the potential inhibitory effects of these compounds on the flexible protein. Additionally, all of the top-scoring compounds from S. baicalensis adhered to established drug-likeness rules, including Lipinski's criteria, Ghose's rules, Veber's guidelines, and Egan's rules. However, it's worth noting that scutellarin had some violations in these rules. Remarkably, none of the identified compounds were likely to cause hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, or cytotoxicity, suggesting that they could be considered as safe candidates for anti-cancer agents. This multidisciplinary investigation bridges traditional herbal knowledge and modern drug discovery, offering insights into the potential of S. baicalensis bioactive compounds as novel EGFR-targeting agents. The results underscore the value of chemoinformatics and molecular docking studies in exploring natural compounds for cancer therapy, paving the way for further research in the field.},

 abstract = {Olfactory systems are indispensable for insects as they, including Western Flower Thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), use olfactory cues for ovipositing and feeding. F. occidentalis use odorant binding proteins (OBPs) to transport semiochemicals to odorant receptors to induce a behavioural response from the sensillum lymph of the insect’s antennae. This study identifies four OBPs of F. occidentalis and analyses their expression at three stages of growth: larvae, adult males and adult females. Further, it investigates the presence of conserved motifs and their phylogenetic relationship to other insect species. Moreover, FoccOBP3 was in silico characterized to analyse its structure along with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to understand its binding with semiochemicals of F. occidentalis. Molecular docking revealed the interactions of methyl isonicotinate, p-anisaldehyde and (S)-(-)-verbenone with FoccOBP3. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations showed bonding stability of these ligands with FoccOBP3, and field trials validated that Lurem TR (commercial product) and p-anisaldehyde had greater attraction as compared to (S)-(-)-verbenone, given the compound’s binding with FoccOBP3. The current study helps in understanding the tertiary structure and interaction of FoccOBP3 with lures using computational and field data and will help in the identification of novel lures of insects in the future, given the importance of binding with OBPs.

 abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, particularly the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have shown that MAPK signaling pathway can influence the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), known for its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative diseases. This study explores the modulation of MMP-9 expression via the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade and its potential therapeutic implications in the context of PD-associated motor dysfunction. Here, tolperisone hydrochloride (TL), a muscle relaxant that blocks voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, was used as a treatment to observe its effect on MAPK signaling and MMP-9 expression. Rotenone (RT) exposure in mice resulted in a significant reduction in substantia nigra and primary motor cortex neurons, which were further evidenced by impairments in motor function. When TL was administered, neuron count was restored (89.0 ± 4.78 vs 117.0 ± 4.46/mm2), and most of the motor dysfunction was alleviated. Mechanistically, TL reduced the protein expression of phospho-p38MAPK (1.06 fold vs 1.00 fold) and phospho-ERK1/2 (1.16 fold vs 1.02 fold), leading to the inhibition of MAPK signaling, as well as reduced MMP-9 concentrations (2.76 ± 0.10 vs 1.94 ± 0.10 ng/mL) in the process of rescuing RT-induced neuronal cell death and motor dysfunction. Computational analysis further revealed TL’s potential inhibitory properties against MMP-9 along with N and L-type calcium channels. These findings shed light on TL's neuroprotective effects via MMP-9 inhibition and MAPK signaling downregulation, offering potential therapeutic avenues for PD-associated motor dysfunction.},

@article{zavala-alvarado_transcriptional_2020,
 abstract = {Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of the waterborne zoonotic disease leptospirosis. Leptospira are challenged by numerous adverse conditions, including deadly reactive oxygen species (ROS), when infecting their hosts. Withstanding ROS produced by the host innate immunity is an important strategy evolved by pathogenic Leptospira for persisting in and colonizing hosts. In L. interrogans, genes encoding defenses against ROS are repressed by the peroxide stress regulator, PerR. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize both the L. interrogans response to low and high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the PerR regulon. We showed that Leptospira solicit three main peroxidase machineries (catalase, cytochrome C peroxidase and peroxiredoxin) and heme to detoxify oxidants produced during peroxide stress. In addition, canonical molecular chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins from the SOS response were required for Leptospira recovering from oxidative damage. Identification of the PerR regulon upon exposure to H2O2 allowed to define the contribution of this regulator in the oxidative stress response. This study has revealed a PerR-independent regulatory network involving other transcriptional regulators, two-component systems and sigma factors as well as non-coding RNAs that putatively orchestrate, in concert with PerR, the oxidative stress response. We have shown that PerR-regulated genes encoding a TonB-dependent transporter and a two-component system (VicKR) are involved in Leptospira tolerance to superoxide. This could represent the first defense mechanism against superoxide in L. interrogans, a bacterium lacking canonical superoxide dismutase. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenic Leptospira to overcome oxidative damage during infection-related conditions. This will participate in framing future hypothesis-driven studies to identify and decipher novel virulence mechanisms in this life-threatening pathogen.},

BKS has an important role in the structure of ecological community as key taxa to forming the composition and function. This study determined unique BKS candidates of the secondary forest which may not be found in burned areas. These candidates were detected in silico from the 16S rRNA gene sequence. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) method from peat soil DNA sampled from secondary forest and burned areas in the Giam Siak Kecil Biosphere Reserve, Bukit Batu (GSK-BB). BKS candidates were selected from a phylogenetic tree constructed by using MEGA version 6.06. Selected BKS was in the same cluster as secondary forest and were re-selected using BLASTn: AlignTwo or More Sequence analysis to ensure the uniqueness of the sequences. Based on the selected candidates, specific primers were designed to amplify the 16S rRNA BKS gene. Sensitivity was tested in silico using FastPCR application to ensure that candidates were only in secondary forest. There were 19 BKS candidates found in the secondary forest and not in burnt land (BKS\_SFB) that were classified into three groups. Based on the in silico PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using the designed primer, we obtained two high specificity BKS candidates, i.e. BKS SFB2 (455 bp) and BKS SFB3 (473 bp). The two candidates are potential as DNA barcodes for peatland quality monitoring after burning.},

@article{zehr_patterns_2023,
 abstract = {Viruses may acquire mutations that result in a tropism shift. RNA viruses, such as Coronaviruses (CoVs), are susceptible to tropism shifts. A tropism shift occurs when a virus alters the tissue or cell type it infects, which can have important implications for disease pathogenesis, virulence, transmission, and treatment control. Tropism shifts can occur after cross-species jumps, as well as result from within-host evolution. Beyond the human host, CoVs can be highly pathogenic to a wide variety of wildlife and companion animals. A spillover event from animals to humans, resulting in a tropism shift, has occurred at some point in the evolutionary history of all three highly pathogenic human CoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, studying the evolution of CoVs in non-human animals may be of critical importance for pandemic prevention. This was the focus of my dissertation, to apply state-of-the-art codon models of evolution to a variety of CoV viral sequences to identify how natural selection may alter viral proteins priming them for tropism shifts. Statistical codon models can infer both which codon sites and genes have been subject to positive or negative selection, effectively differentiating signal between random mutations and those that may impact fitness. These models may also compare selection at homologous sites between different phenotypes (i.e., Spike protein sequences isolated from the gastrointestinal tract and those from macrophages) to identify where selection is acting differently between the phenotypes. In chapter 2 I examined a CoV sequence isolated from hospitalized humans in Malaysia that resembled a Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) to investigate how natural selection had shaped the Spike protein sequence in related animal CoV sequences priming it to jump into humans. In chapter 3 I compared the natural selection signals at specific codon positions in the Spike protein from sequences isolated from two separate feline tropisms (gastrointestinal and macrophage) to identity which adaptive mutations may be associated with the tropism shift and subsequent shift in virulence. This was performed on Feline Coronavirus (FCoVs), where almost 90\% of all wild and domestic cats are gastrointestinally infected with FCoVs, and infection becomes highly pathogenic as a result of the shift in tropism to the macrophages. Since intra-host evolution can impact tropism shifts, in Chapter 4 I performed a detailed high-throughout analysis of intra-host evolution of RNAseq data of Equine Coronavirus (ECoV), as well as natural selection analyses of related embecoviruses that have colonized the human host. Taken together, I report on novel signals of natural selection across viral proteins, with an emphasis on Spike, on a diverse set of CoV clades that shed light on the complexities of coronavirus evolution as it relates to tropism shifts.},

This study introduces the genome sequence of P. infestans Karsten DSM 5139 (Phain), obtained through Pacbio technology. The assembly resulted in 44 contigs, with a total genome size of 36,805,277 bp and a Guanine–Cytosine content of 46.4\%. Genome-mining revealed numerous putative biosynthetic gene clusters that code for virulence factors and fungal toxins. The presence of the enzyme pisatin demethylase was indicative of the potential of Phain to detoxify its environment from the terpenoid phytoalexins produced by its host as a defense mechanism. Proteomic analysis revealed the potential survival strategies of Phain under the snow, which included the production of antifreeze proteins, trehalose synthesis enzymes, desaturases, proteins related to elongation of very long-chain fatty acids, and stress protein responses. Study of protein GH11 endoxylanase expressed in Escherichia coli showed an acidic optimum pH (pH 5.0) and a low optimum temperature (45 °C), which is reflective of the living conditions of the fungus. Mass spectrometry analysis of the methanol extract of Phain, incubated at − 3 °C and 22 °C, revealed differences in the produced metabolites. Both genomic and mass spectrometry analyses showed the ability of Phain to adapt its metabolic processes and secretome to freezing temperatures through the production of osmoprotectant and cryoprotectant metabolites. This comprehensive exploration of Phain's genome sequence, proteome, and secretome not only advances our understanding of its unique adaptive mechanisms but also expands the possibilities of biotechnological applications.},

 abstract = {Continual climate change strongly influences temperature conditions worldwide, making ectothermic animals as suitable species for studying the potential impact of climate change on global biodiversity. However, the study of how lizards distributed at different latitudes respond to climate change at the transcriptome level is still insufficient. According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis (CVH), the range of climate fluctuations experienced by terrestrial animals throughout the year increases with latitude, so individuals at higher latitudes should exhibit greater thermal plasticity to cope with fluctuating environments. Mitochondria, as the energy center of vertebrate cells, may indicate species’ plasticity through the sensitivity of gene expression. In this study, we focused on the changes in transcript levels of liver mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCGs) in skinks from the genus Plestiodon (P. capito and P. elegans) and the genus Scincella (S. modesta and S. reevesii) under low-temperature conditions of 8 °C, compared to the control group at 25 °C. Species within the same genus of skinks exhibit different latitudinal distribution patterns. We found that the two Plestiodon species, P. elegans and P. capito, employ a metabolic depression strategy (decreased transcript levels) to cope with low temperatures. In contrast, the two Scincella species show markedly different patterns: S. modesta exhibits significant increases in the transcript levels of six genes (metabolic compensation), while in S. reevesii, only two mitochondrial genes are downregulated (metabolic depression) compared to the control group. We also found that P. capito and S. modesta, which live at mid-to-high latitudes, exhibit stronger adaptive responses and plasticity at the mitochondrial gene level compared to P. elegans and S. reevesii, which live at lower latitudes. We suggest that this enhanced adaptability corresponds to more significant changes in a greater number of genes (plasticity genes).},

In order to determine whether the different color phenotypes of Nedyopus patrioticus require separate taxonomic status or are simply synonyms, here, the complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of two different colored N. patrioticus, i.e., red N. patrioticus and white N. patrioticus, are presented. The two mitogenomes were 15,781 bp and 15,798 bp in length, respectively. Each mitogenome contained 13 PCGs, 19 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 1 CR, with a lack of trnI, trnL2, and trnV compared to other Polydesmida species. All genes were located on a single strand in two mitogenomes. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that red N. patrioticus and white N. patrioticus did not show clear evolutionary differences. Furthermore, no significant divergence was discovered by means of base composition analysis. As a result, we suggest that white N. patrioticus might be regarded as a synonym for red N. patrioticus. The current findings confirmed the existence of color polymorphism in N. patrioticus, which provides exciting possibilities for future research. It is necessary to apply a combination of molecular and morphological methods in the taxonomy of millipedes.},

In the Arabidopsis root, the quiescent center (QC) acts as a stem cell organizer, signaling to the neighboring stem cells. WOX5 is a central transcription factor regulating QC function. However, due to the scarcity of QC cells, WOX5 functions in the QC are largely unexplored at a genomic scale. Here, we unveil the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of the QC and the role of WOX5 within them. We find that WOX5 functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator, affecting histone modifications and chromatin accessibility. Our data expand on known WOX5 functions, such as the regulation of differentiation, cell division, and auxin biosynthesis. We also uncover unexpected WOX5-regulated pathways involved in nitrate transport and the regulation of basal expression levels of genes associated with mature root tissues. These data suggest a role for QC cells as reserve stem cells and primed cells for prospective progenitor fates. Taken together, these findings offer insights into the role of WOX5 at the QC and provide a basis for further analyses to advance our understanding of the nature of plant stem cell organizers.},

The gene ND4L used TGA as the initiation codon, while the other PCGs utilized ATN (A, T, G, C) as the initiation codons. More than half of the PCGs used T as an incomplete termination codon. The transcription direction of the L. scaber mitogenome matched Spirobolus bungii, in contrast to most millipedes. Novel rearrangements were found in the L. scaber mitogenome: trnQ -trnC and trnL1- trnP underwent short-distance translocations and the gene block rrnS-rrnL-ND1 moved to a position between ND4 and ND5, resulting in the formation of a novel gene order. The phylogenetic analysis showed that L. scaber is most closely related to S. bungii, followed by Narceus magnum.

@article{zhang_nfatc1_2023,
 abstract = {Background \& Aims
Loss of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) fosters acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic carcinogenesis by down-regulating transcription programs controlling acinar cell identity. However, how ARID1A reacts to metaplasia-triggering environmental cues remains elusive. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of ARID1A in controlling ductal pancreatic gene signatures and deciphering hierarchical signaling cues determining ARID1A-dependent chromatin regulation during acinar cell reprogramming.
Methods
Acinar cell explants with differential ARID1A status were subjected to genome-wide expression analyses. The impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, NFATc1 activity, and ARID1A status on acinar reprogramming processes were characterized by ex vivo ADM assays and transgenic mouse models. EGFR-dependent ARID1A chromatin binding was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis and cellular fractionation.
Results
EGFR signaling interferes with ARID1A-dependent transcription by inducing genome-wide ARID1A displacement, thereby phenocopying ARID1A loss-of-function mutations and inducing a shift toward ADM permissive ductal transcription programs. Moreover, we show that EGFR signaling is required to push ARID1A-deficient acinar cells toward a metaplastic phenotype. Mechanistically, we identified the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 as the central regulatory hub mediating both EGFR signaling-induced genomic ARID1A displacement and the induction of ADM-promoting gene signatures in the absence of ARID1A. Consequently, pharmacologic inhibition of NFATc1 or its depletion in transgenic mice not only preserves genome-wide ARID1A occupancy, but also attenuates acinar metaplasia led by ARID1A loss.
Conclusions
Our data describe an intimate relationship between environmental signaling and chromatin remodeling in orchestrating cell fate decisions in the pancreas, and illustrate how ARID1A loss influences transcriptional regulation in acinar cell reprogramming.},

@article{zhang_replication_2022,
 abstract = {Transcription replication collisions (TRCs) constitute a major intrinsic source of genome instability but conclusive evidence for a causal role of TRCs in tumor initiation is missing. We discover that lack of the H4K20-dimethyltransferase KMT5B (also known as SUV4-20H1) in muscle stem cells de-represses S-phase transcription by increasing H4K20me1 levels, which induces TRCs and aberrant R-loops in oncogenic genes. The resulting replication stress and aberrant mitosis activate ATR-RPA32-P53 signaling, promoting cellular senescence, which turns into rapid rhabdomyosarcoma formation when p53 is absent. Inhibition of S-phase transcription ameliorates TRCs and formation of R-loops in Kmt5b-deficient MuSCs, validating the crucial role of H4K20me1-dependent, tightly controlled S-phase transcription for preventing collision errors. Low KMT5B expression is prevalent in human sarcomas and associated with tumor recurrence, suggesting a common function of KMT5B in sarcoma formation. The study uncovers decisive functions of KMT5B for maintaining genome stability by repressing S-phase transcription via control of H4K20me1 levels.},

@article{zhao_nodulating_2024,
 abstract = {Aeschynomene indica rhizobia (AIRs) are special classes of bacteria capable of nodulating without nodulation factors and have photosynthetic capacity. With an aim to characterize the structural variations in Bradyrhizobium genomes during its evolution, the genomes of AIRs and the reference Bradyrhizobium strains were compared utilizing molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biochemistry techniques. The presence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (nif) genes and photosynthetic genes, as well as components of the T3SS (Type III secretion system) and T3CP (Type III chaperone) in the genome of AIRs, was also assessed. Additionally, the origin, evolutionary history, and genes associated with the NF-independent nodulation pattern in AIRs were explored. The results indicate that horizontal gene transfer events have occurred in AIRs, and three distinct origins of AIRs were estimated: early differentiated AIRs, non-symbiotic Bradyrhizobium, and non-AIRs. In contrast to the significant genetic transformations observed in the second and third groups, the first group of AIRs displays a rich evolutionary history, exhibits high species diversity, and primarily relies on vertical transmission of nitrogen fixation and photosynthetic genes. Overall, the findings provide a fundamental theoretical foundation for gaining a deeper understanding of the phylogeny and genealogy of AIRs.},

@article{zhao_rrm_2024,
 abstract = {Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including RNA processing and DNA methylation/demethylation. How these regulations are controlled remains unclear. Here, through analysis of a suppressor for the OsEIN2 over-expressor, we identified an RNA recognition motif protein SUPPRESSOR OF EIN2 (SOE). SOE is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with several components of the spliceosome. We find SOE associates with hundreds of targets and directly binds to a DNA glycosylase gene DNG701 pre-mRNA for efficient splicing and stabilization, allowing for subsequent DNG701-mediated DNA demethylation of the transgene promoter for proper gene expression. The V81M substitution in the suppressor mutant protein mSOE impaired its protein stability and binding activity to DNG701 pre-mRNA, leading to transgene silencing. SOE mutation enhances grain size and yield. Haplotype analysis in c. 3000 rice accessions reveals that the haplotype 1 (Hap 1) promoter is associated with high 1000-grain weight, and most of the japonica accessions, but not indica ones, have the Hap 1 elite allele. Our study discovers a novel mechanism for the regulation of gene expression and provides an elite allele for the promotion of yield potentials in rice.},

 abstract = {Benzophenones (BPs) are commonly used in personal care products like sunscreens and are increasingly being released into the environment, raising concerns about their potential ecotoxic effects. BPs as emerging environmental contaminants, little is known about their toxic effects on estuarine organisms. This study firstly investigated the toxic effects of five commonly used BPs on mud crabs (Scylla paramamosain). The crabs were exposed to varying concentrations of BPs for 14 days. The results showed that BPs caused damage to antioxidant systems in crabs. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that BP-3 and BP-1 had a greater impact on the crabs compared to the other BPs. Specifically, BP-1 and BP-3 caused severe damage to organelles and ribosomes. BP affected catalytic activity and hydrolase activity, BP-2 affected phosphoenolpyruate carboxykinase activity, and BP-4 affected tRNA aminoacylation and hydrolase activity. These findings can enhance our understanding of the ecotoxicity of BPs and may help to protect estuarine ecosystems.},

Although this increase provides a unique opportunity for the generation of the first comprehensive Human Gut Cell Atlas (HGCA), there remains a range of major challenges ahead. Above all, the ultimate success will largely depend on a structured and coordinated approach that aligns global efforts undertaken by a large number of research groups. In this Roadmap, we discuss a comprehensive forward-thinking direction for the generation of the HGCA on behalf of the Gut Biological Network of the Human Cell Atlas. Based on the consensus opinion of experts from across the globe, we outline the main requirements for the first complete HGCA by summarizing existing data sets and highlighting anatomical regions and/or tissues with limited coverage. We provide recommendations for future studies and discuss key methodologies and the importance of integrating the healthy gut atlas with related diseases and gut organoids. Importantly, we critically overview the computational tools available and provide recommendations to overcome key challenges.},

@article{zinati_deciphering_2023,
 abstract = {Abiotic stress in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) may trigger distinct transcriptome responses, resulting in significant yield loss. More insight into the molecular underpinnings of the stress response can be gained by combining RNA-Seq meta-analysis with systems biology and machine learning. This can help pinpoint possible targets for engineering abiotic tolerance by revealing functional modules and key genes essential for the stress response. Therefore, to investigate the regulatory mechanism and key genes, a combination of these approaches was utilized in cucumber subjected to various abiotic stresses. Three significant abiotic stress-related modules were identified by gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Three hub genes (RPL18, δ-COP, and EXLA2), ten transcription factors (TFs), one transcription regulator, and 12 protein kinases (PKs) were introduced as key genes. The results suggest that the identified PKs probably govern the coordination of cellular responses to abiotic stress in cucumber. Moreover, the C2H2 TF family may play a significant role in cucumber response to abiotic stress. Several C2H2 TF target stress-related genes were identified through co-expression and promoter analyses. Evaluation of the key identified genes using Random Forest, with an area under the curve of ROC (AUC) of 0.974 and an accuracy rate of 88.5\%, demonstrates their prominent contributions in the cucumber response to abiotic stresses. These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying abiotic stress response in cucumber and pave the way for cucumber genetic engineering toward improving tolerance ability under abiotic stress.},

@article{zirngibl_triose_2023,
 abstract = {Plants have evolved multiple strategies to cope with rapid changes in the environment. During high light (HL) acclimation, the biosynthesis of photoprotective flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, is induced. However, the exact nature of the signal and downstream factors for HL induction of flavonoid biosynthesis (FB) is still under debate. Here, we show that carbon fixation in chloroplasts, subsequent export of photosynthates by triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT), and rapid increase in cellular sugar content permit the transcriptional and metabolic activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis during HL acclimation. In combination with genetic and physiological analysis, targeted and whole-transcriptome gene expression studies suggest that reactive oxygen species and phytohormones play only a minor role in rapid HL induction of the anthocyanin branch of FB. In addition to transcripts of FB, sugar-responsive genes showed delayed repression or induction in tpt-2 during HL treatment, and a significant overlap with transcripts regulated by SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) was observed, including a central transcription factor of FB. Analysis of mutants with increased and repressed SnRK1 activity suggests that sugar-induced inactivation of SnRK1 is required for HL-mediated activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our study emphasizes the central role of chloroplasts as sensors for environmental changes as well as the vital function of sugar signaling in plant acclimation.},
