@article{rajczewski_rigorous_2021,
 abstract = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has had a profound, lasting impact on the world's population. A key aspect to providing care for those with COVID-19 and checking its further spread is early and accurate diagnosis of infection, which has been generally done via methods for amplifying and detecting viral RNA molecules. Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting; many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples. However, evidence suggests that some viral peptides could serve as better indicators of COVID-19 infection status than others, due to potential misidentification of peptides derived from human host proteins, poor spectral quality, high limits of detection etc.},

    abstract = "{Galaxy is a web-based and open-source scientific data-processing platform. Researchers compose pipelines in Galaxy to analyse scientific data. These pipelines, also known as workflows, can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To help researchers with creating workflows, a system is developed to recommend tools that can facilitate further data analysis.A model is developed to recommend tools using a deep learning approach by analysing workflows composed by researchers on the European Galaxy server. The higher-order dependencies in workflows, represented as directed acyclic graphs, are learned by training a gated recurrent units neural network, a variant of a recurrent neural network. In the neural network training, the weights of tools used are derived from their usage frequencies over time and the sequences of tools are uniformly sampled from training data. Hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. Mean accuracy of 98\\% in recommending tools is achieved for the top-1 metric.The model is accessed by a Galaxy API to provide researchers with recommended tools in an interactive manner using multiple user interface integrations on the European Galaxy server. High-quality and highly used tools are shown at the top of the recommendations. The scripts and data to create the recommendation system are available under MIT license at https://github.com/anuprulez/galaxy\_tool\_recommendation.}",

    abstract = {Author summary Everything we do today is becoming more and more reliant on the use of computers. The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it’s sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They’re often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [FAIR] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.},

In addition, it implements a group of pipelines to estimate the impact of each dataset by tracing the number of citations, reanalysis and biological entities reported by each dataset. Here, we present the OmicsDI REST interface (www.omicsdi.org/ws/) to enable programmatic access to any dataset in OmicsDI or all the datasets for a specific provider (database). Clients can perform queries on the API using different metadata information such as sample details (species, tissues, etc), instrumentation (mass spectrometer, sequencer), keywords and other provided annotations.

                  the majority of the DNA in eukaryotic genomes is
                  transcribed. Advanced high-throughput techniques like CLIP
                  for the genome-wide detection of RNA-protein interactions
                  have shown that post-transcriptional regulation by
                  RNA-binding proteins matches the complexity of
                  transcriptional regulation. The need for a specialized and
                  integrated analysis of RNA-based data has led to the
                  foundation of the RNA Bioinformatics Center (RBC) within the
                  German Network of Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).
                  This paper describes the tools, services and databases
                  provided by the RBC, and shows example applications.
                  Furthermore, we have setup an RNA workbench within the

  abstract =	 {RNA-based regulation has become a major research topic in
                  molecular biology. The analysis of epigenetic and expression
                  data is therefore incomplete if RNA-based regulation is not
                  taken into account. Thus, it is increasingly important but
                  not yet standard to combine RNA-centric data and analysis
                  tools with other types of experimental data such as RNA-seq
                  or ChIP-seq. Here, we present the RNA workbench, a
                  comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated
                  workflows that enable the researcher to combine these two
                  worlds. Based on the Galaxy framework the workbench
                  guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption
                  to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses
                  that are independent of command-line knowledge. Currently,
                  it includes more than 50 bioinformatics tools that are
                  dedicated to different research areas of RNA biology
                  including RNA structure analysis, RNA alignment, RNA
                  annotation, RNA-protein interaction, ribosome profiling,
                  RNA-seq analysis and RNA target prediction. The workbench is
                  developed and maintained by experts in RNA bioinformatics
                  and the Galaxy framework. Together with the growing
                  community evolving around this workbench, we are committed
                  to keep the workbench up-to-date for future standards and
                  needs, providing researchers with a reliable and robust
                  framework for RNA data analysis. AVAILABILITY: The RNA
                  workbench is available at
                  https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.}

    abstract = "{RNA has become one of the major research topics in molecular biology. As a central player in key processes regulating gene expression, RNA is in the focus of many efforts to decipher the pathways that govern the transition of genetic information to a fully functional cell. As more and more researchers join this endeavour, there is a rapidly growing demand for comprehensive collections of tools that cover the diverse layers of RNA-related research. However, increasing amounts of data, from diverse types of experiments, addressing different aspects of biological questions need to be consolidated and integrated into a single framework. Only then is it possible to connect findings from e.g. RNA-Seq experiments and methods for e.g. target predictions. To address these needs, we present the RNA Workbench 2.0 , an updated online resource for RNA related analysis. With the RNA Workbench we created a comprehensive set of analysis tools and workflows that enables researchers to analyze their data without the need for sophisticated command-line skills. This update takes the established framework to the next level, providing not only a containerized infrastructure for analysis, but also a ready-to-use platform for hands-on training, analysis, data exploration, and visualization. The new framework is available at https://rna.usegalaxy.eu , and login is free and open to all users. The containerized version can be found at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.}",

  abstract = {The increasing complexity of data and analysis methods has created an environment where scientists, who may not have formal training, are finding themselves playing the impromptu role of software engineer. While several resources are available for introducing scientists to the basics of programming, researchers have been left with little guidance on approaches needed to advance to the next level for the development of robust, large-scale data analysis tools that are amenable to integration into workflow management systems, tools, and frameworks. The integration into such workflow systems necessitates additional requirements on computational tools, such as adherence to standard conventions for robustness, data input, output, logging, and flow control. Here we provide a set of 10 guidelines to steer the creation of command-line computational tools that are usable, reliable, extensible, and in line with standards of modern coding practices.},
