  abstract =	 {What does it take to convert a heap of sequencing data into
                  a publishable result? First, common tools are employed to
                  reduce primary data (sequencing reads) to a form suitable
                  for further analyses (i.e., the list of variable sites). The
                  subsequent exploratory stage is much more ad hoc and
                  requires the development of custom scripts and pipelines,
                  making it problematic for biomedical researchers. Here, we
                  describe a hybrid platform combining common analysis
                  pathways with the ability to explore data interactively. It
                  aims to fully encompass and simplify the "raw
                  data-to-publication" pathway and make it reproducible.}

  abstract =	 {The importance of RNA-based regulation is becoming more and
                  more evident. Genome-wide sequencing efforts have shown that
                  the majority of the DNA in eukaryotic genomes is
                  transcribed. Advanced high-throughput techniques like CLIP
                  for the genome-wide detection of RNA-protein interactions
                  have shown that post-transcriptional regulation by
                  RNA-binding proteins matches the complexity of
                  transcriptional regulation. The need for a specialized and
                  integrated analysis of RNA-based data has led to the
                  foundation of the RNA Bioinformatics Center (RBC) within the
                  German Network of Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).
                  This paper describes the tools, services and databases
                  provided by the RBC, and shows example applications.
                  Furthermore, we have setup an RNA workbench within the
                  Galaxy framework. For an easy dissemination, we offer a
                  virtualized version of Galaxy (via Galaxy Docker) enabling
                  other groups to use our RNA workbench in a very simple way.}

  abstract =	 {RNA-based regulation has become a major research topic in
                  molecular biology. The analysis of epigenetic and expression
                  data is therefore incomplete if RNA-based regulation is not
                  taken into account. Thus, it is increasingly important but
                  not yet standard to combine RNA-centric data and analysis
                  tools with other types of experimental data such as RNA-seq
                  or ChIP-seq. Here, we present the RNA workbench, a
                  comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated
                  workflows that enable the researcher to combine these two
                  worlds. Based on the Galaxy framework the workbench
                  guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption
                  to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses
                  that are independent of command-line knowledge. Currently,
                  it includes more than 50 bioinformatics tools that are
                  dedicated to different research areas of RNA biology
                  including RNA structure analysis, RNA alignment, RNA
                  annotation, RNA-protein interaction, ribosome profiling,
                  RNA-seq analysis and RNA target prediction. The workbench is
                  developed and maintained by experts in RNA bioinformatics
                  and the Galaxy framework. Together with the growing
                  community evolving around this workbench, we are committed
                  to keep the workbench up-to-date for future standards and
                  needs, providing researchers with a reliable and robust
                  framework for RNA data analysis. AVAILABILITY: The RNA
                  workbench is available at
                  https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.}

    abstract = "{RNA has become one of the major research topics in molecular biology. As a central player in key processes regulating gene expression, RNA is in the focus of many efforts to decipher the pathways that govern the transition of genetic information to a fully functional cell. As more and more researchers join this endeavour, there is a rapidly growing demand for comprehensive collections of tools that cover the diverse layers of RNA-related research. However, increasing amounts of data, from diverse types of experiments, addressing different aspects of biological questions need to be consolidated and integrated into a single framework. Only then is it possible to connect findings from e.g. RNA-Seq experiments and methods for e.g. target predictions. To address these needs, we present the RNA Workbench 2.0 , an updated online resource for RNA related analysis. With the RNA Workbench we created a comprehensive set of analysis tools and workflows that enables researchers to analyze their data without the need for sophisticated command-line skills. This update takes the established framework to the next level, providing not only a containerized infrastructure for analysis, but also a ready-to-use platform for hands-on training, analysis, data exploration, and visualization. The new framework is available at https://rna.usegalaxy.eu , and login is free and open to all users. The containerized version can be found at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.}",

While several resources are available for introducing scientists to the basics of programming, researchers have been left with little guidance on approaches needed to advance to the next level for the development of robust, large-scale data analysis tools that are amenable to integration into workflow management systems, tools, and frameworks. The integration into such workflow systems necessitates additional requirements on computational tools, such as adherence to standard conventions for robustness, data input, output, logging, and flow control. Here we provide a set of 10 guidelines to steer the creation of command-line computational tools that are usable, reliable, extensible, and in line with standards of modern coding practices.},
