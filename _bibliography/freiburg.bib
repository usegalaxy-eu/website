    abstract = {Science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields change rapidly and are increasingly interdisciplinary. Commonly, STEMM practitioners use short-format training (SFT) such as workshops and short courses for upskilling and reskilling, but unaddressed challenges limit SFT’s effectiveness and inclusiveness. Education researchers, students in SFT courses, and organizations have called for research and strategies that can strengthen SFT in terms of effectiveness, inclusiveness, and accessibility across multiple dimensions. This paper describes the project that resulted in a consensus set of 14 actionable recommendations to systematically strengthen SFT. A diverse international group of 30 experts in education, accessibility, and life sciences came together from 10 countries to develop recommendations that can help strengthen SFT globally. Participants, including representation from some of the largest life science training programs globally, assembled findings in the educational sciences and encompassed the experiences of several of the largest life science SFT programs. The 14 recommendations were derived through a Delphi method, where consensus was achieved in real time as the group completed a series of meetings and tasks designed to elicit specific recommendations. Recommendations cover the breadth of SFT contexts and stakeholder groups and include actions for instructors (e.g., make equity and inclusion an ethical obligation), programs (e.g., centralize infrastructure for assessment and evaluation), as well as organizations and funders (e.g., professionalize training SFT instructors; deploy SFT to counter inequity). Recommendations are aligned with a purpose-built framework—“The Bicycle Principles”—that prioritizes evidenced-based teaching, inclusiveness, and equity, as well as the ability to scale, share, and sustain SFT. We also describe how the Bicycle Principles and recommendations are consistent with educational change theories and can overcome systemic barriers to delivering consistently effective, inclusive, and career-spanning SFT.},

	abstract = {A global genome database of all of Earth{\textquoteright}s species diversity could be a treasure trove of scientific discoveries. However, regardless of the major advances in genome sequencing technologies, only a tiny fraction of species have genomic information available. To contribute to a more complete planetary genomic database, scientists and institutions across the world have united under the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), which plans to sequence and assemble high-quality reference genomes for all \~{}1.5 million recognized eukaryotic species through a stepwise phased approach. As the initiative transitions into Phase II, where 150,000 species are to be sequenced in just four years, worldwide participation in the project will be fundamental to success. As the European node of the EBP, the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) seeks to implement a new decentralised, accessible, equitable and inclusive model for producing high-quality reference genomes, which will inform EBP as it scales. To embark on this mission, ERGA launched a Pilot Project to establish a network across Europe to develop and test the first infrastructure of its kind for the coordinated and distributed reference genome production on 98 European eukaryotic species from sample providers across 33 European countries. Here we outline the process and challenges faced during the development of a pilot infrastructure for the production of reference genome resources, and explore the effectiveness of this approach in terms of high-quality reference genome production, considering also equity and inclusion. The outcomes and lessons learned during this pilot provide a solid foundation for ERGA while offering key learnings to other transnational and national genomic resource projects.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Biodiversity genomicsThe application of genomic methods to research biodiversity.BUSCOA bioinformatic method (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologues) used to estimate the completeness of the coding fraction of an organism{\textquoteright}s genome based on the proportion of (lineage specific) single copy orthologous genes that are found in a genome assembly 51.INSDCInternational Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (https://www.insdc.org/) is an initiative between the DDBJ, EMBL-EBI and NCBI that together act as a global repository of sequence data and associated metadata, and provide tools and services that allow access to genomic resources.Reference genomeAn accepted standard representation of an organism{\textquoteright}s DNA sequence. High-quality reference genomes typically have high completeness (chromosome-level with few gaps in sequence), few errors, and are annotated and accessible. A reference genome serves as a tool for alignment-based analyses, such as variant calling or RNAseq, and has many other applications, for example, phylogenetics and evolutionary relationships, identification of genes and variants, functional analysis and comparative genomics. Reference genomes referred to as {\textquotedblleft}drafts{\textquotedblright} are those that are under active construction and refinement, and not yet finalised through manual curation.Genomic resourceA genomic resource, for the purpose of this manuscript, refers to a reference genome, genome annotation, voucher specimen, cryopreserved sample and comprehensive metadata.FAIR PrinciplesA set of principles to guide appropriate management and curation of scientific data (https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) that emphasise data accessibility and use by ensuring that data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Due to the increasing amount of scientific data being reposited, FAIR guidelines promote a data format that is amenable to automated computational access of data by stakeholders63.CARE PrinciplesThe CARE principles for Indigenous data governance (https://www.gida-global.org/care) provide a governance framework that supports the recognition of rights and interests Indigenous Peoples{\textquoteright} to their physical and digital data as well as their Indigenous Knowledges64.MetadataA collection of data that provides contextual information about multiple characteristics of other, corresponding original data.VoucherA voucher specimen is a permanently preserved object (either whole or in part, and/or physical or digital) of an identified organism (verified by a recognised expert) and which is deposited in an accessible facility or database. A voucher provides physical evidence about any specimen{\textquoteright}s taxonomic identity14. Voucher deposition is a best practice for conducting biodiversity genomics research.(Genome) annotationThe process of identifying the functions of different pieces of a genome. This includes genes that code for proteins and non coding features (e.g. intron-exon structure of protein coding genes, promotors, transposable elements). Typically performed using computational methods, followed by manual curation.(Genome) completenessAn estimate of how well a reference genome represents the complete sequence of the target organism. A complete genome should equal the haploid genome size of the target, but may be defined when {\textquoteleft}all chromosomes are gapless and have no runs of 10 or more ambiguous bases, there are no unplaced or unlocalized scaffolds, and all expected chromosomes are present.{\textquoteright} (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/). There are different approaches to estimate the completeness, like BUSCO, analysing K-mers, etc.LibraryDNA, cDNA, or RNA that has been prepared for NGS within (usually) a specific size range and containing adapters, which are designed to be appropriate for (a) specific sequencing platform(s).(Genome) assemblyA genome assembly is a representation of an organism{\textquoteright}s genome that is made using computer programs to turn (assemble) raw sequence data into longer, continuous sequences.PUIDA permanent unique identifier is a unique label for an object that does not change, such as the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) attached with a scientific publication.ENAThe European Nucleotide Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) is a global repository for sequence data and provides resources that support management and access to sequence data.Equity DeservingAccording to the Canadian Council (https://canadacouncil.ca/glossary/equity-seeking-groups) equity deserving groups are those individual researchers, communities, Peoples, regions or countries that have identified barriers to equal access, opportunities, and resources due to disadvantage and/or discrimination and that are actively seeking, and deserving of social justice and reparation. The discrimination experienced could be caused by attitudinal, historic, social, and environmental barriers that could be based on a plethora of characteristics that are including (but not limited to) sex, age, ethnicity, disability, economic status, gender, gender expression, nationality, race, sexual orientation, and creed.COPOThe Collaborative OPen Omics (COPO) platform is for researchers to publish their research assets, providing metadata annotation and deposition capability. It allows researchers to describe their datasets according to community standards and broker the submission of such data to appropriate repositories whilst tracking the resulting accessions/identifiers28.Open dataOpen data are freely accessible and unrestricted data that can be accessed, used, reused and shared with third parties for any purpose.HSMHierarchical Storage Management is both a data management and data storage technique which transparently manages the movement of data between the different layers of a tiered storage based on file size thresholds, usage and I/O pressure. Usually, a tiered storage is composed of one or more layers of disk arrays, ordered by capacity, latency, redundancy and storage cost. A slow but economically effective archival layer is at the bottom, composed of magnetic tape libraries and automated tape robots, with the highest capacity and latency. The movement between layers is automatically triggered.ONTOxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT; https://nanoporetech.com/) is a next generation sequencing technology whereby sequence data are generated from the changes in current that occur as single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules pass through nanoscale protein pores (nanopores). ONT provides long read data (up to several megabases) that facilitate genome assembly65,66.PacBioPacific Biosciences (PacBio; https://www.pacb.com/) is a single-molecule, real time (SMRT) next generation sequencing technology in which sequence data are generated by fluorescent light emission that occurs when a DNA polymerase adds nucleotides. PacBio produces long read data (tens of kilobases) that facilitate genome assembly.HiFi readsHiFi (High Fidelity) PacBio reads are produced by taking multiple sequences of the same molecule to provide a consensus sequence that is usually 12-20kbp long and has a low error rate (\&gt;99.9 \% consensus accuracy)67.Hi-CSequencing-based method used to study three-dimensional interactions among chromatin regions by measuring the frequency of contact between pairs of loci. Since contact frequency is related to the distance between a pair of loci, Hi-C linking information is used to help with scaffolding stages during a genome assembly process.Hi-C map / graph productionThe occurrence and frequency of Hi-C contacts are analysed and used in assembly scaffolding. They are typically visualised in Hi-C 2D heatmaps with the full genome sequence on the X and Y axis and a markup for each observed contact.Omni-CModified version of Hi-C that uses a sequence-independent endonuclease during its protocol to produce more even sequence coverage increasing overall resolution.RNA-SeqRNA-Seq is a technique that determines the complete or partial RNA sequence using NGS. The RNA expression profiles vary in different tissues of the same organism and can be influenced by physiopathological circumstances. RNA-Seq data facilitate genome assembly by providing empirical evidence for annotation of transcribed regions68.IsoSeqThis is a sequencing protocol developed by PacBio that aims to sequence full-length transcripts using the accurate, long read capabilities of PacBio HiFi technology. IsoSeq data facilitate analysis of transcriptomes and genome annotation by identifying full-length isoforms of transcripts.HaplotypeA haplotype refers to the collection of genetic material within an organism that is inherited together. Haplotype may be used to describe a few loci or any number of chromosomes (a chromosome-scale haplotype).K-merA K-mer is a DNA sequence of length k; for example, the sequence AGCT contains the 3-mers (K-mers of length 3) AGC and GCT.TranscriptomeA transcriptome is a set of aligned RNAseq reads representing RNA collected from a sample or collection of samples. This includes both protein-coding and non-coding transcripts. For the ERGA Pilot Project, poly-A+ transcripts were profiled.Interested PartiesThis term, for the purposes of this manuscript refers to the range of external stakeholders (e.g., commercial companies, policymakers etc) and rights holders (e.g., Indigenous Peoples) that have an interest in biodiversity genomics research.EBP Genome assembly quality standard 6..Q40Minimum reference standard of 6.C.Q40, i.e. megabase N50 contig continuity and chromosomal scale N50 scaffolding, with less than 1/10,000 error rate. For species with chromosome N50 smaller than a megabase this will be C.C.Q40. Additional recommendations include K-mer completeness \&gt;90\%, BUSCO complete single-copy single \&gt;90\%, BUSCO complete single duplicate \&lt; 5\%, and Gaps/Gbp \&lt;1000.Widening CountryWidening countries are countries with low participation rates in FP7 and H2020 projects (low level of investment into research and innovation (R\&amp;I)). According to the Horizon Europe regulation the Widening countries are: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and all associated countries with equivalent characteristics in terms of R\&amp;I performance and the Outermost Regions.},

 abstract = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has had a profound, lasting impact on the world's population. A key aspect to providing care for those with COVID-19 and checking its further spread is early and accurate diagnosis of infection, which has been generally done via methods for amplifying and detecting viral RNA molecules. Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting; many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples. However, evidence suggests that some viral peptides could serve as better indicators of COVID-19 infection status than others, due to potential misidentification of peptides derived from human host proteins, poor spectral quality, high limits of detection etc.},

These pipelines, also known as workflows, can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To help researchers with creating workflows, a system is developed to recommend tools that can facilitate further data analysis.A model is developed to recommend tools using a deep learning approach by analysing workflows composed by researchers on the European Galaxy server. The higher-order dependencies in workflows, represented as directed acyclic graphs, are learned by training a gated recurrent units neural network, a variant of a recurrent neural network. In the neural network training, the weights of tools used are derived from their usage frequencies over time and the sequences of tools are uniformly sampled from training data. Hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. Mean accuracy of 98\\% in recommending tools is achieved for the top-1 metric.The model is accessed by a Galaxy API to provide researchers with recommended tools in an interactive manner using multiple user interface integrations on the European Galaxy server. High-quality and highly used tools are shown at the top of the recommendations. The scripts and data to create the recommendation system are available under MIT license at https://github.com/anuprulez/galaxy\_tool\_recommendation.}",

    abstract = {Author summary Everything we do today is becoming more and more reliant on the use of computers. The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it’s sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They’re often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [FAIR] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.},

OmicsDI integrates proteomics, genomics, metabolomics, models and transcriptomics datasets. Using an efficient indexing system, OmicsDI integrates different biological entities including genes, transcripts, proteins, metabolites and the corresponding publications from PubMed. In addition, it implements a group of pipelines to estimate the impact of each dataset by tracing the number of citations, reanalysis and biological entities reported by each dataset. Here, we present the OmicsDI REST interface (www.omicsdi.org/ws/) to enable programmatic access to any dataset in OmicsDI or all the datasets for a specific provider (database). Clients can perform queries on the API using different metadata information such as sample details (species, tissues, etc), instrumentation (mass spectrometer, sequencer), keywords and other provided annotations. In addition, we present two different libraries in R and Python to facilitate the development of tools that can programmatically interact with the OmicsDI REST interface.}",

                  transcribed. Advanced high-throughput techniques like CLIP
                  for the genome-wide detection of RNA-protein interactions
                  have shown that post-transcriptional regulation by
                  RNA-binding proteins matches the complexity of
                  transcriptional regulation. The need for a specialized and
                  integrated analysis of RNA-based data has led to the
                  foundation of the RNA Bioinformatics Center (RBC) within the
                  German Network of Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI).
                  This paper describes the tools, services and databases

                  Furthermore, we have setup an RNA workbench within the

  abstract =	 {RNA-based regulation has become a major research topic in
                  molecular biology. The analysis of epigenetic and expression
                  data is therefore incomplete if RNA-based regulation is not
                  taken into account. Thus, it is increasingly important but
                  not yet standard to combine RNA-centric data and analysis
                  tools with other types of experimental data such as RNA-seq
                  or ChIP-seq. Here, we present the RNA workbench, a
                  comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated
                  workflows that enable the researcher to combine these two
                  worlds. Based on the Galaxy framework the workbench
                  guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption
                  to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses
                  that are independent of command-line knowledge. Currently,
                  it includes more than 50 bioinformatics tools that are
                  dedicated to different research areas of RNA biology
                  including RNA structure analysis, RNA alignment, RNA
                  annotation, RNA-protein interaction, ribosome profiling,
                  RNA-seq analysis and RNA target prediction. The workbench is
                  developed and maintained by experts in RNA bioinformatics
                  and the Galaxy framework. Together with the growing
                  community evolving around this workbench, we are committed
                  to keep the workbench up-to-date for future standards and
                  needs, providing researchers with a reliable and robust
                  framework for RNA data analysis. AVAILABILITY: The RNA
                  workbench is available at

    abstract = "{RNA has become one of the major research topics in molecular biology. As a central player in key processes regulating gene expression, RNA is in the focus of many efforts to decipher the pathways that govern the transition of genetic information to a fully functional cell. As more and more researchers join this endeavour, there is a rapidly growing demand for comprehensive collections of tools that cover the diverse layers of RNA-related research. However, increasing amounts of data, from diverse types of experiments, addressing different aspects of biological questions need to be consolidated and integrated into a single framework. Only then is it possible to connect findings from e.g. RNA-Seq experiments and methods for e.g. target predictions. To address these needs, we present the RNA Workbench 2.0 , an updated online resource for RNA related analysis. With the RNA Workbench we created a comprehensive set of analysis tools and workflows that enables researchers to analyze their data without the need for sophisticated command-line skills. This update takes the established framework to the next level, providing not only a containerized infrastructure for analysis, but also a ready-to-use platform for hands-on training, analysis, data exploration, and visualization. The new framework is available at https://rna.usegalaxy.eu , and login is free and open to all users. The containerized version can be found at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.}",

  abstract = {The increasing complexity of data and analysis methods has created an environment where scientists, who may not have formal training, are finding themselves playing the impromptu role of software engineer. While several resources are available for introducing scientists to the basics of programming, researchers have been left with little guidance on approaches needed to advance to the next level for the development of robust, large-scale data analysis tools that are amenable to integration into workflow management systems, tools, and frameworks. The integration into such workflow systems necessitates additional requirements on computational tools, such as adherence to standard conventions for robustness, data input, output, logging, and flow control. Here we provide a set of 10 guidelines to steer the creation of command-line computational tools that are usable, reliable, extensible, and in line with standards of modern coding practices.},
