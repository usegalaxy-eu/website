# Get started

Are you new to Galaxy, or returning after a long time, and looking for help to get started? Take [a guided tour](https://ecology.usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.galaxy_ui){:target="_blank"} through Galaxy's user interface. 

Want to learn about ecology analyses? Check our [tutorials](#tutorials) or take one of our guided tour:

- Introduction to species phenology study and abundance index as trends computation.

# Tutorials

We are passionate about training. So we are working in close collaboration with the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://galaxyproject.org/teach/gtn/){:target="_blank"} to develop training materials of data analyses based on Galaxy {% cite batut2017community %}. These materials hosted on the GTN GitHub repository are available online at [https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org){:target="_blank"}.

We then developed [several tutorials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/ecology/){:target="_blank"} and more will come:

- Introduction to species phenology study and abundance index as trends computation
- Introduction to Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) using Wallace R Shiny app

# Workflows

- Phenology study and abundance index as trends computation through regionalGAM
