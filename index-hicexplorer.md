# Galaxy HiCExplorer

Welcome to the Galaxy HiCExplorer -- a webserver to process, analyse and visualize Hi-C data.

## Get started with Galaxy HiCExplorer

Are you new to Galaxy, or returning after a long time, and looking for help to get started? Take <a target="_parent" href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.galaxy_ui">a guided tour</a> through Galaxy's user interface.

Take <a target="_parent" href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/tours/hixexplorer">a guided tour</a> for an introduction to Galaxy HiCExplorer and Hi-C data analysis. This tour is guides you through the Hi-C tutorial on the <a target="_parent" href="https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/epigenetics/tutorials/hicexplorer/tutorial.html">Galaxy Training Network</a>  where you can analyse Hi-C data of Drosophila melanogaster. Follow the tutorial to understand the analysis steps better or as a help which parameters are useful.

A precomputed history of the tutorial can be viewed <a target="_parent" href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/h/drosophila-melanogaster-hi-c-training">here</a>.


A more advanced tutorial is hosted on <a target="_parent" href="https://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/mES-HiC_analysis.html">readthedocs.io</a>. It is designed for the shell based version of the HiCExplorer but can be easily adapted to Galaxy HiCExplorer. In this tutorial mouse stems cells from <a target="_parent" href="https://www.genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/149">Marks et al. (2015)</a> are analysed. We provided the input fastq files in our <a target="_parent" href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/library/list#folders/F49c63be29eb6cbc1">data library</a>.

We recommend to follow the tutorial on <a target="_parent" href="https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.html">FASTQC<a/> for quality checks.
### Example data

The Galaxy Training Network tutorial uses Hi-C data from Drosophila melanogaster and is hosted on zenodo: <a target="_parent" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1183661"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1183661.svg" alt="DOI"></a>

Additional we provide the data in <a target="_parent" href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/library/list#folders/F8607ddb1c5387e36">the shared data library</a> of the Galaxy HiCExplorer. In comparison to the data hosted on zenodo it contains preprocessed intermediate files.


Galaxy HiCExplorer can process large Hi-C data. We processed Hi-C data with around 750 million reads from [Rosa-Garrido et al.](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/136/17/1613.long). Have a look at the preprocessed <a target="_parent" href='https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/h/nar-publication-750-million-reads'>files</a>.

## Workflows

To automatize different consecutive steps we provide the following workflows in three categories: From scratch (FASTQ files), from scratch (FASTQ files) and summing up replicates and if you have already your contact matrix. Many workflows require collections of FASTQ files as an input, it is shown
<a href="https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/collections/">here</a> how to create a collection. Please do not forget to check the quality of the FASTQ files with FastQC.

Please have in mind that all workflows need additional input from the user. All mapping steps are done with BWA-MEM and the correct reference genome need to be defined by the user. The correct restriction site and the bin size for hicBuildMatrix needs to be defined too. The correction of the matrix is done with the default parameters of -1.5 and 5, change this if necessary. Furthermore, the correct region and or chromosome needs to be defined for plotting the matrix, TADs or PCA.

### From scratch (FASTQ files) individual

These workflows expect collections of FASTQ files as an input. The first collections needs to have all forward strand FASTQ files and the second one all reverse FASTQ files. Please make sure that the order of the FASTQ files in both collections is equal. The order is important to associate the related forward and reverse read strand files.

The following workflows are provided:

- <a href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/w/from-scratch-to-a-contact-matrix">From scratch to a contact matrix</a>
- <a href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/w/from-scratch-to-pca">From scratch to PCA</a>
- <a href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/w/from-scratch-to-tad">From scratch to TAD</a>
- <a href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/w/from-scratch-to-pca-and-plotting">From scratch to PCA and plotting</a>
- <a href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/w/from-scratch-to-tad-and-plotting">From scratch to TAD and plotting</a>


### From scratch (FASTQ files) and summing up replicates

These workflows takes collections of FASTQ files for forward and reverse strand as an input, for each pair a contact matrix is build and all created contact matrices are summed up to one contact matrix. Use this workflow if you want to use replicates to increase statistical power of your contact matrix and the replicates are checked to be correct.

### Contact matrix as a basis

Use the following workflows if you have already created a contact matrix.

 - <a href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/w/a--b-comparments">Plot Pearson matrix and PC1 / PC2</a>
 - <a href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/w/plot-tads">Plot TADs</a>
 - <a href="https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/u/joachim-wolff/w/plot-tads-and-pc">Plot TADs and PC</a>


## Known pitfalls

Preprocssed SAM/BAM files:
To build the contact matrix the SAM/BAM files need to generated using the --reorder option from bowtie2 / hisat2 to output the SAM/BAM files in the exact same order as in the fastq files. To cover the identical reason, the SAM/BAM file should not be sorted. Please make sure your preprocessed SAM/BAM files fulfill these requirements, if not the creation of a contact matrix with hicBuildMatrix will fail.

We recommend to use BWA-MEM with the Hi-C specific parameters, as shown in our tutorials.
